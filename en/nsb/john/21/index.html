He presented himself this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There were together Simon Peter; Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Simon Peter said to them: »I am going fishing.« They told him: »We would also come with you.« They boarded the boat and caught nothing that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus stood on the beach at daybreak. The disciples did not know it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus said to them: »Children, have you anything to eat?« They answered him: »No.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said: »Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find fish.« They cast it and they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: »It is the Lord.« So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat about him for he was dressed only in undergarments, and jumped into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The other disciples came in the little boat for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net full of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they got to land, they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said: »Bring the fish you caught.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went to draw the net to land. It was full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty three in all. There were so many and yet the net was not torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus said to them: »Come and eat.« And none of the disciples dared to inquire, who are you? They just knew it was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus came, took the bread and fish and gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is the third time Jesus was seen by the disciples since he was raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they had eaten Jesus said to Simon Peter: »Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?« He said: »Yes Lord; you know I have affection for you.« Jesus said to him: »Feed my lambs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He spoke to him a second time: »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« He replied: »Yes Lord, you know I have affection for you.« Then Jesus said: »Shepherd my sheep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The third time Jesus said to him: »Simon, son of John, do you have affection for me?« Peter was grieved. Because he said to him the third time, do you have affection for me? Peter replied: »Lord, you know all things; you know I have affection for you!« Jesus said to him: »Feed my sheep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young you dressed yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you become old, you stretch out your hands and another dresses you, and carries you where you do not want to go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now this he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. After he spoke he said: »Follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following. He is the one who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said,« Lord, who is he that betrays you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Seeing this Peter said to Jesus: Lord, what shall this man do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said: »If it is my will that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This expression went among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say that he should not die. He only said: »If I will that he stay until I come, what is that to you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple that bears witness of these things, and wrote these things. That way we know that his witness is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There are many other things that Jesus did. Should all of them be written I suppose the world would not contain the books written.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
