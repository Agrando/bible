He calls his sheep by name and leads them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»When all of his own are out he leads them. The sheep follow him for they know his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They will not follow a stranger but will flee from him. They do not know the voice of a stranger.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They did not understand this illustration Jesus spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus explained: »I am the door of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Thieves and robbers came in place of me but the sheep did not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I am the door. If any man enters through me he will be saved. He will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The thief comes to steal, and kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The hired man owns no sheep. He is not the shepherd. He sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep. The wolf snatches them, and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»He leaves because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Just as the Father knows me I know the Father! I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I will also bring them. They will hear my voice and they will become one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The Father loves me. Therefore I lay down my life and I take it back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down voluntarily. I have authority jurisdictionright to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment from my Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Jews were again divided because of what Jesus said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said: »He has a demon and is mad. Why listen to him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said: »These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It was wintertime. Jesus was walking in the temple on Solomons porch the Colonnade of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Jews came to him and asked: »How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus replied: »I told you and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Fathers name bear witness of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»You do not believe because you are not my sheep!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»My sheep hear my voice. I know them and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»I give them eternal life. They will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»My Father has given them to me. He is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of the Fathers hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»The Father and I are one united in purpose.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus replied to them: »I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works do you stone me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him: »We do not stone you for good work but for blasphemy. You are a man and you make yourself like God.« (John 1:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said: »Is it not written in your law, I said, you are god-like ones?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»So if he called them god-like ones, those to whom the word of God came, and the Scriptures may not be annulled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»do you say to the one whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, you blaspheme? And this because I said, I am the Son of God. (Psalm 82:1, 6) (John 1:34; John 5:18) (Luke 1:35)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»But if I do them and you do not believe me, believe the works! That way you may know and understand that the Father is with me, and I am with the Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They tried again to capture him but he escaped from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He traveled beyond the Jordan into the place where John first baptized and stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Many came to him and they said: »John indeed did not perform a single miracle. Yet everything John said about this man was true.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Many believed in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
