Yes, the hour comes that whoever kills you will think that he offered service to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»But they do these things because they do not know the Father or me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I tell you these things so you will remember that I told you when the time comes. I did not tell this from the beginning because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I go to him that sent me. None of you asks me: Where are you going?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Now that I have spoken these things to you, sorrow fills your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Nevertheless I tell you the truth.

It will speak the things it hears and declare to you the things that are to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»It will glorify me and will take of what I have and declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»All the things the Father has are mine. That is why I said the Spirit takes what I have and declares it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»A little while and you will see me no more and again a little while, and you will see me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Some of his disciples said to one another: »What is this he says, a little while, and you see me no more and again a little while and you will see me because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»What is this that he says: A little while?

But I will see you again. Your heart will rejoice and no one can take your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»You will ask me for nothing then. Truly I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Until now you have not asked a single thing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I have spoken to you in figurative language illustrations and proverbs. The hour comes when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language. I will tell you plainly from the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»In that day you will ask in my name. I do not say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you.
