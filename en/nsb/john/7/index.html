He would not walk in Judea because the Jews looked for ways to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>It was time for the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His brothers said to him: »Leave here and go to Judea. That way your disciples also may see the works that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»No one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For his brothers did not express active faith in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus replied: »My time is not yet here but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The world has no reason to hate you. But it hates me because I testify that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You go to this feast. I will not go to this feast for my time has not yet come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When he said these words to them he stayed in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When his brothers left he secretly went to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews looked for him at the feast and they said: »Where is he?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There was much whispering among the people concerning him. Some said: »He is a good man.« Others said: »No, he deceives the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However no man spoke openly about him out of fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Midway through the feast Jesus went to the temple and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews wondered saying: »How does this man know letters? He has had no formal education.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus replied: »My teaching is not my own. It is his who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»If any man does his will he shall know the teachings. He will know if it is from God, or whether I speak from myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»He who speaks from his own authority seeks his own glory. He who seeks glory for the one who sent him is true. Unrighteousness is not found in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Did Moses give you the law? / Yet none of you obey the law! Why do you seek to kill me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The crowd answered: »You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus responded: »I did one work and you all marveled because of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Moses gave you circumcision. Not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers. And you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»A man receives circumcision on the Sabbath. That way the Law of Moses may not be broken. Are you angry with me, because I made an entire man whole on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Do not judge according to appearance! Judge a righteous judgment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Some in Jerusalem asked: »Is this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»He spoke openly and they said nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»How is it we know where this man is from but when the Christ comes no one will know where he is from?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus shouted in the temple: »You know me and from where I came. I did not come on my own. He who sent me is true and you do not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»I know him because I am from him and he sent me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They looked for a way to capture him. But no man laid his hand on him. This is because his hour had not yet arrived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Many in the crowd believed in him. They asked: »When the Christ comes will he do more signs than those this man has done?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things concerning him. The chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to capture him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus therefore said: »I am with you a little while. Then I go to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»You will seek me and will not find me. You cannot come where I am going.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews said among themselves: »Where will this man go that we shall not find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»What is this word that he said: You will seek me, and will not find me; and you cannot come where I am going?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and shouted in a loud voice: »If any man thirst let him come to me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Rivers of living water will flow from the innermost being of the man who believes in me. This is according to the scriptures.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He spoke this by the Spirit. Those who believed in him were to receive the Spirit. The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When they heard these words some of the crowd proclaimed: »This truly is the prophet!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said: »This is the Christ.« But some asked: »Does the Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»Do the Scriptures say that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there arose a division in the crowd because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Some of them wanted to apprehend him. Yet no man laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The chief priests and Pharisees asked the officers: »Why did you not bring him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»No man has ever spoken the way he speaks,« they replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees therefore answered them: »Are you also deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»This crowd does not know the law. It is contemptible«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus spoke to them. He is the Pharisee who earlier went to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to find out what he has done?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They replied: »Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then each man went to his own house.questionable text</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
