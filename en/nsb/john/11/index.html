He lived at Bethany where his sisters Mary and Martha lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>This is the same Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The sisters therefore sent for the Lord, They said: »The one for whom you have great affection is sick.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When Jesus heard it he said: »This sickness will not end in death. It is for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When he heard the news he stayed where he was for two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After this he said to the disciples: »Let us go to Judea again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The disciples said: »Rabbi, the Jews were seeking to stone you and you go there?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus answered: »Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he told them: »Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep. I go to wake him out of sleep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The disciples said, »Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he would recover.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus spoke of his death. They thought he spoke of taking rest in sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus said plainly: »Lazarus is dead!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, for it will help you believe. Let us go to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: »Let us also go that we may die with him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus arrived he found Lazarus had been in the grave four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to console them about their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Martha went out to meet Jesus and Mary sat in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Martha said to Jesus: »Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Even now I know that what ever you ask of God he will give it to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus replied: »Your brother will rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha exclaimed: »I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said: »I am the resurrection and the life. He who puts active faith in me will live, even if he dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Whoever lives and puts active faith in me will never die. Do you believe this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said: »Yes Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who is to come into the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After she said this she went away and secretly called her sister Mary. She said: »The teacher is here and calls you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Mary got up quickly and went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus had not yet arrived at the village and was still at the place where Martha met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews were with her in the house, consoling her. They saw Mary get up quickly and leave. So they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When Mary saw Jesus she fell down at his feet. She said: »Lord; if you had been here my brother would not have died.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus groaned in his spirit and was troubled when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He asked: »Where have you laid him?« They answered: »Come and see Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Jews therefore said: »Look how deeply he loved him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Some of them said: »This man opened the eyes of the blind. Could he have prevented this man from dying?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Again Jesus groaned in himself. He went to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said: »Take away the stone.« Martha, the sister of the dead man said: »Lord by now the body has decayed for he has been dead four days.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to her: »Did I not say that if you believe you shall see the glory of God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said: »Father, I thank you that you hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»I knew that you always hear me. But because of the crowd that stands here I said it, that they may believe that you did send me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After he finished he cried out loud: »Lazarus, come out!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He that was dead came out. He was bound hand and foot with grave-clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus commanded them: »Unwrap him and let him go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what he did, believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council. They asked what they should do. »This man does many signs and miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»If we let him alone all men will believe in him. Then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Caiaphas the high priest that year said to them: »You know nothing at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people. That way the whole nation will not perish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He did not say this from his own understanding. As high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He would die for the nation. He would also gather together the children of God that are scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus did not walk openly among the Jews anymore. He departed into the wilderness of the nearby country. He and his disciples stayed at a city called Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>It was the Jewish Passover. Many went out of the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They searched for Jesus. They stood in the temple speaking to one another: »What do you think? Will he come to the feast?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that, if any man knew where he was, he should report it that they might seize him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
