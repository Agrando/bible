He asked Philip: »Where will we buy enough bread to feed them?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said this to test him for he knew what he would do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Philip answered: »Two hundred shillings worth of bread is not sufficient for everyone to take a little.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Andrew, Simon Peters brother, one of his disciples said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish. What are these among so many?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said: »Make the people sit down.« There were about five thousand men who sat down on the grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus gave thanks and then he distributed the loaves along with the fish to those sitting on the grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were filled he told the disciples to gather up the broken pieces left over so nothing would be wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They gathered twelve baskets of leftovers after everyone had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the people saw the miracle performed they said: »Truly this is the prophet who came into the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus knew that they were about to take him by force and make him king. So he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That evening his disciples went to the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They boarded a boat to travel over the sea to Capernaum. It was dark and Jesus had not yet come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A great wind made the sea rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They rowed about four miles and saw Jesus walking on the sea. He came close to the boat. They were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them: »It is I. Do not be afraid!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They eagerly brought him into the boat. The boat soon arrived at the land where they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The next day the crowd stood by the side of the sea. Jesus entered the only boat while his disciples went away alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Small boats from Tiberias came there to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the crowd saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there they got into the boats and traveled to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They found him on the other side of the sea and said: »Rabbi Teacher when did you come here?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, you seek me not because you saw miracles but because you ate of the loaves and were full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Do not work for food that perishes but for food that offers everlasting life. The Son of man will give you this food. The Father, even God, has set his seal upon him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They asked: »What must we do, that we may work the works of God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered: »This is the work of God, that you have an active faith in the one whom he has sent.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They asked: »What do you offer for a sign miracle that we may see and believe you? What work will you do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness. It is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus responded: »I speak the truth! It was not Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven. My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven. It gives life to the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They responded: »Lord, always give us this bread.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus replied: »I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not hunger. The one who puts active faith in me will never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»I told you. You have seen me and yet do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»That which the Father gives me will come to me. I will not reject him who comes to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»I do not do my own will. I came down from heaven to do the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»This is the will of him that sent me that I should not lose any of those he has given me, but I should raise them up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»For this is the will of my Father. Every one who sees the Son and puts active faith in him will have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews complained about him. This is because he said I am the bread that came down out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They said: »Is Jesus the son of Joseph? We know his father and mother. How does he now say, I came down out of heaven?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered: »Stop complaining and saying things against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him. I will resurrect him raise him up in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»It is written in the prophets: Jehovah shall teach them all. Every one who hears the Father and has learned comes to me. (Jeremiah 31:34)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»No one has seen the Father. Only he who is from God, He has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Truly, truly I tell you, he who believes has everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»This is the bread that comes down out of heaven that a man may eat of it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»I am the living bread that came down out of heaven. If any man eats of this bread he will live forever. Yes and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews argued with one another saying: »How can this man give us his flesh to eat?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Jesus responded to them: »Truly I tell you if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood you will not have life in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>»He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life! I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>»For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>»He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides with me, and I with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>»The living Father sent me and I live because of the Father. He who takes me for his food will live because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>»This is the bread that came down out of heaven. It is not like the bread manna the fathers ate and then died. He who eats this bread will live forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>He said these things in the synagogue when he taught in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>When they heard this many of his disciples said: »This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>He knew his disciples complained about this. Jesus said: »Does this cause you to stumble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>»What if you see the Son of man ascending where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>»It is the spirit that gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I spoke to you are spirit and life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>»There are some of you who do not believe.« Jesus knew from the beginning whom they were who did not believe and who would betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>He stated: »For this reason listen to what I say. No man can come to me, except it be given to him from the Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>After this many of his disciples returned to their old ways. They did not walk with him anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Jesus asked the twelve: »Will you also go away?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter answered him: »Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of everlasting life!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>»We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus replied: »Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil false accuserslandererdemon«.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot one of the twelve, for he would betray him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
