Joseph was a seventeen-year-old young man. He took care of the flocks with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his fathers wives. Joseph told his father about the bad things his brothers were doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jacob Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because Joseph had been born in Israels old age. So he made Joseph a special multicolored robe with long sleeves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Josephs brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them. They hated Joseph and could not speak to him in a friendly way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One time Joseph had a dream. He told his brothers about it and they hated him even more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said: »Please listen to the dream I had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»We were all in the field tying up sheaves of wheat. My sheaf got up and stood up straight. Yours formed a circle around mine and bowed down to it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Do you think you are going to be a king and rule over us?« his brothers asked. So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of what he said about them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joseph had another dream and told his brothers: »I had another dream, in which I saw the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He also told the dream to his father. His father scolded him. »What kind of a dream is that? Do you think that your mother, your brothers, and I are going to come and bow down to you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Josephs brothers were jealous of him. His father kept thinking about the whole matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His brothers went to Shechem to take care of their fathers flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His father Jacob said to him: »I want you to go to your brothers. They are with the sheep near Shechem.« »Yes, I will go,« Joseph answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His father said: »Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing. Then come back and let me know.« So he sent him from Hebron Valley. Joseph was near Shechem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and wandering through the fields, when a man asked: »What are you looking for?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Joseph answered: »I am looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep. Can you tell me where they are?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»They are not here anymore,« the man replied. »I heard them say they were going to Dothan.« Joseph soon found his brothers in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Before he arrived, they saw him coming and made plans to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said to one another: »Look, here comes the hero of those dreams!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Let us kill him and throw him into a water pit. We can say that some wild animal ate him. Then we will see what happens to those dreams.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them. »Let us not kill him,« he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Do not murder him or even harm him. Just throw him into a dry well out here in the desert.« Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his fancy coat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They put him into a water pit. It had no water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As they sat down to eat, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying the materials for cosmetics, medicine, and embalming. They were on their way to take them to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Judah asked his brothers: »What will we gain by killing our brother and covering up his death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Let us sell him to the Ishmaelites. Let us not hurt him, because he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.« His brothers agreed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Some of the Midianite traders approached. The brothers pulled Joseph out of the well and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites. They took him to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Reuben came back to the pit and found that Joseph was not there. He tore his clothes in sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He returned to his brothers and said: »The boy is not there! What am I going to do?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then they killed a goat and dipped Josephs robe in its blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They took the robe to their father and said: »We found this. Does it belong to your son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He recognized it and said: »Yes, it is his! Some wild animal has killed him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jacob tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. He mourned for his son a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>All his sons and daughters came to comfort him. However, he refused to be comforted. He said: »I will go down to the grave still mourning for my son.« So he continued to mourn for his son Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Meanwhile, in Egypt the Midianites sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of the kings officers, who was the captain of the palace guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
