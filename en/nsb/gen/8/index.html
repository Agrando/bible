He sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The springs of the deep and the floodgates of the skies were closed. So the rain stopped falling from the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>On the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The waters continued to recede until the tenth month. On the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After forty days Noah opened the window he constructed in the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He sent out a raven. It kept flying back and forth until the water dried up from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The dove, however, could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth. It returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and held the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By the first day of the first month of Noahs six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>God said to Noah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground. They will multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds, everything that moves on the earth came out of the ark, one kind after another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Noah built an altar to Jehovah and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: »Never again will I curse the ground because of man, for the intent of his heart is evil from childhood. I will never again destroy every living creature, as I have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will never cease.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
