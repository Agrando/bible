She became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said: »With the help of Jehovah I have brought forth a man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As time went by, Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn firstlings of his flock. Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and his offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He did not look with favor on Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his face was downcast he had a bad attitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah said to Cain: »Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»If you do what is right, will not your attitude improve? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door. It desires to have you, but you must master it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehovah asked Cain: »Where is your brother Abel?« »I do not know,« he replied. »Am I my brothers keeper?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah said: »What have you done? Listen! Your brothers blood life cries out to me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer vagabond on the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Cain said to Jehovah: »My punishment is more than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»You are driving me from the land today. I will be hidden from your presence. I will be a restless homeless wanderer on the earth. And whoever finds me will kill me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah replied to him: »If anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.« Then Jehovah put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cain went out from Jehovahs presence and lived in the land of Nod Fugitiveness. Nod is east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Cain had intercourse with his wife. She became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Later Cain built a city. He named it after his son Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His brothers name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of copper and iron. Tubal-Cains sister was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Lamech said to his wives: »Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Adam had intercourse with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth. She said: »God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on proclaim the name of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
