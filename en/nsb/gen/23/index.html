These were the years of the life of Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sarah died in Kiriath-arba that is, Hebron in the land of Canaan. Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to cry because of her death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Abraham left the side of his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He said: »I am a stranger with no permanent home. Let me have some of your property for a tomb that I can bury my dead wife.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Hittites answered Abraham:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Listen to us, my lord. You are a mighty leader among us. Bury your dead in one of our best tombs. Not one of us will withhold from you his tomb for burying your dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Abraham got up and bowed to the people of that region, the Hittites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said: »If you are willing to let me bury my wife here, please ask Ephron son of Zohar</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>to sell me Machpelah Cave. It is near the edge of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for its full price here in your presence. Then I can own it as a burial ground.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ephron was sitting with the other Hittites at the meeting place at the city gate. He answered in the hearing of everyone there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Hear me my lord, I give you the field, including the cave. It is yours. With my own people as witnesses, I freely give it to you as a burial place for your dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Once again, Abraham bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land. He said: »If you will only please listen to me. I will give the price of the field. Accept it from me that I may bury my dead there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ephron answered Abraham:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»My lord, listen to me. It is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver. What is that between you and me? So bury your dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, commercial standard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ephrons field at Machpelah, east of Mamre, was sold to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His property included the field with the cave in it as well as all the trees inside the boundaries of the field.
