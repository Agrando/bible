Jehovah did for Sarah what he had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age. It was at the very time God had promised him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Abraham gave the name Isaac he laughs to the son Sarah bore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him as God had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sarah said: »God brought me laughter. Everyone who hears about this will laugh on account of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She added: »Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The child grew and was weaned. Abraham held a big feast on the day Isaac was weaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was laughing in mockery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She said to Abraham: »Get rid of that slave woman and her son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This upset Abraham because of his son Ishmael.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>God said to Abraham: »Do not be upset about the boy and your slave. Listen to what Sarah says, because through Isaac your descendants will carry on your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I will make the slaves son into a nation also, because he is your child.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Early the next morning Abraham took bread and a container of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder. He also gave her the boy and sent her on her way. So she left and wandered around in the desert near Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She sat across from him at a distance. She thought: »I cannot watch the boy die." She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>God heard the lad crying. The angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her: »What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear! God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Arise, lift up the lad. Hold him by the hand. I will make him a great nation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then God opened her eyes. She saw a well of water. She filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>God was with the lad, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham. They said: »God is with you in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity. Consider the kindness that I have shown to you. Please show it to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Abraham said: »I swear it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water that the servants of Abimelech had seized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Abimelech said: »I do not know who has done this thing. You did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech. The two of them made a covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abimelech asked Abraham: »What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He said: »You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there the two of them took an oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba. There he called on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for many days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
