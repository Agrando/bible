Jehovah appeared to him and said: »I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»I will establish my covenant between us. I will greatly increase your numbers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Abram fell on his face and God said to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»This is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»You will no longer be called Abram Exalted Father. Your name will be Abraham means Father of Many. I have made you a father of many nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I will make you very fruitful.
