Make an altar to God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jacob said to his family and those who were with him: »Get rid of the foreign gods that you have. Wash yourselves until you are ritually clean. Change your clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»After that let us go to Bethel. I will make an altar there to God, who answered me when I was troubled and who has been with me wherever I have gone.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings. He buried them under the oak big tree near Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jacob and his family traveled through Canaan. God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Finally, they reached Bethel, also known as Luz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jacob built an altar there and called it God of Bethel. That was the place where God appeared to him when he was running from Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Deborah died. She was the servant who cared for Rebekah from childhood. She was buried near Bethel, under the holy tree. They named it Allon-bacuth weeping tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram. He blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>God said to him: »Your name is Jacob. You shall no longer be called Jacob. Israel shall be your name.« Thus He called him Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God also said: »I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and an assembly of nations will come from you. Kings shall come forth from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you. I will give the land to your descendants after you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jacob set up a memorial, a stone marker, to mark the place where God had spoken with him. He poured a wine offering and olive oil on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel House of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After that they moved from Bethel. When there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel went into labor. She had severe labor pains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When one of her pains hit, the midwife said: »Do not be afraid. You have another son!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Rachel was dying! With her last breath she named her son Ben-oni Son of My Sorrow, but his father named him Benjamin Son of My Right Hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Rachel died and was buried on the way to Bethlehem Ephrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jacob set up a stone as a marker for her grave. The same marker is at Rachels grave today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Israel moved on again. He pitched his tent by the tower of Eder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While Israel lived in that region, Reuben went to bed with his fathers concubine Bilhah. Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sons of Leah were Jacobs firstborn Reuben, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sons of Rachels slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The sons of Leahs slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These were Jacobs sons, who were born in Paddan-aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jacob came home to his father Isaac, to Mamres city, Kiriath-arba Hebron. Abraham and Isaac had lived there for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Isaac was one hundred and eighty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Isaac took his last breath and died. He joined his ancestors in death at a very old age. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
