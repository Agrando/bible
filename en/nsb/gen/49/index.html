He said: »Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen to you in the future.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Come together and listen, sons of Jacob. Listen to your father Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Reuben, you are my firstborn; you are my strength and the first child of my manhood. You are the proudest and strongest of all my sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»You are like a raging flood. But you will not be the most important, for you slept with my concubine. You dishonored your fathers bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Simeon and Levi are brothers. They use their weapons to commit violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I will not join in their secret talks. I will not take part in their meetings. They killed people in anger. They crippled bulls for sport.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»A curse is on their anger, because it is so fierce. And a curse is on their fury, because it is so cruel. I will scatter them throughout the land of Israel. I will disperse them among its people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Judah, your brothers will praise you. You hold your enemies by the neck. Your brothers will bow down before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Judah is like a lion, killing his victim and returning to his den. He is like a lion stretching out and lying down. No one dares disturb him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The royal scepter shall not depart from Judah. His descendants will always rule. Nations will bring him tribute and bow in obedience before him. This, until Shiloh comes and all will obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»He will tie his donkey to a grapevine, his colt to the best vine. He will wash his clothes in wine, his garments in the blood of grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»His eyes are darker than wine. His teeth are whiter than milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Zebulun will live by the coast. He will have ships by the coast. His border will go as far as Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the saddlebags.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»When he sees that his resting place is good and that the land is pleasant, he will bend his back to the burden and will become a slave laborer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Dan will be a snake on a road, a viper on a path that bites a horses heels so that its rider falls backwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I wait with hope for your salvation, O Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders.

His arms remained limber because of the help of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»because of the God of your father who helps you, because of the Almighty who blesses you from the heavens above, blessings from the deep springs below the ground, blessings from breasts and womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The blessings of your father are greater than the blessings of the oldest mountains and the riches of the ancient hills. May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the prince among his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Benjamin is a ravenous wolf. In the morning and evening he destroys his enemies.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These are the twelve tribes of Israel.

I want you to bury me in Machpelah Cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Abraham bought the cave from Ephron the Hittite to use as a burial place. It is near the field of Machpelah. It is also near the town of Mamre in Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there. Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there. I also buried Leah there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons.
