Shall I send your son back to the land you came from?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Abraham answered: »Make sure that you do not send my son back there!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Jehovah, the God of heaven, took me from my fathers house and from the land of my birth. He spoke to me and swore to me. He said: I will give this land to your descendants. He will send his angel before you. You will take a wife for my son from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You will be free from this oath if the woman is not willing to follow you. Only do not take my son back there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master. He swore to him concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and then set out with a variety of good things of his masters in his hand. He arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time. This is the time when women go out to draw water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He said: »O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today. Show loving-kindness to my master Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I am standing by the spring. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Let there be the girl to whom I say: Please let down your jar so that I may drink,' and who answers: 'Drink, and I will water your camels also.' May she be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown loving-kindness to my master.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Before he finished praying, Rebekah came with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abrahams brother Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The girl was a very attractive virgin. No man had ever had sexual intercourse with her. She went to the spring and filled her jar, and came back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The servant ran to meet her and said: »Please give me a drink of water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Drink, my lord,« she said. She quickly lowered her jar to her hand and gave him a drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When she finished giving him a drink, she said: »I will also keep drawing water for your camels until they have had enough to drink.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>She quickly emptied her jar into the water trough. Then she ran back to the well to draw more water. She drew enough for all his camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The man quietly watched her to see whether or not Jehovah made his trip successful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a fifth of an ounce and two gold bracelets weighing four ounces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said: »Please tell me who your father is. Is there room in his house for my men and me to spend the night?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»My father is Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah,« she answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»There is plenty of straw and fodder at our house. There is also a place for you to stay.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The man knelt down and worshiped Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said: »Praise Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham. He has faithfully kept his promise to my master. Jehovah has led me straight to my masters relatives.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The young woman ran to her mothers house and told the entire story.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Rebeccas brother was named Laban. He ran outside to go to the well where Abrahams servant was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Laban had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sisters arms and had heard her say what the man told her. He went to Abrahams servant, who was standing by his camels at the well,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and said: »Come home with me. You are a man Jehovah has blessed. Why are you standing out here? I have a room ready for you in my house. There is a place for your camels.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The man went into the house. Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and fodder. Then he brought water for Abrahams servant and his men to wash their feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Food was brought. The man said: »I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.« Laban responded: »Go ahead and speak.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I am the servant of Abraham,« he began.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Jehovah has greatly blessed my master and made him a rich man. He has given him flocks of sheep and goats, cattle, silver, gold, male and female slaves, camels, and donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Sarah, my masters wife, did not have any children until she was very old. Then she had a son, and my master has given him everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»I solemnly promised my master I would do what he said. He told me: Do not choose a wife for my son from the women in this land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for my son from among my relatives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»I asked my master: What if the young woman refuses to come with me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»He said to me: Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you to make your journey successful. You will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»If my relatives do not give her to you, then you will be free from my oath.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»I came to the spring today. I prayed to Jehovah: God of my master Abraham, if now you will make my journey successful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»make it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, »Please let me drink a little water from your jar,«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»And she will say to me, »You drink, and I will draw for your camels also,« let her be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my masters son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»Before I had finished speaking in my heart, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew, and I said to her, Please let me drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will water your camels also; so I drank, and she watered the camels also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Then I asked her: Whose daughter are you? She said: The daughter of Bethuel, Nahors son, whom Milcah bore to him. I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»I bowed low and worshiped Jehovah, and praised Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham. He guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my masters kinsman for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»If you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, let me know, that I may turn to the right hand or the left.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Laban and Bethuel replied: »The matter comes from Jehovah. We cannot speak to you bad or good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go. Let her be the wife of your masters son, as Jehovah has spoken.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Abrahams servant heard their answer. Then he bowed down to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The servant took out gold and silver jewelry and clothes and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they got up in the morning, he said: »Let me go back to my master.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Her brother and mother replied: »Let the girl stay with us ten days or so. After that she may go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He said: »Do not make us stay. Jehovah has made my journey a success. Let me go back to my master.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>They answered: »Let us call her and find out what she has to say.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>They called Rebecca and asked: »Do you want to go with this man?« »Yes,« she answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They allowed Rebecca and her old family servant to go with Abrahams servant and his men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>They gave Rebecca their blessing in these words: »May you, sister, become the mother of millions! May your descendants conquer the cities of their enemies!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Rebecca and her young women got ready. They mounted the camels to go with Abrahams servant, and they all started out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Isaac had come into the wilderness of »The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.« He was staying in the southern part of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>He went out in the early evening to take a walk in the fields. He saw camels coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Rebecca saw Isaac and she got down from her camel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>She asked Abrahams servant: »Who is that man walking toward us in the field?« »He is my master,« the servant answered. So she took her veil scarf and covered her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>The servant told Isaac everything he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Isaac brought Rebecca into the tent that his mother Sarah had lived in. She became his wife. Isaac loved Rebecca. He was comforted for the loss of his mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
