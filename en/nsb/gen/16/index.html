She had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>She said to Abram: »Jehovah has kept me from having children. Go sleep with my maidservant. Perhaps I can build a family through her.« Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>After Abram lived in Canaan ten years, Sarai, his wife, gave her Egyptian maidservant Hagar to her husband to be his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Abram had intercourse with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Sarai said to Abram: »You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms; she knows she is pregnant and she despises me. May Jehovah judge between you and me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Your servant is in your hands,« Abram said. »Do with her whatever you think best.« Then Sarai mistreated Hagar. So she ran away from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The angel of Jehovah found Hagar near a spring in the desert. It was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said: »Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?« »I am running away from my mistress Sarai,« she answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the angel of Jehovah told her: »Go back to your mistress and submit to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovahs angel also said: »You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael means: God hears. Jehovah has heard of your misery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»He Ishmael will be a wild donkey of a man. His hand will be against everyone and everyones hand against him. He will live in hostility toward all his brothers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>She called the name of Jehovah, who spoke to her: »You are the God who sees me, for she said, I have not seen the one who sees me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.

Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
