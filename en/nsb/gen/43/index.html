He said: You will not be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»If you let our brother go with us, we will go and buy food for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»If you will not let him go, we will not go. The man said to us: You will not be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Israel asked: »Why have you made trouble for me by telling the man you had another brother?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They answered: »The man kept asking about our family and us. He asked, Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother? We simply answered his questions. How could we possibly know he would say, Bring your brother here?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Judah said to his father Israel: »Send the boy along with me. Let us get going so that we will not starve to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I guarantee that he will come back. You can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and place him here in front of you, you can blame me the rest of my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»If we had not waited so long, we could have made this trip twice by now.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Their father Israel said: »If that is the way it has to be, then take the man a gift. Put some of the best products of the land in your bags. Take a little balm, a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Take twice as much money with you, because you must take back the money that was returned in the top of your sacks. Maybe it was a mistake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Take your brother and return at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»May God Almighty cause the man to have pity on you, so that he will give Benjamin and your other brother back to you. As for me, if I must lose my children, I must lose them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the brothers took the gifts and twice as much money, and set out for Egypt with Benjamin. There they presented themselves to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He saw Benjamin and told the servant in charge of his house: »Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and cook it, so they can eat with me at noon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The servant did as he was told. He took the brothers to Josephs house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On the way they were worried and started talking: »We are being taken there because of the money that was put back in our sacks last time. He will arrest us and take our donkeys. He will make us his slaves!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they arrived at Josephs house, they said to the servant in charge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»We came to Egypt once before to buy grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»When we stopped for the night, we each found in our grain sacks the exact amount we had paid. We have brought that money back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»We brought enough money to buy more grain. We do not know who put the money in our sacks.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»It is all right,« the servant replied. »Do not worry. The God you and your father worship must have put the money there, because your money came first to me.« Then he brought Simeon out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The servant took them into Josephs house. He gave them water to wash their feet. He also tended their donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The brothers prepared their gifts so they could give them to Joseph at noon. For they had heard they were going to eat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Joseph came home and they gave him the gifts they had brought. They bowed down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Joseph asked how they were. He said: »What about your elderly father? Is he still alive?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They answered: »Your servant our father is still alive and well.« Again they bowed down to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Joseph looked around and saw his brother Benjamin. He said: »This must be the youngest brother you told me about. God bless you, my son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Right away he rushed off to his room and cried because of his love for Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>After washing his face and returning, he was able to control himself. He said: »Serve the meal!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Joseph was served at a table by himself. His brothers were served at another. The Egyptians sat at yet another table. This is because Egyptians felt it was disgusting to eat with Hebrews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>To the surprise of Josephs brothers, they were seated in front of him according to their ages, from the oldest to the youngest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They were served food from Josephs table. And Benjamin was given five times as much as each of the others. So Josephs brothers drank with him and had a good time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
