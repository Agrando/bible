Her name was Keturah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan, and the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were Keturahs descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>While Abraham was still alive, he gave gifts to the sons of Hagar and Keturah. He also sent their sons to live in the east far from his son Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he took his last breath and died at a very old age. After a long and full life, he joined his ancestors in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This was the field Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. Abraham and Sarah his wife were buried there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi. The Well of the Living One, My Beholder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is the genealogy of Ishmael, Abrahams son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarahs maid, bore to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and Mishma and Dumah and Massa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps: twelve leaders according to their tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ishmael lived one hundred and thirty-seven years. Then he died and was gathered to his ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His descendants lived as nomads from the region of Havilah to Shur. This is near Egypt, in the direction of Assyria. He died in the presence of all his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This is the genealogy of Abrahams son Isaac and his descendants. Abraham was the father of Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram, and sister of Laban the Aramean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Isaac prayed to Jehovah for his wife because she was childless. Jehovah answered his prayer. His wife Rebekah became pregnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>She was going to have twins. Before they were born they struggled against each other in her womb. She said: »Why should something like this happen to me?« She asked Jehovah for an answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jehovah said: »Two nations are within you. You will give birth to two rival peoples. One will be stronger than the other. The older will serve the younger.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The time came for her to give birth. She gave birth to twin sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The first one was reddish. His skin was like a hairy robe, so he was named Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The second one was born holding on tightly to the heel of Esau. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The boys grew up. Esau became a skilled hunter, a man who loved the outdoors. Jacob was an upright man who stayed at home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Isaac preferred Esau. This is because he enjoyed eating the animals Esau killed. Rebecca preferred Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>One day while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from hunting. He was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He said to Jacob: »I am starving! Give me some of that red stuff.« That is why he was named Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jacob answered: »I will give it to you if you give me your birthright as the firstborn son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Esau said: »All right! I am about to die. What good are rights as firstborn to me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jacob answered: »First make a vow that you will give me your birthright.« Esau made the vow and gave his rights as firstborn to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jacob gave him some bread and some of the soup. He ate and drank and then got up and left. Esau did not care about his birthright.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
