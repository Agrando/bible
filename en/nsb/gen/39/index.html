Potiphar, one of Pharaohs Egyptian officials and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jehovah was with Joseph. Joseph became a successful man. He worked in the house of his Egyptian master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Josephs master saw that Jehovah was with him. Jehovah made him succeed in everything he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Potiphar was pleased with him and made him his personal servant. He put him in charge of his house and everything he owned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah blessed the Egyptians household and everything he had in his house and in his fields because of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Potiphar turned over everything he had to the care of Joseph. He did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Joseph was well built and good-looking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Soon his masters wife began to desire Joseph and asked him to go to bed with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He refused, and said to her: »My master does not have to concern himself with anything in the house, because I am here. He has put me in charge of everything he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»No one in this house is greater than I. He has kept nothing back from me except you. You are his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She kept asking Joseph day after day. He refused to go to bed with her or be with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>One day he went into the house to do his work. None of the household servants were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She grabbed him by his coat and said: »Come to bed with me!« But he ran outside and left his coat in her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When she realized that he had gone but had left his coat behind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>she called her household servants and said to them: »Look! My husband brought this Hebrew here to fool around with us. He came in and tried to go to bed with me. I screamed as loud as I could.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»When he heard me scream, he ran out of the house, leaving his coat with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Potiphars wife kept Josephs coat until her husband came home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She said: »That Hebrew slave of yours tried to rape me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»When I screamed for help, he left his coat and ran out of the house.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Potiphar became very angry</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and threw Joseph in the same prison where the kings prisoners were kept. While Joseph was in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah helped him and was good to him. He even made the jailer like Joseph so much that</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>he put him in charge of the other prisoners and of everything that was done in the jail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The jailer did not worry about anything, because Jehovah was with Joseph and made him successful in all that he did.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
