It was the same place where Joseph was imprisoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph. He took care of them. After they had been confined for some time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>both prisoners, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, had dreams one night. Each man had a dream with its own special meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Joseph saw that they were upset when he came to them in the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He asked these officials of Pharaoh who were with him in his masters prison: »Why do you look so unhappy today?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»We both had dreams,« they answered him, »but there is no one to tell us what they mean.« »Is it not God who can tell what dreams mean?« Joseph asked them. »Tell me all about them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said: »In my dream a grapevine with three branches appeared in front of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Soon after it sprouted it blossomed. Then its clusters ripened into grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Pharaohs cup was in my hand. I took the grapes and squeezed them into it. I put the cup in Pharaohs hand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»This is what it means,« Joseph said to him. »The three branches are three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»In the next three days Pharaoh will release you and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaohs cup in his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Remember me when things go well for you. Please do me a favor. Mention me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews. And here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph: »I also saw in my dream three baskets of white bread on my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The top basket contained all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh. The birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joseph answered: »This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»In three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you. He will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It happened on the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday that he made a feast for all his servants. He lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaohs hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He did indeed hang the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph. In fact he forgot him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
