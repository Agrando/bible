He said to the woman: »Did God really say, you must not eat from any tree in the garden?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The woman said to the serpent: »We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»However, God did say: You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not touch it, or you will die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»You will not die,« the serpent said to the woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened. Then you will be like God, knowing good and evil.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the eyes of both of them were opened. They realized they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The man and his wife heard the sound voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day. They hid from Jehovah, among the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Jehovah God called to the man: »Where are you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He Adam answered: »I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said: »Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Adam said: »The woman you put here with me gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jehovah God said to the Eve: »What is this you have done?« The woman answered: »The serpent deceived me, and I ate.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jehovah God said to the serpent: »Because you have done this you are cursed above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»And I will put enmity hostilityhatred between you and the woman, and between your offspring seed and hers. He will bruise overwhelmcrush you in the head, and you will bruise overwhelmcrush him in the heel.« (Romans 16:20)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to the woman: »I will greatly increase your pains in childbirth; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to Adam: »Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, You must not eat of it, cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»It will produce thorns and thistles for you. You will eat the plants of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»You will eat your food by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground. You came from the ground. For dust you are and to dust you will return.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jehovah said: »The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore Jehovah God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
