He was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He looked up and noticed three men coming toward him. He ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Abraham said: »My Lord, if I have now found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Please. Let a little water be brought. Wash your feet and rest under the tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will bring a bite to eat to refresh you. Stay a while before you continue your journey.« They responded: »Very well, do as you have said.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said: »Quick! Make ready three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Abraham ran to the herd. He selected a fat calf and told a servant to butcher it and prepare it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He took butter and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree as they ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they said to him: »Where is Sarah your wife« ? He responded: »Here, in the tent.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said: »Next year I will give you and Sarah a son.« Sarah was listening in the tent door behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself. She said to herself: "After I have grown old, shall I have a baby? My lord is old also."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah said to Abraham: »Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I surely bear a child, since I am old?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life. Sarah shall have a son!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Sarah denied saying: »I did not laugh!« She was afraid. He said: »But you did laugh!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the men stood up from their meal and started in the direction of Sodom. Abraham went with them to send them on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah said: »Shall I hide what I am doing from Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Abraham will definitely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household; and that they may remain in the righteous and just way of Jehovah. Jehovah will bring to Abraham what he told him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jehovah said: »Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I will go down now and see whether they have done the bad things I have been told. Then I will know.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The men left there and went toward Sodom. Abraham still stood before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Abraham came near and said: »Will you destroy the righteous with the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city. Would you also destroy the place and not spare it because the righteous people are there?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Surely you would not do that! Would you slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked? Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jehovah said: »If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, I will spare the entire place for their sakes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Abraham answered and said: »Indeed now, I who am only dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous. Would you destroy the entire city for lack of five?« So He God said: »If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham spoke again: »Suppose there should be forty found there?« God replied: »I will not do it for the sake of forty.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Abraham then said: »Do not be angry, and let me speak. Suppose thirty should be found there?« God replied: »I will not do it if I find thirty there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Abraham then said: »Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to Jehovah: Suppose twenty should be found there?« God replied: »I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Abraham again queried: »Please do not be angry as I speak once more: Suppose ten should be found there?« God said: »I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jehovah went his way as soon as he finished speaking with Abraham. Abraham returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
