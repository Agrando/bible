He cried over him, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Joseph gave orders to embalm his fathers body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>It took forty days, which is the normal time for embalming. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the time of mourning was over, Joseph said to the kings officials: »Please take this message to the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»When my father was about to die, he made me promise him that I would bury him in the tomb that he had prepared in the land of Canaan. Please, let me go and bury my father. Then I will come back.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The king replied: »By all means go and bury your father, as you promised you would.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joseph went to bury his father. All the kings officials, the senior men of his court, and all the leading men of Egypt went with Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>His family, including his brothers, and the rest of his fathers family all went with him. Only their small children and their sheep, goats, and cattle stayed in the region of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Men in chariots and men on horseback also went with him. It was a very large group.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They mourned loudly for a long time at the threshing place at Atad east of the Jordan. Joseph performed mourning ceremonies for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The citizens of Canaan saw those people mourning at Atad. They said: »What a solemn ceremony of mourning the Egyptians are holding!« That is why the place was named Abel-mizraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jacobs sons did as he had commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They carried his body to Canaan and buried it in the cave at Machpelah east of Mamre. He was buried in the field Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite for a burial ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After the funeral, Joseph, his brothers, and everyone else returned to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After Jacob died, Josephs brothers said to each other: »What if Joseph still hates us and wants to get even with us for all the cruel things we did to him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus they sent word to Joseph, saying: »Your father gave us orders before his death. He said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»You are to say to Joseph: »Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you. If it is your pleasure, forgive the sin of the servants of your fathers God.« « Upon hearing these words Joseph was overcome with weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then his brothers also came and immediately bowed down in front of him. »We are your slaves!« they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Joseph replied to them: »Do not be afraid! I cannot take Gods place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Even though you planned evil against me, God planned good to come out of it. This was to keep many people alive, as he is doing now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»You have nothing to fear. I will take care of you and your children.« So he reassured them with kind words that touched their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Joseph continued to live in Egypt with his fathers family. He was a hundred and ten years old when he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Joseph lived long enough to see Ephraims children and grandchildren. He also lived to see the children of Manassehs son Machir. He welcomed them into his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Before Joseph died, he told his brothers: »I will not live much longer. God will take care of you. He will lead you out of Egypt to the land he promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Promise me that you will take my body with you when God leads you to that land.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Joseph died in Egypt at the age of one hundred and ten. His body was embalmed and put in a coffin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
