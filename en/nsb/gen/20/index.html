Later, while he was living in Gerar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>he said that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God appeared to the king in a dream and said: »You are going to die, because you have taken this woman. She is already married.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Abimelech had not come near her. He said: »Lord, I am innocent! Would you destroy my people and me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Abraham said that she was his sister. She said the same thing. I did this with a clear conscience. I have done no wrong!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God said to him in a dream: »Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience. In fact, I kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Give the mans wife back to him now. He is a prophet. He will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not give her back, you and all who belong to you are doomed to die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Abimelech got up early in the morning. He called all his servants and told them everything. The men were very afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abimelech called Abraham. He said to him: »What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you? You have brought a great sin on me and on my kingdom. You have done to me things that ought not to be done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Abimelech also asked Abraham: »What were you thinking when you did this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Abraham said: »I thought that because there are no people who reverence God in this place, I would be killed because of my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Besides, she is my sister. She is my fathers daughter, but not my mothers. She is also my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»When God had me leave my fathers home and travel around, I said to her: 'Do me a favor: Wherever we go, say that I am your brother.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Abimelech took sheep, cattle, and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham. He also gave his wife Sarah back to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Abimelech said: »Look, here is my land. Live anywhere you like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to Sarah: »Do not forget that I have given your brother twenty-five pounds of silver. This is to silence any criticism against you from everyone with you. You are completely cleared.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could have children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah had made it impossible for any woman in Abimelechs household to have children because of Abrahams wife Sarah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
