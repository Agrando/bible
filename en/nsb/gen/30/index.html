As a result, she became jealous of her sister and said to Jacob: »Give me children, or I will die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jacob became angry with Rachel. He said: »I cannot take the place of God. He is the one who keeps you from having children.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>She said: »Here is my maid Bilhah. Sleep with her, so that she can have a child for me. This way I can become a mother through her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah. Jacob slept with Bilhah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They had a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Rachel named him Dan, because she said: »God has answered my prayers. He has vindicated me and given me a son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Bilhah and Jacob had a second son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Rachel said: »I have struggled hard with my sister, and I have won!« So she named the boy Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Leah realized she could not have any more children, she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They had a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leah said: »How fortunate. She called him Gad.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Leahs slave Zilpah gave birth to her second son for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Leah said: »I am happy, for women will call me blessed. So she named him Asher.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>During the wheat harvest Reuben went out into the fields. He found some mandrake plants. He brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah: »Please, give me some of your sons mandrake plants.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Leah replied: »Is it not enough that you took my husband? Are you also going to take my sons mandrake plants?« Rachel responded: »Very well, Jacob can go to bed with you tonight in return for your sons mandrake plants.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jacob came in from the fields that evening. Leah went out to meet him. »You are to sleep with me,« she said. »You are my reward for my sons mandrake plants.« So he went to bed with her that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>God answered Leahs prayer. She became pregnant and gave birth to her fifth son for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Leah said: »God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave to my husband.« So she named him Issachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>She became pregnant again and gave birth to her sixth son for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Leah said: »God has presented me with a wonderful gift. This time my husband will honor me, because I have given him six sons.« So she named him Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Later she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then God remembered Rachel. God listened to her and opened her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So she conceived and gave birth to a son. She said: »God has taken away my reproach.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>She named him Joseph. She said: »May Jehovah give me another son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban: »Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you. Let me depart. For you know how much service I have done for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Laban said: »If now it pleases you, stay with me. I have observed that Jehovah has blessed me on your account.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He continued: »Name your wages, and I will pay.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jacob responded: »You know how much work I have done for you and what has happened to your livestock under my care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»The little that you had before I came has grown to a large amount. Jehovah has blessed you wherever I have been. When may I do something for my own family?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Laban asked: »What should I give you?« Jacob answered: »Do not give me anything. Instead, do something for me. Then I will go back to taking care of and watching your flocks again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Let me go through all of your flocks today and take every speckled and spotted sheep, every black lamb, and every spotted and speckled goat. They will be my wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»My honesty will speak for itself whenever you come to check on my wages. Any goat I have that is not speckled or spotted or any lamb that is not black will be considered stolen.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Laban answered: »I agree; we will do as you have said.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Laban took out the striped and spotted male goats, all the speckled and spotted female goats every one with white on it, and every black lamb. He had his sons take charge of them that same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They moved away from Jacob with this flock as far as he could travel in three days. Jacob took care of the rest of Labans flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jacob took green branches of poplar storax, almond, and plane trees and stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He placed these branches in front of the flocks at their drinking troughs. He put them there, because the animals mated when they came to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So when the goats bred in front of the branches, they produced young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jacob kept the sheep separate from the goats and made them face in the direction of the streaked and black animals of Labans flock. In this way he built up his own flock and kept it apart from Labans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When the strongest of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When the flock was feeble, he did not put them in. That way the feebler were Labans and the stronger Jacobs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
