They rebelled in the thirteenth year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the edge of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They turned back and came to En-mishpat Kadesh, and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Zoar went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They fought against King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar, four kings against five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen tar pits. As the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them. The rest fled to the hill country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food provisions, and went their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They also captured Lot, son of Abrams brother, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. He was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. They were Abrams allies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive. Abram led his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, in pursuit as far as Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He divided his forces against them by night. He and his servants routed them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he brought back all the goods.
