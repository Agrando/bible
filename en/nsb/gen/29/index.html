There were three flocks of sheep lying around it. The flocks were watered from this well. It had a large stone over the opening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When all the flocks came together there, the shepherds would roll the stone back and water them. Then they would put the stone back in place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jacob asked the shepherds: »Where are you from?« They answered: »We are from Haran.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then he asked: »Do you know Nahors grandson Laban?« »Yes, we do,« they replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jacob asked: »How is he?« They replied: »He is well. Here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»It is still the heat of the day. It is not time for livestock to be gathered. Would you like to water the sheep so they can get back to grazing?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They said: »We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her fathers sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jacob saw Rachel, daughter of his uncle Laban, with his uncle Labans sheep. He came forward and rolled the stone off the opening of the well and watered his uncle Labans sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept loudly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers nephew and that he was Rebekahs son. She ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As soon as Laban heard the news about his sisters son Jacob, he ran to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him into his home. Then Jacob told Laban all that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Laban said: »You are indeed my own flesh and blood.« Jacob stayed there a whole month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Laban said to Jacob: »You should not work for me for nothing just because you are my relative. How much pay do you want?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Laban had two daughters. The older was named Leah and the younger Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Leah had soft eyes and Rachel was shapely and very beautiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he said: »I will work seven years for you, if you will let me marry Rachel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Laban answered: »It is better that I give her to you than to anyone else. Stay here with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jacob worked seven years for Laban. The time seemed like only a few days, because he loved Rachel so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jacob said to Laban: »Give me my wife for the time is completed. I want to marry Rachel now!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Laban gathered all the men of the place and gave a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the evening when it was dark, he took Leah, his daughter, and gave her to him. Jacob slept with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Laban gave Zilpah, his servant-girl, to Leah, to be her maid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»What have you done to me?« Jacob asked Laban: »Did I work for you in return for Rachel? Why did you cheat me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Laban answered: »It is not our custom to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Finish the week of wedding festivities with this daughter. Then we will give you the other one too. But you will have to work for me another seven years.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jacob did that. He finished the week with Leah. Then Laban gave his daughter Rachel to him as his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Laban gave his slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jacob slept with Rachel too. He loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban another seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jehovah saw that Leah was loved less, so he made it possible for her to have children. But Rachel had none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, because she said: »Certainly, Jehovah has seen my misery. Now my husband will love me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: »Certainly, Jehovah has heard that I am unloved. He has also given me this son.« She named him Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: »Now at last my husband will become attached to me because I have given him three sons.« She named him Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: »This time I will praise Jehovah.« So she named him Judah Praise. Then she stopped having children.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
