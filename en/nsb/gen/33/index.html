Therefore he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two concubines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He put the concubines and their children first, then Leah and her children, and finally Rachel and Joseph at the rear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jacob went ahead of them. He bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Esau ran to meet him. He threw his arms around him, and kissed him. They both cried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Esau looked around and saw the women and the children. He asked: »Who are these people with you?« Jacob answered: »These are the children whom God has been good enough to give me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the concubines came up with their children and bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Leah and her children came next, and last of all Joseph and Rachel came and bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Esau asked: »What about that other group I met? What do you mean by all this company?« Jacob answered: »It was to gain your favor.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»But, brother, I already have plenty,« Esau replied. »Keep them for yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jacob said: »Please accept these gifts as a sign of your friendship for me. When you welcomed me and I saw your face, it was like seeing the face of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Take my offering then, with my blessing. God has been very good to me and I have enough.« So at his strong request, he took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Esau said: »Let us go on our journey together. I will go in front.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jacob responded: »My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds that are nursing are a care to me. If they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Please let my lord pass on before his servant. I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Esau said: »Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.« But he said: »What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jacob moved on to Succoth. He built a house there for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is named Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jacob traveled safely from Paddan-aram to the city of Shechem in Canaan. He camped within sight of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He bought the piece of land on which he pitched his tents. He bought it from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He set up an altar there and named it God, the God of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
