Lot was sitting there as they arrived. When he saw them, he got up to greet them. Then he welcomed them and bowed low to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»My lords,« he said, »come to my home to wash your feet, and be my guests for the night. You may get up in the morning as early as you like and be on your way again.« »Oh no,« they said, »We will spend the night out here in the city square.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lot insisted, so at last they went home with him. He set a great feast before them, complete with fresh unleavened unfermented bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They prepared to retire for the night when suddenly all the men of Sodom, young and old, came from all over the city and surrounded the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They shouted to Lot: »Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out so we can have sex with them!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Please, my brothers,« he begged, »do not do such a wicked thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I have two virgin daughters. Do with them as you wish, but leave these men alone, for they are under my protection.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Stand back!« they shouted. »Who do you think you are? We let you settle among us, and now you are trying to tell us what to do! We will treat you far worse than those other men!« They pushed Lot and began breaking down the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the two angels reached out and pulled Lot in and bolted the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they blinded the men of Sodom so they could not find the doorway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Do you have any other relatives here in the city?« The angels asked. »Get them out of this place, sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»We will destroy the city completely. The stench of the place has reached Jehovah. He has sent us to destroy it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Lot rushed out to tell his sons-in-law: »Hurry! Get out of the city! Jehovah is going to destroy it.« But the young men thought he was only joking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At dawn the next morning the angels became insistent. They said to Lot: »Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here. Get out of here right now, or you will be caught in the destruction of the city.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lot still hesitated. So the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety outside the city, for Jehovah was merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Run for your lives!« The angels warned. »Do not stop and do not look behind you! Escape to the mountains, or you will die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Oh no, my lords, please,« Lot begged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»You have been so kind to me and saved my life, and you have granted me such mercy. But I cannot go to the mountains. Disaster would catch up to me there, and I would soon die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»There is a small village nearby. Please let me go there instead. Do you see how small it is? Then my life will be saved.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The angel said to him: »All right, I will grant you this request too. I will not destroy the city you are talking about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Run there quickly! I cannot do anything until you get there." The city is named Zoar Small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sun had just risen over the land as Lot came to Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jehovah made burning sulfur and fire rain out of the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He destroyed those cities, the whole Plain, all who lived in the cities, and whatever grew on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lots wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Early the next morning Abraham came to the place where he had stood in front of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land in the Plain. He saw smoke rising from the land like the thick smoke of a furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot was living, he kept Abraham in mind and allowed Lot to escape to safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar. So he and his two daughters moved up into the hills and lived in a cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The older daughter said to her sister: »Our father is getting old. There are no men in the whole world to marry us so we can have children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Come, let us get our father drunk. Then we can sleep with him and have children by him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>That night they gave him wine to drink. The older daughter had intercourse with him. But he was so drunk that he did not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The next day the older daughter said to her sister: »I slept with him last night. Let us get him drunk again tonight, and you sleep with him. Then each of us will have a child by our father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So that night they got him drunk. The younger daughter had intercourse with him. Again he was so drunk that he did not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Both of Lots daughters became pregnant by their own father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The older daughter had a son, whom she named Moab. He was the ancestor of the present-day Moabites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The younger daughter also had a son, whom she named Ben-ammi. He was the ancestor of the present-day Ammonites.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
