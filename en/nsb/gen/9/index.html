He said: »Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»All the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air will be filled with fear and dread of you. Every creature that moves along the ground and all the fish of the sea are placed under your control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»You must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will require your lifeblood as an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. I will demand an accounting from each man for the life of his fellow man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Whoever sheds the blood of man will have his blood shed by man. For man was made in the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You should be fruitful and increase in number. Multiply increase on the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"and with every living creature that was with you, the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you, every living creature on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I establish my covenant with you: Never again will the waters of a flood destroy all life. Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>God said: »This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I give you my rainbow in the clouds. It will be the sign of my covenant with the world of mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I will remember my covenant with you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters flood to destroy all life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the long lasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>God said: »This is the sign of the covenant I have established with all life on the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Noahs sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Then they walked in backward and covered their fathers nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their fathers nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He Noah said: »Canaan is cursed! He will be a lowly slave to his brothers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He also said: »Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»May God extend the territory of Japheth. And may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After the flood, Noah lived three hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Noah lived a total of nine hundred and fifty years, and then he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
