He dreamed he was standing by the Nile River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Suddenly, seven nice-looking well-fed cows came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Seven other cows came up from the river behind them. These cows were sickly and skinny. They stood behind the first seven cows on the riverbank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The cows that were sickly and skinny ate the seven nice-looking well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He fell asleep again and had another dream. Seven heads of grain, full and ripe, were growing on one stalk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then seven other heads of grain sprouted thin and scorched by the desert wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The thin heads of grain swallowed the full ones. The king woke up and realized that he had been dreaming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The king was upset the next morning. So he called his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed. None of them could tell him what the dreams meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The kings chief cupbearer said: »Now I remember what I was supposed to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»When you were angry with your chief cook and me, you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»One night we both had dreams. Each dream had a different meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»A young Hebrew, who was a servant of the captain of the guard, was there with us at the time. When we told him our dreams, he explained what each of them meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Everything happened just as he said it would. I got my job back, and the cook was put to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the king sent for Joseph. He was quickly brought out of jail. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The king said: »I had a dream. No one can explain what it means. I am told that you can interpret dreams.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Joseph then answered Pharaoh: »I cannot do it myself, but God can give the meaning of your dreams.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The king told Joseph: »I dreamed as I stood on the bank of the Nile River,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river. They began feeding on the grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Next, seven skinny, bony cows came up out of the river. I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»The skinny cows ate the fat ones!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Even though they had eaten the fat cows, no one could tell they had eaten them. They looked just as sick as before. Then I woke up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»In my second dream I saw seven good, full heads of grain growing on a single stalk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Seven other heads of grain, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but no one could tell me what it meant.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Joseph said to Pharaoh: »Pharaoh had the same dream twice. God has told Pharaoh what he is going to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The seven good cows are seven years. The seven good heads of grain are seven years. It is all the same dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The seven thin, sickly cows that came up behind them are seven years. The seven empty heads of grain scorched by the east wind are also seven years. Seven years of famine are coming!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»It is just as I said to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is going to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Seven years are coming when there will be plenty of food in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Seven years of famine will follow. Then people will forget that there was plenty of food in Egypt. The famine will ruin the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»People will not remember that there was once plenty of food in the land, because the coming famine will be so severe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»The reason Pharaoh has had a recurring dream is because the matter has been definitely decided by God. He will do it very soon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Pharaoh should look for a wise and intelligent man and put him in charge of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Make arrangements to appoint supervisors over the land. Take a fifth of Egypts harvest during the seven good years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Have them collect all the food during these good years. Store up grain under Pharaohs control, to be kept for food in the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»This food will be a reserve supply for our country during the seven years of famine that will happen in Egypt. Then the land will not be ruined by the famine.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The king and his officials approved this plan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and he said to them: »We will never find a better man than Joseph. He is a man who has Gods Spirit in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The king said to Joseph: »God has shown you all this. Therefore it is obvious that you have greater wisdom and insight than anyone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»I will put you in charge of my country. All my people will obey your orders. Your authority will be second only to mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»I now appoint you governor over all Egypt.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Josephs hand. He clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He had him ride in his second chariot. They proclaimed before him: »Bow the knee!« Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph: »Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Pharaoh named Joseph, Zaphenath-paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>During the seven years of plenty the land produced abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He gathered all the food of these seven years that occurred in the land of Egypt and placed the food in the cities. He placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea. He finally stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Before the year of famine came, there were born to Joseph two sons, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Joseph named his firstborn son Manasseh, because God helped him forget all his troubles and all about his fathers family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He named the second son Ephraim, because God made him fruitful in the land where he had suffered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The seven years when there was plenty of food in Egypt came to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every other country, but there was food throughout Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When the Egyptians became hungry, they cried out to the king for food. So he ordered them to go to Joseph and do what he told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The famine grew worse and spread over the entire country. Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>People came to Egypt from all over the world to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
