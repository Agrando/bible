Your reward shall be very great.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Abram said: »O Jehovah God, what will you give me? I continue childless! The heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Abram also said: »You have given me no offspring. So a slave born in my house is to be my heir.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The word of Jehovah came to him: »This man shall not be your heir. No one but your very own issue shall be your heir.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He brought him outside and said: »Look toward heaven and count the stars. Are you able to count them?« He continued: »So shall your descendants be.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He believed in Jehovah. Jehovah considered Abrams faith as his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then God said to him: »I AM JEHOVAH, who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Abram replied: »O Jehovah God, how will I know that I shall possess it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He God said to him: »Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Abram brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other. He did not cut the birds in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah said to Abram: »Know this for sure; your offspring will be strangers aliens in a land that is not theirs. They will be slaves there, and they shall be oppressed for four hundred years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve! Afterward they will come out with great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»As for yourself, you shall go to your ancestors in peace. You shall be buried at a good old age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»They shall come back here in the fourth generation. The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The sun went down and it was dark. A smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram. He said: »To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
