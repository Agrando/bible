He said to him: »Abraham!« Abraham replied: »Here I am.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey. He took two of his servants and his son Isaac with him. He had cut the wood for the burnt offering. Then he set out for the place that God had told him about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Two days later Abraham saw the place in the distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He said to the servants: »Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there and worship. Then we will come back to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Abraham made Isaac carry the wood for the sacrifice. Abraham carried a knife and live coals for starting the fire. As they walked along together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Isaac spoke up: »Father!« He answered: »Yes, my son?« Isaac asked: »I see that you have the coals and the wood, but where is the lamb for the sacrifice?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Abraham answered: »God will provide one.« And the two of them walked on together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They came to the place God had told him about. Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. He tied up his son and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he picked up the knife to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovahs angel shouted from heaven: »Abraham! Abraham!« »Here I am!« he answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Do not hurt the boy or harm him in any way!« The angel said. »Now I know that you truly obey God, because you were willing to offer him your only son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in the bushes. So he took the ram and sacrificed it in place of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Abraham named that place »Jehovah Will Provide.« It is still said today: »It will be provided on the mountain of Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from heaven a second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said: »I am taking an oath on my own name, declares Jehovah, that because you have done this and have not refused to give me your son, your only son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I will certainly bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the grains of sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of their enemies cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»All the nations will ask me to bless them as I have blessed your descendants. This is because you obeyed my command.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Abraham and Isaac went back to the servants who had come with him. They returned to Abrahams home in Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Abrahams brother Nahor had married Milcah, and Abraham was later told that they had eight sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Uz was their firstborn. Buz was next. Then there was Kemuel who became the father of Aram. Their other five sons were</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These are the eight children Milcah bore to Nahor, Abrahams brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His concubine, Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
