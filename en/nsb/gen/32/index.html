I am sending you word in the hope of gaining your favor.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said: »We went to your brother Esau. He is already on his way to meet you. He has four hundred men with him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jacob was frightened and worried. He divided the people who were with him into two groups. He also divided his sheep, goats, cattle, and camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He thought: »If Esau comes and attacks the first group, the other may be able to escape.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jacob prayed: »O God of my father Abraham, the God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, you said to me: Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I am less than nothing in comparison with all your love and your faithfulness to me your servant. I only had a stick in my hand when I traveled across Jordan. Now I have become two armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Save me from the hand of Esau, my brother. I fear that he will attack me and kill both mothers and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»You said, I will make sure that you are prosperous and that your descendants will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. No one will be able to count them because there are so many.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jacob stayed there that night. Then he prepared a gift for his brother Esau from what he had brought with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There were two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred female sheep and twenty male sheep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>also thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He placed servants in charge of each herd. He said to his servants: »Go ahead of me, and maintain a distance between the herds.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He commanded the first servant: »When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and whose animals are these ahead of you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Say, They belong to your servant Jacob. This is a gift sent to you. Jacob is directly behind us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He also commanded the second servant, the third, and all the others who followed the herds. He said: »Say the same thing to Esau when you find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Be sure to say, Jacob is right behind us.« He thought: »I will make peace with him by giving him this gift that I am sending ahead of me. After that, I will see him, and he will welcome me back.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jacob sent the gift ahead of him, while he stayed in the camp that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That same night Jacob got up, took his two wives, his two concubines, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After he sent them across, he also sent across all that he owned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jacob was by himself. A man was fighting with him till dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob. He gave him a blow in the hollow part of his thigh, so that his leg was damaged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to him: »Let me go now, for the dawn is near.« But Jacob said: »I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he asked: »What is your name?« And he said, »Jacob.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The man said: »Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel He Struggles With God, because you have struggled with God and with menand you have won.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jacob said: »Please tell me your name.« The man answered: »Why do you ask for my name?« Then he blessed Jacob there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jacob named that place Peniel Face of God, because he said: »I have seen God face to face, yet my life was saved.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun rose as he passed Penuel. He was limping because of his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, even today the people of Israel do not eat the muscle of the thigh the sinew attached to the hip socket. This is because God touched the socket of Jacobs thigh at the muscle.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
