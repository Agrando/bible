Respond to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I brought you out of the land of Egypt. I redeemed you out of the house of bondage. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him.
