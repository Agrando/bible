The mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established above the top of the mountains. It will be exalted above the hills. Peoples will flow to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Many nations will come. They will say: »Come you people, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths!« For out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations far away. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks! Nation will not lift up sword against nation and they will not learn war any more!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Each man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree. No one will make them afraid! The mouth of Jehovah of Hosts has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All the nations walk every one in the name of their god. We will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»In that day,« said Jehovah, »I will assemble the lame, and I will gather the outcasts, and those I have afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I will make the lame a remnant and the outcast far off a strong nation. Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from now on and forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, it will come to you. The former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Why do you cry out aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished? Has pain taken hold of you like a woman in childbirth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in childbirth! For now you will go out of the city and dwell in the field. You will go to Babylon where you will be rescued. Jehovah will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Many nations are assembled against you! They say: Let her be defiled, and let us gloat over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»They do not know Jehovahs thoughts. Neither do they understand his counsel. He has gathered them like the sheaves of cut grain to the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion! I will make your horn like iron and I will make your hoofs like brass. You will pulverize many nations into pieces. I will devote their profit and wealth to Jehovah the Lord of the whole earth.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
