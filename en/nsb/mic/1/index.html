This is the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Hear, all you peoples! Listen, O earth, and all who are in it! Let the Sovereign Lord Jehovah be a witness against you, Jehovah from his Holy Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»For, behold, Jehovah comes out of his place! He comes down and treads upon the high places of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The mountains melt under him. The valleys split like wax before the fire! Like waters poured down a steep place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»This is because of the transgression of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not the idol worship of Samaria? What is Judahs high place? Is it not Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the field. It will be a place for planting vineyards. I will tumble down her stones into the valley! I will uncover her foundations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»All her images will be broken to pieces! All that she has earned will be burned with fire. I will destroy all her idols. She gathered them for the price of a prostitute and for the price of a prostitute they will return.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I Micah will lament and wail. I will go barefoot and naked. I will make a howling like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Samarias wound is incurable! It came as far as Judah. It even reached to the gate of my people, Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Do not announce it at Gath, Philistia. Do not weep or show grief. At the house of Ophrah house of dust roll in the dust!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame. The inhabitant of Zaanan has not come forth! The wailing of Bethezel takes away from you the place where it stands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, because bad came down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O lady inhabitant of Lachish! You were the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion. The transgressions of Israel were found in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Therefore you should give a parting gift to Micahs hometown Moresheth-gath. The houses of Achzib shall be a place of deceit to the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I will yet bring a conqueror against you, O inhabitant of Mareshah! He will possess you. The glory of Israel will come to Adullam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Make yourself bald. Cut off your hair for the children of your delight! Enlarge your baldness as the eagle. For your children are gone into exile captivity from you.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
