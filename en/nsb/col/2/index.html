I have the full assurance that only true understanding brings. In this way they will accurately know Gods secret, which is Christ himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In him is concealed all the hidden treasures of Gods wisdom and knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I tell you this: Do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments, no matter how good they seem to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit mental disposition. I am glad when I see the resolute firmness with which you stand together in your faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have accepted Christ Jesus as Lord. Now walk live in union with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Keep your roots deep in him! Build your lives on him. Become stronger in your faith, as you were taught, and be filled with thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>See to it that no one enslaves you by means of philosophy and worthless deceit of human wisdom according to tradition of men. It is according to the elementary principles of the world, and not from Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The fullness of divine nature lives in Christs bodily form.

He is the head over all government and authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You were also circumcised in him with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You have been buried with him in baptism. You were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He blotted out the bond written in ordinances. It was against us and was contrary to us. He has taken it out of the way. He nailed it to the stake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He disarmed the rulers and authorities! He made a public display of them triumphing over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let no man judge you in food or in drink or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are a shadow of the things to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man rob you of your prize by a self-abasement and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things that he has seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>not holding fast to the head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, grows with the growth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If you died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Do not handle. Do not taste. Do not touch.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These are the precepts and doctrines of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These have, indeed, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body.
