He also sent cedar logs, stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>David knew that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel.

Will you hand them over to me?« Jehovah answered him: »Go, I will hand them over to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>David and his men went to Baal Perazim. He defeated them there. He said: »As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand.« So that place was called Baal Perazim the lord who breaks out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Philistines abandoned their gods. So David gave orders to burn them in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Once more the Philistines raided the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David inquired of God again, and God answered him: »Do not go straight up, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle. That will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David did as God commanded him. They struck down the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus Davids fame spread throughout every land.
