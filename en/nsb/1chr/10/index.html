So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Saul, his three sons and his entire house died together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled.
