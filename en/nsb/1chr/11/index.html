They said: »Indeed we are your bone and your flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»In time past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in.« Jehovah your God said to you: »You will shepherd my people Israel, and be ruler over my people Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron. David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the presence of Jehovah. Then they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the inhabitants of Jebus said to David: »You shall not come in here!« Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion that is, the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>David said: Whoever attacks the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and became chief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then David dwelt in the stronghold. That is why they called it the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He built the city around it, from the stronghold on the mound to the surrounding area. Joab repaired the rest of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>David went on and became great, and Jehovah of Hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These were the men in charge of Davids mighty men. They strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the captains; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred, killed by him at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After him were Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was with David at Pasdammim. The Philistines were gathered for battle. There was a piece of ground full of barley. And the people fled from the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They stationed themselves in the middle of that field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. So Jehovah brought about a great victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam. The army of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David said with longing: »Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate. They took it to David. Nevertheless David would not drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said: »Far be it from me, O my God, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have placed their lives in jeopardy? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.« Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred men. He killed them and won a name among these three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Of the three he was more honored than the other two men. Therefore he became their captain. However he did not attain to the first three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He killed two lion-like heroes of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great height, seven and a half feet tall. Egyptian had a spear like a weavers beam in his hand. He went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and killed him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Indeed he was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. David appointed him over his guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Also the mighty warriors were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Sibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shageh the Hararite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite a chief of the Reubenites and thirty with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Hanan the son of Maachah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
