They were to do the same in the evening</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and whenever burnt offerings were presented to Jehovah on Sabbaths and at New Moon festivals and at appointed feasts. They were to serve before Jehovah regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the Temple of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
