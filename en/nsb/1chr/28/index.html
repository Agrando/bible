I had my heart set on building the Temple where the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant could be placed. This Temple will be a stool for our Gods feet, and I have made preparations to build it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»However God told me: You must not build the Temple for my name because you have fought wars and caused bloodshed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Yet, from my entire family Jehovah God of Israel chose me to be king of Israel for as long as I live. He had chosen the tribe of Judah to lead Israel. From the families of Judah he chose my fathers family. From among my fathers sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Of all my sons, for Jehovah has given me many sons, he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of Jehovahs kingdom to rule Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»He told me: Your son Solomon will build my Temple and my courtyards because I have chosen him to be my son. I will be his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I will establish his kingdom for a very long time if he will remain determined to obey my commands and laws, as he is doing today.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I order you in the sight of Israel, Jehovahs congregation. And as our God listens dedicate your lives to doing everything Jehovah your God has commanded. Then you will be able to possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance for your descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»You my son Solomon, learn to know your fathers God. Serve Jehovah wholeheartedly and willingly because he searches every heart and understands every thought we have. If you dedicate your life to serving him, he will accept you. On the other hand if you abandon him, he will reject you from then on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»So be careful, because Jehovah has chosen you to build the Temple as his holy place. Be strong, and do it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the entrance hall and the Temple, the storerooms, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the throne of mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He gave him plans for the courtyards of Jehovahs Temple and for all the rooms around it. These rooms served as treasuries for Gods Temple and the gifts dedicated to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He determined the divisions of the priests and Levites. He planned all the work done for worship in Jehovahs Temple. He designed all the utensils for worship in Jehovahs Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David specified the weight of gold to be used for each of the utensils for worship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>the weight of the gold lamp stands and their gold lamps that is, the weight of gold for each lamp stand and its lamps, the weight of silver for each silver lamp stand and its lamps according to the use of each lamp stand for worship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the weight of gold for each table with the rows of bread, and the silver for the silver tables,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the pure gold for the forks, bowls, and pitchers, the weight of each gold bowl, the weight of each silver bowl,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave Solomon the plans for the chariot, that is, the gold angels with their wings spread to cover the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>David said: »All this was written for me by Jehovahs hand. He made all the details of the plan clear to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>David also told his son Solomon: Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do no be afraid or terrified. Jehovah God, my God, will be with you. He will not abandon you until all the work on Jehovahs Temple is finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Here are the divisions of the priests and Levites for every type of worship in Gods Temple. You have with you every skilled worker to do the work. In addition, all the leaders and people are at your command.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
