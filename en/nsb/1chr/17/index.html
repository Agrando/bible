He said to Nathan the prophet: »Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah is under a tent.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Nathan replied to David: »Do what you have in mind, for God is with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That night God spoke to Nathan. He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Go tell my servant David, This is what Jehovah says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»In all the places where I have moved with the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, tell my servant David: »This is what Jehovah of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I have been with you wherever you have gone. I have destroyed all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»They have done this since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. I declare to you that Jehovah will build a house for you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you. It will be one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»He is the one who will build a house for me. I will establish his throne forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever! His throne will be established forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then King David went in and sat in Jehovahs presence. He said: »Who am I, O Jehovah? What is my family, that you have brought me this far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»If this were not enough in your sight, O God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men, O Jehovah my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Jehovah. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»There is no one like you Jehovah and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Who is like your people Israel? Israel is the one nation on earth whos God went out to redeem a people. You redeemed your people from Egypt. You make a name for yourself, and perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»You made your people Israel your very own for a very long time, and you, O Jehovah, have become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Now, Jehovah, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established from generation to generation. Do as you promised!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»It will be established and your name will be great forever. Then men will say: »Jehovah of Hosts, the God over Israel, is Israels God! And the house of your servant David will be established before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»O JEHOVAH, YOU ARE GOD! You have promised these good things to your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You have been pleased to bless the house of your servant that it may continue for a very long time in your sight. You Jehovah have blessed it and it will be blessed from generation to generation.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
