They presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in Gods presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When David finished sacrificing burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He also distributed to every person in Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David appointed some Levites to serve in front of Jehovahs Ark by offering prayers, thanks, and praise to Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Asaph was the head. Zechariah was second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel with harps and lyres. Asaph played the cymbals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The priests Benaiah and Jahaziel played trumpets all the time in front of the Ark of Gods covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the first time David entrusted Asaph and his relatives with the task of singing songs of thanks to Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Give thanks to Jehovah. Call on his name. Make known among the nations what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Sing to him. Make music to praise him. Meditate on all the miracles he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Praise his holy name. Let the hearts of those who seek Jehovah rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Search for Jehovah and his strength. Always seek his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Remember the miracles he performed. And remember the amazing things he did and the judgments he pronounced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You are descendants of Israel, his servant. You are descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>HE IS JEHOVAH OUR GOD. His judgments are pronounced throughout the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Remember his promise for a very long time, the word that he commanded for a thousand generations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Remember the covenant that he made to Abraham, and his sworn promise to Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He confirmed it as a law for Jacob, as a long lasting covenant to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said: »I will give you Canaan. It is your share of the inheritance.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While they were few in number a small group of foreigners lived in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They wandered from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He did not permit anyone to oppress them. He warned kings about them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Do not touch my anointed ones or harm my prophets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sing to Jehovah, all the earth! Day after day announce that Jehovah saves his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Tell people about his glory! Tell all the nations about his miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>JEHOVAH IS GREAT! He should be highly praised. He should be reverenced held in awerespected more than all other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This is because all the gods of the nations are useless idols while Jehovah created the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Splendor and majesty are in his presence. Strength and joy are where he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Appreciate Jehovahs glory and power you families of the nations. Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Ascribe to Jehovah the glory his name deserves. Bring an offering, and come to him.

It cannot be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad. Say to the nations: »JEHOVAH RULES AS KING!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the sea and everything in it roar like thunder. Let the fields and everything in them rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the trees in the forest will sing with joy in the presence of Jehovah when he comes to judge the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Give thanks to Jehovah because he is good, because his mercy endures forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Say: »Rescue us, O God our Salvation. Gather us and save us from the nations that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thanks be to Jehovah, God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Then all the people said »amen« and praised Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David left Asaph and his relatives to serve continually in front of the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant, as the daily work required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>David also left Obed Edom and sixty-eight of his relatives to serve there. Obed Edom Jeduthuns son and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>David left Zadok and his priestly relatives to serve in Jehovahs Tent at the place of worship in Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They were ordered to sacrifice burnt offerings to Jehovah. This happened on the altar of burnt offerings continually, morning and evening, as written in the Law of Jehovah that he gave Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>With Zadok and his relatives were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of the Levites who had been selected. They were chosen by name, to give thanks to Jehovah by singing, because His mercy endures forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Also, Heman and Jeduthun played trumpets, cymbals, and the other musical instruments that accompany sacred songs. Jeduthuns sons were stationed at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then all the people went home. David went back to bless his family.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
