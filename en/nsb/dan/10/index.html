Daniels name was also Belteshazzar. The matter was true. There was a great military movement. He understood the matter. He also understood the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I ate no pleasant bread; neither flesh nor wine entered my mouth. I did not anoint myself at all until three whole weeks were completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I was on the shore of the great river, Hiddekel Tigris River on the twenty-fourth day of the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I looked up to see a man clothed in linen. His loins were girded with pure gold of the Uphaz region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>His body also was like chrysolite and his face as the appearance of lightning. His eyes were like flaming torches and his arms and his feet like burnished copper. The sound of his words was like the sound of a crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I, Daniel, saw the vision alone, for the men that were with me did not see the vision. A great quaking fell upon them and they ran away to hide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me. My appearance turned deathlike pallorlividpale and I had no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yet I heard the sound of his words. When I heard the sound of his words I fell with my face toward the ground into a deep sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A hand touched me and set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to me: »O Daniel, you are greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you. Stand upright for I have been sent to you.« When he spoke these words I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he said: »Do not fear Daniel! From the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come in response to your prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me twenty-one days but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the future for the vision is yet for many days.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When he spoke these words to me I looked to the ground and was unable to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then one who looked like a human touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and spoke to him: »O my lord, by reason of the vision I have convulsions and I have no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»For how can the servant of my lord talk? I had no strength in me. I was also without breath.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the one with the human appearance touched me and he strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said, »O man greatly beloved, do not fear, peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong.« And when he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, »Let my lord speak for you have strengthened me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he said: »Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. The prince of Greece will also come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»But I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. There is no one standing firmly with me against these, but Michael your prince.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
