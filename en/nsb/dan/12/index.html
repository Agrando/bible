He is the great prince who stands for the children of your people. There will be a time of trouble that has not happened since the beginning of nations. Then your people will be delivered, every one whos name is found written in the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Those who have wisdom insight will shine like the brightness of the firmament. They turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»But you, O Daniel, keep the words secret, and seal the book until the time of the end.
