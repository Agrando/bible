He wrote the summery of the dream that came to his mind while he was in bed. It was the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Daniel said: »I saw in my vision by night, the four winds of heaven blew upon the great sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The first was like a LION. It had eagle's wings. I watched till the wings were pulled off. It was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon two feet like a man. A man's heart and mind was given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Look, a second beast, like a BEAR. It was raised up on one side. Three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. They said to it, Arise and devour much flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I saw another beast. It was like a LEOPARD. It had four wings as a bird on its back. The beast also had four heads. Dominion ruling authority was given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»After this I saw more visions in the night. I saw a FOURTH BEAST terrible and powerful, and exceedingly strong! It had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from the beasts that came before it. It had ten horns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I looked at the horns and another one, a little horn came. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man. It had a mouth that spoke great domineeringboastful things. The three first horns were plucked up roots and all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I watched as thrones were placed. The ANCIENT OF DAYS sat on one throne. His clothing was white as snow. His hair was like pure wool. His throne was like fiery flames, and the wheels on it were like burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»A fiery stream issued from before him. Thousands of thousands ministered to him. Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The judgment was set and the books were opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I paid attention because of the sound of the great boastful words the horn spoke. I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed. It was burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The dominion authority was taken away from the other beasts. Yet their lives were prolonged for a season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I saw in the night-visions someone like a SON OF MAN came with the clouds of heaven. He came to the Ancient of Days. They brought him near before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He was given legal power and a kingdom. Out of his glory all the peoples, nations, and languages will serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away. His kingdom will not be destroyed. (Revelation 11:15) (Daniel 2:44) (Psalm 45:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I, Daniel, was grieved to the center of my being, and the visions in my head troubled me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I came near to one of them that stood nearby, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me. HE MADE ME KNOW THE INTERPRETATION OF EVERYTHING.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»These FOUR GREAT BEASTS, ARE FOUR KINGS, that arise out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom. They will possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast that was different from the others. This beast was exceeding terrible. It had teeth made of iron. Its claws were made of copper. It devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»There were ten horns on its head. Three horns fell and another horn came up. The horn that had eyes and a mouth spoke great domineeringboastful things. Its appearance was greater than the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I watched that same horn as it made war with the holy ones. It prevailed against defeated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Then the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High, and the time came that the holy ones possessed the kingdom. (Revelation 5:10; Revelation 20:4; Revelation 20:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»He said: The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on earth. It will be different from all other kingdoms. It will devour the entire earth. It will trample it down and break it in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»The ten horns are ten kings that will arise out of this kingdom! Another will arise after them. He will be different from the former, and he will subdue three kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»He will speak words against the Most High Supreme God and wear down afflictcause great distress the holy ones of the Most High. He will think to change the times and law and will have control until a time and times and half a time. Three and one-half years</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»But the judgment shall be set applied and they will take away his power forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people who are the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom! All dominions legal authorities will serve and obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»This is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were very troubled. My appearance was changed. I kept the matter in my heart.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
