He set it up in the plain of Dura, the province of Babylon. It was ninety feet tall and nine feet wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king gathered the satraps, deputies, governors, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces. They came to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The satraps, deputies, governors, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together at the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up. They stood before the image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the herald proclaimed: »You are commanded to do this, O peoples, nations, and men of every language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Some Chaldean Astrologers brought accusation against the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, »O king, may you live for a very long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»You, O king, made a decree, that every man that hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Whoever does not fall down and worship, will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The Jews whom you appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego have not listened to you. They do not serve your gods. They do not worship the golden image that you set up.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. They brought these men before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nebuchadnezzar said to them: »Is it true Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that you do not serve my god, nor worship the golden image that I set up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, good! But if you do not worship it you will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace that same hour. What god will be able to rescue you from my hand?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king: »O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»If it is so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace. He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»If not you should know O king that we will not serve your gods. We will not worship the golden image that you set up!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nebuchadnezzar was furious. The expression on his face changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than its required heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He commanded the mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw them into the blazing furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then these men were bound in their coats, caps and their other garments. They were thrown into the midst of the blazing furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because of the urgency of the king's commandment and the exceeding hot furnace, the flame of the fire killed the men who delivered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the blazing furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished. He hurried to speak to his counselors: / »Did we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?« They answered: »True O king.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said: »Look, I see four men walking in the midst of the fire. They are not hurt! The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning blazing furnace. He called out: »Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God come here!« Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The satraps, deputies, governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men. They saw that the fire had no power upon their bodies. Not a single hair on their head was singed. Neither were their clothes changed and they did not smell like fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nebuchadnezzar said: »Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They violated the king's command and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut into pieces. Their houses shall be made a dunghill. There is no other god that is able to deliver like this.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
