Then it can assist those who are actually widows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the scripture said: »You must not muzzle the bull while he is threshing. The workman is worthy of his wages.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not offer an accusation against an elder, except at the mouth of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reprove the sinner in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these principles without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do not lay your hands hastily on any man, neither be a partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your many infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some men's sins are known publicly, leading to judgment; and some mens sin becomes known later.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner some good works are known publicly, and other works will be known, for they cannot be kept hidden.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
