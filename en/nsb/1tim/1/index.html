These myths false storiesfabrications and genealogies stimulate questions and speculation. They do not enhance the administration of God that is by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the objective is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Some have turned aside to vain talk by deviating from these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They want to be teachers of the Law even though they do not know what they are talking about. They do not understand what they say or what they confidently affirm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But we know that the Law is good, if a man uses it legitimately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Knowing this, that Law is not made for a righteous person. It is for the lawless and unruly, the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, and for manslayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It is for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and everything else that is contrary to the sound teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sound teaching doctrine is according to the good news of the glory of the blessed happy God. This was committed to my trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I thank him that enabled me and counted me faithful, appointing me to his service, Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a violent aggressor. I was shown mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this I obtained mercy, which in me as the foremost sinner Jesus Christ might show his long-suffering. This is for an example to those who should later believe in him for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I entrust this command to you, Timothy, my son. It is in accordance with the prophecies that were previously made. They do apply to you, and with them you may fight the good fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Keep the faith and maintain a good conscience! Some have rejected these things and have suffered shipwreck to their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I handed them over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
