The ceiling was of cedar, extending over storerooms, which were supported by the pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>On each of the two sidewalls there were three rows of windows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All the doors and doorframes were rectangular. There were three doors facing each other on opposite sides of the palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Solomon made the Hall of Pillars seventy-five feet long and forty-five feet wide. In front of the hall was an entrance hall with pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He made the hall for the throne. It was a place where he could sit on his throne and judge. The hall was covered with cedar from floor to ceiling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>His own private quarters were in a different location than the hall containing the throne. They were similar in design. Solomon also built private quarters like this for his wife, Pharaoh's daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>From the foundation to the roof, all these buildings, including the large courtyard, were built with high-grade stone blocks. The stone blocks were cut to size and trimmed with saws on their inner and outer faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The foundation was made with large, high-grade expensive stones. Some were twelve feet and others fifteen feet long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Above the foundation were cedar beams and high-grade expensive stone blocks, which were cut to size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The large courtyard had three layers of cut stone blocks and a layer of cedar beams, like the inner courtyard of Jehovahs Temple and the entrance hall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>King Solomon sent for a man named Huram, a craftsman living in the city of Tyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Huram was knowledgeable and skilled in making things out of copper. He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali. His father had been from Tyre. He went to do all of King Solomons work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Huram cast two copper columns. Each one was twenty-seven feet tall and eighteen feet in circumference. They were placed at the entrance of the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He also made two copper crowns. Each one was seven and one half feet tall. They were to be placed on top of the columns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The top of each column was decorated with a design of interwoven chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They had two rows of copper pomegranates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The crowns on the top of the columns were shaped like lilies, six feet tall,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and were placed on a rounded section which was above the chain design. There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows around each crown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Huram placed these two copper columns in front of the entrance of the Temple. The column on the south side was named Jachin and the one on the north was named Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The lily-shaped copper crowns were on top of the columns. The work on the columns was completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Hiram made a round tank of copper, seven and one half feet deep, fifteen feet in diameter, and forty-five feet in circumference.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of copper gourds. They were all cast in one piece with the rest of the tank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The tank rested on the backs of twelve copper bulls that faced outward. Three faced in each direction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The sides of the tank were three inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup. It curved outward like the petals of a lily. The tank held about ten thousand gallons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Huram also made ten copper carts. Each cart was six feet long, six feet wide, and four and one half feet high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They were made of square panels set in frames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There were figures of lions, bulls, and cherubim on the panels. And there were spiral relief figures on the frames above and underneath the lions and bulls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Each cart had four copper wheels with copper axles. At the four corners were copper supports for a basin. The supports were decorated with spiral relief figures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>There was a circular frame on top for the basin. It projected eighteen inches upward from the top of the cart and seven inches down into it. It had carvings around it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wheels were under the panels. They were twenty-five inches high. The axles were of one piece with the carts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The wheels were like chariot wheels. Their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of copper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There were four supports at the bottom corners of each cart. They were of one piece with the cart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There was a nine-inch band around the top of each cart. Its supports and the panels were of one piece with the cart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The supports and panels were decorated with figures of cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was space for them, with spiral figures all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is how the carts were made. They were all alike, having the same size and shape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Huram made ten basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet in diameter and held two hundred gallons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He placed five of the carts on the south side of the Temple. The other five were placed on the north side. The tank was placed at the southeast corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Huram made the pots and spades and the basins. Huram finished all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The two pillars and the two cups of the crowns which were on the tops of the two pillars; and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The four hundred apples for the network, two lines of apples for every network, covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The ten bases, with the ten washing-vessels on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The great water-vessel molten seacopper sea, with the twelve oxen under it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the pots and the spades and the basins; all the vessels which Huram made for King Solomon, for the house of Jehovah, were of polished brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He made them of liquid metal in the lowland district of the Jordan River. This was at the river crossing at Adama, between Succoth and Zarethan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Solomon did not weigh all the utensils because so much copper was used. No one tried to determine how much the copper weighed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Solomon made all the furnishings for Jehovahs Temple: the gold altar, the gold table on which the bread of the presence was placed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>lamps stands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north in front of the inner room, flowers, lamps, gold tongs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>dishes, snuffers, bowls, saucers, incense burners of pure gold, the gold sockets for the doors of the inner room the Most Holy Place, and the doors of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>All the work King Solomon did on Jehovahs Temple was finished. He brought the holy things that belonged to his father David: the silver, gold, and utensils and put them in the storerooms of Jehovahs Temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
