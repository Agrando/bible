He called his son Solomon and gave him his last instructions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»It is my time to die. I go the way of all people of the earth. Be strong and be a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Do what Jehovah your God orders you to do. Obey all his laws and commands, as written in the Law of Moses. That way wherever you go you may prosper in everything you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»If you obey Jehovah he will keep the promise he made when he told me, Your descendants will rule Israel as long as they are careful to obey my commands faithfully with all their heart and being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Remember what Joab did to me by killing the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. You remember how he murdered them in time of peace. This was revenge for deaths they had caused in time of war. He killed innocent men. I bear the responsibility for what he did. I suffer the consequences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You know what to do. You must not let him die a natural death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead and take care of them. They were kind to me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"There is also Shimei son of Gera, from the town of Bahurim in Benjamin. He cursed me with a bitter curse the day I went to Mahanaim. When he met me at the Jordan River, I gave him my solemn promise in the name of Jehovah, saying, I will not have you killed by the sword.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»However you must not let him go unpunished. You know what to do. You must make sure he is put to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>David died and was buried in David's City.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He was king of Israel for forty years. He ruled seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Solomon succeeded his father David as king. His royal power was firmly established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Adonijah, son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. »Is this a friendly visit?« She asked. »Yes,« he answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have something to discuss with you. He said. What is it? She asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said: »You know the kingship was mine. All Israel expected me to be their king. But the kingship has been turned over to my brother because Jehovah gave it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I have one request to make to you. Do not say no to me.« She responded: »Tell me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said: »Will you go to Solomon the king for he will not say No to you. And make my request that he give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Bathsheba said: »Indeed, I will make your request to the king.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him for Adonijah. The king stood up to meet her and bowed down to her. He took his place on the king's throne and she sat at his right hand on the seat made ready for the king's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then she said: »I have one small request to make of you. Do not say No to me.« The king replied: »Speak mother for I will not say no to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>She said: »Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother for a wife.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then King Solomon answered: »Why are you requesting me to give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah? Take the kingdom for him in addition, for he is my older brother, and Abiathar the priest and Joab, the son of Zeruiah, are on his side.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>King Solomon took an oath by Jehovah, saying: »May God's punishment be on me if Adonijah does not give payment for these words with his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Now by the living God Jehovah who has given me my throne from David my father. He made me one of a line of kings. He gave me his word. Adonijah will be put to death this day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>King Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada to attack and kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The king spoke to Abiathar the priest: »Go to your fields at Anathoth. You deserve death. But I will not put you to death now, because you carried the Ark of Jehovah God before David my father. You were with him in all his troubles.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Solomon did not allow Abiathar to be priest any longer. So the word of Jehovah came true concerning the sons of Eli in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Joab received news of this for Joab had been one of Adonijah's supporters. He was not on Absalom's side. Then Joab went in flight to the Tent of Jehovah and put his hands on the corners of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When King Solomon heard about this he sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Benaiah went to the Tent of Jehovah and told Joab: Come out. Joab said: »No! Let me die here.« So Benaiah returned to the king and gave him the answer Joab gave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The king said: »Do as he said. Kill him there and bury him in the earth. This will remove the guilt of his senseless murders from my fathers family and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Jehovah will punish Joab for those murders he committed without my father David's knowledge. Joab killed two innocent men who were better men than he: Abner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa, commander of the army of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Jehovah will repay him for the blood Joab shed. The blood will fall on Joab and on his descendants as long as they live. Jehovah will always give success to David's descendants who sit on his throne.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Benaiah went to the Tent of Jehovahs presence and killed Joab. He was buried at his home in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The king made Benaiah commander of the army in Joab's place and put Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The king sent for Shimei and said to him: »Build a house for yourself here in Jerusalem. Live in it and do not leave the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»If you ever leave and go beyond Kidron Brook, you will die and it will be your fault.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»As you say, Your Majesty,« Shimei answered. »I will do what you say.« So he lived in Jerusalem a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Three years later, however, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to the king of Gath, Achish son of Maacah. When Shimei heard that they were in Gath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>he saddled his donkey and went to King Achish in Gath, to find his slaves. He found them and brought them back home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When Solomon heard what Shimei did,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>he sent for him and said: »I made you promise in Jehovahs name not to leave Jerusalem. I warned you that if you ever did, you would die. Did you not agree to it and say that you would obey me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»Why did you break your promise and disobey my command?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»You know very well all the wrong that you did to my father David. Jehovah will punish you for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»But he will bless me, and he will make David's kingdom secure forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The king gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada. He killed Shimei. Solomon was now in complete control.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
