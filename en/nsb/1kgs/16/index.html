You have gone the way of Jeroboam. You made my people Israel do evil, moving me to wrath by their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Truly, I will take away the family of Baasha. I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Dogs will eat anyone of the family of Baasha who dies in town. The birds of the air will eat anyone who dies in the open country.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his power, are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Baasha rested with his fathers. He was buried at Tirzah; and Elah his son became king in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The word of Jehovah came to the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani. This was a warning against Baasha and his family because of all the evil he did in the eyes of Jehovah. He made Jehovah angry by the work of his hands, because he was like the family of Jeroboam, and because he killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In the twenty-sixth year that Asa was king of Judah, Elah, the son of Baasha, became king of Israel in Tirzah. He was king for two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>His servant Zimri, commander of half his war-carriages made plans to kill him. He was in Tirzah, drinking hard at the house of Arza, controller of the king's house in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Zimri attacked and killed him. It was the twenty-seventh year that Asa was king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Immediately after he became king and took his place on the throne of the kingdom, he put to death all the family of Baasha. Not one male child survived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Zimri destroyed the entire family of Baasha as Jehovah promised through the prophet Jehu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This happened because of the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, and because of all the sins they led Israel to commit. It aroused the anger of Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The rest of the acts of Elah are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, Zimri was king for seven days in Tirzah. The people were attacking Gibbethon in the land of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Israelites in the camp heard it said: »Zimri plotted against the king and killed him.« So all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king that day there in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Omri went up from Gibbethon, with all the army of Israel, and they attacked Tirzah, Israels capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Zimri saw that the city had fallen. So he went into the palace's inner fortress and set the palace on fire. He died in the flames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This happened because of his sins against Jehovah. Like his predecessor Jeroboam, he displeased Jehovah by his own sins and by leading Israel into sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Everything else that Zimri did, including the account of his conspiracy, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the army of Israel was divided into two factions. Half of the army followed Tibni, son of Ginath, and wanted to make him king. The other half followed Omri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the half that followed Omri was stronger than the half that followed Tibni, Ginath's son. Tibni died and Omri became king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Omri began to rule Israel in Asa's thirty-first year as king of Judah. He ruled for twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Omri bought a hill from Shemer for one hundred and fifty pounds of silver. He fortified the hill and built the city of Samaria on it. He named the city after its former owner, Shemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Omri did what Jehovah considered evil. He did more evil things than all the kings before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He lived exactly like Jeroboam, Nebat's son. He sinned and led Israel to sin with worthless idols. The Israelites made Jehovah the God of Israel furious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Everything else about Omri is written in the official records of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Omri rested with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria. Ahab his son became king in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the thirty-eighth year that Asa was king of Judah, Ahab, the son of Omri, became king over Israel. Ahab was king in Samaria for twenty-two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Ahab, the son of Omri, did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, even worse than all who went before him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It was as if he copied the evil ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. He took as his wife Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Zidon, and became a servant and worshipper of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He built an altar for Baal in the house of Baal that he built in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ahab made an image of Asherah. He did more than all the kings of Israel before him to make Jehovah, the God of Israel, angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>In his days Hiel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundation at the price of Abiram, his oldest son, and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son Segub. This was according to the word of Jehovah spoken through Joshua, the son of Nun.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
