They will take everything they consider valuable. They will be there about this time tomorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the king of Israel sent for all the responsible men of the land, and said: »Now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man. He sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, and I did not keep them back.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the responsible men and the people said to him: »Do not pay attention to him or do what he says.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he said to the representatives of Benhadad: »Say to my lord the king: All the orders you sent the first time I will do. But I will not do this thing.« The representatives went back with this answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Benhadad sent Ahab the following message: »May the gods strike me dead if there will be enough dust left from Samaria to give a handful to each soldier who follows me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The king of Israel responded: »It is said, let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Benhadad heard this when he and his allies were drinking in their tents. He told his officers to get ready. So they got prepared to attack the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said: »This is what Jehovah says: Have you seen this large army? I will hand it over to you today. Then you will know that I am Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ahab asked: »How will this be done?« The prophet answered: »This is what Jehovah says: By using the young officers of the district governors.« »Who will start the battle?« Ahab asked. »You will,« the prophet answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ahab mustered the young officers of the district governors. There were two hundred and thirty-two. After counting them, he counted all the Israelite soldiers. There were seven thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the middle of the day they went out. But Benhadad was drinking in the tents with the thirty-two kings who were helping him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The servants of the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land went forward first. Benhadad sent out a patrol and they told him: »Men have come out from Samaria.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said: »If they have come out for peace, take them alive and if they have come out for war, take them alive.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town, with the army following them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Each one killed his opponent. The Syrians Aramaeans went in flight with Israel after them. Benhadad the king of Aram got away safely on a horse with his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The king of Israel took the horses and the war-carriages and caused great destruction among the Syrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the prophet came up to the king of Israel, and said: »Now make yourself strong. Be careful what you do. Otherwise a year from now the king of Aram will come up against you again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the king of Aram's servants said to him: »Their god is a god of the hills. That is why they were stronger than us. If we attack them in the lowlands, we will certainly be stronger than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»This is what you must do: take the kings from their positions, and put captains in their places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Assemble another army like the one that was destroyed. Horse for horse, and carriage for carriage let us make war on them in the lowlands, and certainly we will be stronger than they.« He listened and did what was suggested.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So, a year later, Benhadad got the Syrians Aramaeans together and went to Aphek to make war on Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the children of Israel assembled, and food was made ready and they went against them. The children of Israel camped like two little flocks of goats before them. All the country was full of the Syrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A man of God came to the king of Israel. He said: »Jehovah says, Because the Aramaeans have said, »Jehovah is a god of the hills and not of the valleys; I will give all this great army into your hands, and you will see that I am Jehovah.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days. The seventh day the fight was started. The children of Israel put to the sword a hundred thousand Aramaean footmen in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The rest went in flight to Aphek, into the town, where a wall came down on the twenty-seven thousand who were still living. Benhadad went in flight into the town, into an inner room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>His servants said to him: »It is said that the kings of Israel are full of mercy: let us then put on haircloth, and cords on our heads, and go to the king of Israel. Maybe he will give you your life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they put on haircloth, and cords on their heads, and went to the king of Israel and said: »Your servant Benhadad says: Let me now keep my life.« And he said: »Is he still living? He is my brother.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the men took it as a sign, and were quick to pick up on his word. They said: »Benhadad is your brother.« Then he said: »Go and get him.« So Ben-hadad came out to him and he made him get up into his carriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Benhadad said: »The towns my father took from your father I will give back. You may name streets for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria.« As for me, at the price of this agreement you will let me go. So he made an agreement with him and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbors by the word of Jehovah: »Give me a wound.« But the man would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he said: »Because you have not listened to the voice of Jehovah, immediately after you leave me a lion will kill you.« When he went away a lion came rushing at him and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he came across another man, and said: »Give me a wound.« And the man gave him a blow wounding him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So the prophet went away, and pulling his headband over his eyes to keep his face covered. He took his place by the road waiting for the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When the king went by he cried out to him: »Your servant went out into the fight. A man came to me. He brought a man to me and said: guard this man. Do not let him get away. Your life is the price of his life or you will have to give a talent of silver in payment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»But while your servant was turning this way and that, he was gone. Then the king of Israel said to him: You are responsible; you have given the decision against yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He quickly took the headband from his eyes. The king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He said to him: »These are the words of Jehovah: Because you have let go from your hands the man whom I had put to the curse, your life will be taken for his life, and your people for his people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the king of Israel went back to his house, bitter and angry, he went to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
