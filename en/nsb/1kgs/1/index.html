They put covers over him but he could not get warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>His servants said to him: »Your Majesty let us find a young woman to stay with you and take care of you. She will lie close to you and keep you warm.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They searched all over Israel for a beautiful young woman, and in Shunem they found such a woman named Abishag, and brought her to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>She was very beautiful. She waited on the king and took care of him. However, he did not have intercourse with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Adonijah, son of Haggith, was very handsome. His mother gave birth to him after Maacah had Absalom. Adonijah boasted about himself, saying, »I will be king.« He got a chariot and horses and fifty men to run ahead of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>His father never confronted him by asking: »Why have you done this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Adonijah had discussed his actions with Joab son of Zeruiah and with the priest Abiathar, so they supported him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the priest Zadok, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the prophet Nathan, Shimei, Rei, and David's thirty special guards did not join Adonijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened calves at Zoheleth Rock near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's other sons, all the men of Judah, and the king's officials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But he did not invite the prophet Nathan, Benaiah, the special guard or his brother Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Nathan asked Solomon's mother Bathsheba: »Have you heard that Adonijah, Haggith's son, has become king, and our master David does not even know about it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Bathsheba, let me give you some advice about how to save your life and your son's life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Go now to King David and ask him: Your Majesty, did you solemnly promise me that my son Solomon would succeed you as king? How is it that Adonijah has become king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nathan added: »While you are still talking with King David, I will come in and confirm your story.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. He was very old, and Abishag, the young woman from Shunem, was taking care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Bathsheba bowed low before the king. He asked: »What do you want?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She answered: »Your Majesty, you made me a solemn promise in the name of Jehovah your God that my son Solomon would be king after you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Adonijah has already become king. You do not know anything about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»He has offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves. He invited your sons, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of your army to the feast. However he did not invite your son Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Your Majesty. The people of Israel want you to tell them who is to succeed you as king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»If you do not my son Solomon and I will be treated as traitors when you die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nathan arrived at the palace while she spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The king was told that the prophet was there. Nathan went in and bowed low before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nathan said: »Your Majesty. Did you announce that Adonijah would succeed you as king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»This very day he has gone and offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves. He invited all your sons, Joab the commander of your army, and Abiathar the priest, and right now they are feasting with him and shouting: Long live King Adonijah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»But he did not invite Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon or me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Did Your Majesty approve all this and not even tell your officials who is to succeed you as king?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>King David said: »Ask Bathsheba to come back in.« She came and stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said to her: »I promise you by the living God Jehovah, who has rescued me from all my troubles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that today I will keep the promise I made to you in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, that your son Solomon would succeed me as king.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Bathsheba bowed low and said: »May my lord the king live a very long time!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then King David sent for Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah. When they came in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he said to them: »Take my court officials with you; have my son Solomon ride my own mule, and escort him to Gihon Spring,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Zadok and Nathan are to anoint him as king of Israel. Then blow the trumpet and shout: Long live King Solomon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Follow him back here when he comes to sit on my throne. He will succeed me as king. He is the one I have chosen to be the ruler over Israel and Judah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»It will be done,« answered Benaiah, »and may Jehovah your God confirm it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Jehovah has been with Your Majesty. May he also be with Solomon and make his reign even more prosperous than yours.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the royal bodyguards put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon Spring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Zadok took the container of olive oil that he had brought from the Tent of Jehovahs presence, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people shouted: »Long live King Solomon!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>All the people followed him. They blew flutes and celebrated so loudly that their voices shook the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Adonijah and all his guests heard this while they were eating. When Joab heard the sound of the horn, he asked: »Why all this noise in the city?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He was still speaking when Jonathan, son of the priest Abiathar, arrived. »Come in,« Adonijah said: »You are an honorable man. You must be bringing good news.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»Not at all,« Jonathan answered Adonijah. »His Majesty King David has made Solomon king!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»The king sent the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites with him. They placed him on the king's mule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»The priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anointed him king at Gihon. They came from there celebrating. The city is excited. That is the sound you heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Solomon is seated on the royal throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Even the royal officials have come to congratulate His Majesty King David, saying: May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his reign greater than your reign. The king himself bowed down on his bed</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and prayed: Let us praise Jehovah the God of Israel. Today he made one of my descendants succeed me as king. He let me live to see it!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Adonijah's guests were afraid. So they all left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Adonijah, in great fear of Solomon, went to the Tent of Jehovahs presence and grabbed hold of the corners of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>King Solomon was told that Adonijah was afraid of him and that he was holding on to the corners of the altar. He heard that he said: »First, I want King Solomon to swear to me that he will not have me put to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Solomon replied: »If he is loyal, not even a hair on his head will be touched. If he is not, he will die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>King Solomon then sent for Adonijah and had him brought down from the altar. Adonijah went to the king and bowed low before him. The king said to him: »You may go home.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
