It is ours!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ahab asked Jehoshaphat: »Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?« »I am ready when you are,« Jehoshaphat answered. »And so are my soldiers and my cavalry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»First let us inquire of Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Ahab called in the prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked them: »Should I attack Ramoth, or not?« They answered: »Attack, Jehovah will give you victory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jehoshaphat asked: »Is there another prophet through whom we can consult Jehovah?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ahab answered: »There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, always something bad.« »The king should not say such things!« Jehoshaphat replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Ahab called a court official and told him to get Micaiah at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They dressed in their royal robes and sat on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria. The two kings listened to all the prophets prophesy in front of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab: »Jehovah says: With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the other prophets said the same thing: »March against Ramoth and you will win,« they said. »Jehovah will give you victory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him: »All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king. You had better do the same.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Micaiah answered: »By the living God Jehovah I promise that I will say what he tells me to say!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He appeared before King Ahab. The king asked him: »Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?« »Attack!« Micaiah answered. »You will win. Jehovah will give you victory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Ahab replied: »Tell the truth when you speak to me in the name of Jehovah! How many times do I have to tell you that?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Micaiah answered: »I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd.« Jehovah said: »These men have no leader. Let them go home in peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Israels king said to Jehoshaphat: »Did I not say to you, He will prophesy about me? It is always something bad!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Micaiah continued: »Now listen to what Jehovah says! I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne in heaven, with all his angels standing beside him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jehovah asked: »Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and be killed at Ramoth? Some of the angels said one thing, and others said something else,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>until a spirit stepped forward, approached Jehovah,« and said: »I will deceive him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»How will you deceive him?« Jehovah asked. The spirit replied: »I will make all of Ahab's prophets tell lies.« Jehovah said: »Go and deceive him. You will succeed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Micaiah concluded: This is what has happened. Jehovah made these prophets of yours lie to you. He has decreed that you will meet with disaster!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The prophet Zedekiah went to Micaiah and slapped his face. He asked: »Since when did Jehovahs spirit leave me and speak to you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»You will see when you go into an inner chamber to hide.« Micaiah replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The king of Israel said: »Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the ruler of the town, and to Joash, the king's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Tell them: It is the king's order that this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till I come again in peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Micaiah said: If you come back at all in peace, Jehovah has not sent his word by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: »I will change my clothing, so that I do not seem to be the king. Then I will go into the fight. You put on your royal robes. So the king of Israel changed his dress and went into the battle.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the king of Aram had given orders to the thirty-two captains of his war-carriages, saying: »Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said: »Truly, this is the king of Israel.« They turned against him and surrounded him. Jehoshaphat gave a cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When the captains of the chariots saw that he was not the king of Israel they withdrew from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A stray arrow wounded the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing. He said to the chariot driver: »Go to the side. Take me away from the fight for I am badly wounded.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The fight grew more violent as the day went on. The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians Aramaeans. The floor of the chariot was covered with the blood from his wound. By evening he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>About sundown a cry went up from all parts of the army, saying: »Let every man go back to his town and his country, for the king is dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They traveled to Samaria and buried the king there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria the bathing-place of the loose women. Dogs were drinking his blood there, as Jehovah said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Everything else that King Ahab did, including an account of his palace decorated with ivory and of all the cities he built, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Ahabs son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of the reign of King Ahab of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He was thirty-five years old. He ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Like his father Asa before him, he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah. However the places of worship were not destroyed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Everything else that Jehoshaphat did, all his bravery and his battles, are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He banished all the male and female prostitutes serving at the pagan altars who were still left from the days of his father Asa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The land of Edom had no king. A deputy appointed by the king of Judah ruled it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>King Jehoshaphat had ocean-going ships built to sail to the land of Ophir for gold. They were wrecked at Eziongeber and never sailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>King Ahaziah of Israel offered to let his men sail with Jehoshaphat's men. Jehoshaphat refused the offer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City. His son Jehoram succeeded him as king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel. It was the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. Ahaziah ruled in Samaria for two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He sinned against Jehovah, following the wicked example of his father Ahab, his mother Jezebel, and King Jeroboam, who had led Israel into sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He worshiped and served Baal. Like his father before him, he aroused the anger of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
