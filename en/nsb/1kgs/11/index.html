They were of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jehovah warned the children of Israel about these nations. He said: »You are not to take wives from them and they are not to take wives from you. They will certainly turn your hearts to go after their gods.« Solomon loved his wives anyway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He had seven hundred wives, daughters of kings, and three hundred other wives. His wives influenced his heart to turn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When Solomon was old he allowed his heart to be turned away to other gods by his wives. His heart was no longer true to Jehovah his God as the heart of his father David had been.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Milcom, the disgusting god of the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Solomon did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. He did not walk in Jehovahs ways with all his heart as David his father did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Solomon put up a high place for Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, in the mountain near Jerusalem. And for Molech, the disgusting god worshipped by the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He did likewise for all his strange wives, who made offerings with burning of perfumes to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehovah was angry with Solomon. This is because his heart turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had twice come to him in a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah had given him orders about this very thing that he was not to go after other gods. But he did not obey the orders of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jehovah said to Solomon: »Because you have done this, and have not kept the agreement and laws I gave you, I will take the kingdom away from you by force and will give it to your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I will not do it in your lifetime, because of your father David, but I will take it from your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Still I will not take the entire kingdom from him. I will give one tribe to your son, because of my servant David, and because of Jerusalem, the town of my selection.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah sent Hadad the Edomite to make trouble for Solomon. He was of the king's seed in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When David had sent destruction on Edom, and Joab, the commander of the army went to bury the dead. They put to death every male in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Joab and all Israel stayed there six months until they had destroyed every male in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hadad was a young boy at the time. He and some of his father's Edomite servants fled to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They left Midian and went to Paran. Taking some men from Paran with them, they went to Pharaoh the king of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a home, a food allowance, and land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pharaoh approved of Hadad. So he gave Hadad his sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, to be Hadad's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tahpenes' sister had a son named Genubath. Tahpenes presented the boy to Pharaoh in the palace, and Genubath lived in the palace among Pharaoh's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When the news reached Hadad in Egypt that David had died and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to the king: »Let me go back to my own country.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Why?« The king asked. »Have I failed to give you something? Is that why you want to go back home?« Hadad answered: »Just let me go.« He went back to his country. As king of Edom, Hadad was an evil, bitter enemy of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>God also caused Rezon son of Eliada to turn against Solomon. Rezon had fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and had become the leader of a gang of outlaws. This happened after David defeated Hadadezer and slaughtered his Syrian allies. Rezon and his gang lived in Damascus, where his followers made him king of Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was trouble to Israel all through the days of Solomon. This is the damage Hadad did: he was cruel to Israel while he was ruler over Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeroboam rebelled against the king. He was the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was Zeruah, a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is how he rebelled: Solomon was building the Millo supporting terraces and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jeroboam was a capable and responsible man. Solomon saw that he was a good worker and made him overseer of all the work given to the sons of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite came across him on the road. Ahijah was wearing a new robe. They were by themselves in the open country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Ahijah took his new robe in his hands and tore it into twelve pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said to Jeroboam: »Take ten of the parts, for this is what Jehovah said: I will take the kingdom away from Solomon by force. I will give ten tribes to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»But one tribe will be his because of my servant David, and because of Jerusalem. Out of the tribes of Israel he will have the town I have made mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has worshiped foreign gods. Astarte, the goddess of Sidon; Chemosh, the god of Moab; and Molech, the god of Ammon. Solomon disobeyed me. He has done wrong! He has not obeyed my laws and commands as his father David did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I will not take the entire kingdom away from Solomon. I will keep him in power as long as he lives. This I will do for the sake of my servant David, whom I chose and who obeyed my laws and commands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»I will take the kingdom away from Solomon's son and will give you ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»I will let Solomon's son keep one tribe. That way I will always have a descendant of my servant David ruling in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen as the place where I am worshiped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Jeroboam, I will make you king of Israel. You will rule over all the territory that you want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»If you obey me completely I will always be with you. You must live by my laws, and win my approval by doing what I command, as my servant David did. I will make you king of Israel and will make sure that your descendants rule after you, just as I have done for David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Because of Solomon's sin I will punish the descendants of David, but not forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For this reason Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam. Jeroboam escaped to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until Solomon's death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Everything else that Solomon did, his career, and his wisdom, are all recorded in The History of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He was king in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He died and was buried in David's City. His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
