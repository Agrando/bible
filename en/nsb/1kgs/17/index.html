I have ordered the ravens to feed you there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he did as Jehovah said, living by the Cherith Brook, east of Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening. And he drank water from the brook.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now after a time the brook became dry, because there was no rain in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the word of Jehovah came to him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Go now to Zarephath, in Zidon, and live there. I have given orders to a widow woman there to see that you have food.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the town, he saw a widow woman gathering sticks. He said to her: »Will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As she was going to get it, he said: »And get me some bread.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then she said: »By the life of Jehovah your God, I have nothing but a little meal, and a drop of oil in the bottle; and now I am getting two sticks together so that I may go in and make it ready for me and my son, so that we may have a meal before our death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Elijah said to her: »Have no fear. Go and do as you said, but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me. Then make something for yourself and your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»For this is the word of Jehovah, the God of Israel: Your supply of meal will not come to an end. The bottle will never be without oil, till the day when Jehovah sends rain on the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She did as Elijah told her and they all had food for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The store of meal did not come to an end. The bottle was never without oil. This was just as Jehovah said through the mouth of Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>After this the son of the woman of the house became ill. He was so ill that there was no breath in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She said to Elijah: »What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to put God in mind of my sin, and to put my son to death?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said: »Give your son to me.« And lifting him out of her arms, he took him up to his room and put him down on his bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Crying to Jehovah he said: »O Jehovah my God, have you sent evil even on the widow I now visit, by causing her son's death?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Stretching himself out on the child three times, he made his prayer to Jehovah. He said: »O Jehovah my God, be pleased to let this child's life come back to him again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jehovah listened to the voice of Elijah. The child began to breath and came back to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother. »See, your son is alive.« He said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the woman said to Elijah: »Now I am certain that you are a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in your mouth is truth.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
