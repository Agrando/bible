That is where the prophet Ahijah lives. He is the one who said I would be king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Take him ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey. Ask him what is going to happen to our son. He will tell you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>She went to Ahijah's home in Shiloh. Old age had made Ahijah blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah told him: »Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is sick.« Jehovah told Ahijah what to say. Jeroboam's wife pretended to be someone else when she arrived there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ahijah heard her coming in the door and said: »Come in. I know you are Jeroboam's wife. Why do you pretend to be someone else? I have bad news for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Go and tell Jeroboam that this is what Jehovah, the God of Israel, says to him: I chose you from among the people and made you the ruler of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I took the kingdom away from David's descendants and gave it to you. You have not been like my servant David. He was completely loyal to me. He obeyed my commands, and did only what I approve of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»You have committed far greater sins than those who ruled before you. You have rejected me and have aroused my anger by making idols and metal images to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will kill all your male descendants, young and old alike. I will get rid of your family. They will be swept away like dung.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Dogs will eat members of your family who die in the city. Vultures will eat any who die in the open country. I, Jehovah, have spoken!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ahijah went on to say to Jeroboam's wife: »Go back home. As soon as you enter the town, your son will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»All the people of Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He will be the only member of Jeroboam's family who will be properly buried for he is the only one with whom Jehovah, the God of Israel, is pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Jehovah will place a king over Israel who will put an end to Jeroboam's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Jehovah will punish Israel, and she will shake like a reed shaking in a stream. He will uproot the people of Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors. He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have aroused his anger by making idols of the goddess Asherah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Jehovah will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and led the people of Israel into sin.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jeroboam's wife went back to Tirzah. Just as she entered her home, the child died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The people of Israel mourned for him and buried him. This is as Jehovah said through his servant, the prophet Ahijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Everything else that King Jeroboam did, the wars he fought and how he ruled, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jeroboam ruled as king for twenty-two years. He died and was buried. His son Nadab succeeded him as king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Solomon's son Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king of Judah. He ruled seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city Jehovah chose from all the territory of Israel as the place where he was to be worshiped. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah from Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The people of Judah sinned against Jehovah. They did more to arouse his anger against them than all their ancestors had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They built places of worship for false gods. They put up stone pillars and symbols of Asherah to worship on the hills and under shady trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There were also male cult prostitutes in the temples of idols throughout the land. The people of Judah practiced all the disgusting practices done by the nations that Jehovah forced out of the Israelites' way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of Rehoboams reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He took the treasures from Jehovahs Temple and the royal palace. He took them all. He took all the gold shields Solomon had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Rehoboam replaced them with bronze shields and entrusted them to the officers responsible for guarding the palace gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The guards carried the shields every time the king went to the Temple and then returned them to the guardroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and everything he did are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman. And Abijam his son became king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
