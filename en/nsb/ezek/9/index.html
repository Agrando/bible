Bring your weapons with you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Six men came from the direction of the upper gate that faces north. Each had his shattering weapon in his hand. Among them was a certain man clothed in linen with a writing case secretarys inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood beside the copper altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the dazzling light of the presence of the God of Israel rose up from the winged creatures where it had been. It moved to the entrance of the Temple. Jehovah called to the man dressed in linen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Go through the whole city of Jerusalem and put a mark signature on the forehead of everyone who is distressed and troubled because of all the disgusting things being done in the city.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I heard God say to the other men: »Follow him through the city and kill. Spare no one! Have mercy on no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Kill the old men, young men, young women, mothers, and children. But do not touch anyone who has the mark on his forehead. Start here at my Temple.« So they began with the elders who were standing there at the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said to them: »Dishonor the Temple! Fill its courtyards with dead people, and then leave.« So they went out and killed the people in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>While they were killing people, I was left alone. So I immediately bowed down. I cried: »Help me O Lord Jehovah. Will you destroy everyone who is left in Israel while you pour out your anger on Jerusalem?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He answered me: »The wickedness of the nations of Israel and Judah is terrible! The land is filled with murder, and the city is filled with wrongdoing. They think that Jehovah has abandoned the land and that he does not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»But my eye will not feel sorry I will not have compassion or feel sorry. I will do to them what they have done to others.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the person dressed in linen who was carrying the writing case inkhorn reported: »I did everything you commanded.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
