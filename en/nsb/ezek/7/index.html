The end has come upon the four corners of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»The end is now upon you and I will unleash my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I will not look on you with pity or spare you. I will repay you for your conduct and the detestable practices among you. THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM JEHOVAH.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The Lord Jehovah says: Disaster! An unheard-of disaster is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The end has come! The end has come! It has become active against you. It has come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Doom has come upon you who dwell in the land. The time has come, the day is near. There is panic, not joy, upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I will not look on you with pity or spare you my eye will not feel sorry for you. I will repay you in accordance with your conduct and the detestable practices among you. Then you will know that it is I, Jehovah, who strikes the blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The day is here! It has come! Doom has burst forth. The rod has budded, and arrogance has blossomed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Violence has grown into a weapon for punishing wickedness. None of the people will be left. None of that crowd, none of their wealth, and nothing of value will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The time is coming. The day is near. Buyers will not rejoice, and sellers will not mourn, because my fury will be against the whole crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Sellers will not live long enough to buy back what they have sold. The visions against that crowd will not change. Because of their sins, none of the people will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»They have blown a ram's horn and everything is ready. But no one will go into battle, because my fury is against their whole crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Outside are swords and inside are plagues and famines. He who is in a field will die in battle. He who is in the city will be devoured by famines and plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Some will escape to the mountains like doves frightened from the valleys. All of them will moan over their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Everyones hands will be weak, and their knees will shake and they will drip from sweat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»They will put on sackcloth and they will tremble all over. Their heads will be shaved, and they will all be disgraced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»They will throw their gold and silver away in the streets like garbage like an abhorrent thing, because neither silver nor gold can save them when Jehovah pours out his fury. They cannot use it to satisfy their desires or fill their stomachs. Gold and silver led them into sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Once they were proud of their beautiful jewels, but they used them to make disgusting idols. That is why Jehovah has made their wealth repulsive to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I will hand it all over as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth, and they will defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»I will turn my face away from them. They will desecrate my treasured place. Robbers will enter it and desecrate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Prepare chains for the land is full of bloodshed and the city full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I will bring the wicked of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»When terror comes they will seek peace, but there will be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will try to get a vision from the prophet. The teaching of the law by the priest will be lost, as will the counsel of the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The king will mourn. The prince will be clothed with despair and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct. By their own standards I will judge them. Then they will know that I am Jehovah.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
