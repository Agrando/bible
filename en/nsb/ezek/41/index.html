They were ten and one half feet wide on each side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The entrance was seventeen and one half feet wide, and on each side of the entrance the walls were nine feet wide. Then he measured the length of the holy place. It was seventy feet long and thirty-five feet wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He went inside and measured the passageway. It was three and one half feet thick. The entrance was ten and one half feet high and twelve feet wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He measured the room at the end of the holy place. It was thirty-five feet long and thirty-five feet wide. The man said: »This is the Most Holy Place Holy of Holies.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Next, the man measured the Temple wall. It was ten and one half feet wide, and each side room around the Temple was seven feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The rooms were arranged on three different stories. There were thirty rooms on each story. These rooms had supports all the way around the Temple wall, but these supports were not fastened to the Temple wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The side rooms grew wider all the way around as they went up, story after story. The surrounding structure went from story to story all around the Temple. The structure grew wider as it went higher. A stairway went from the first story through the second story to the third story.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I also saw a raised base all around the Temple. This base was the foundation for the side rooms. It measured the full length of the measuring rod, ten and one half feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The outer wall of the side rooms was nine feet thick. There was an open area between the side rooms connected to the Temple</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the priests' rooms. It was thirty-five feet wide and went all around the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The doors in the side rooms were entrances into the open area. There was one door to the north and another to the south. The base of the open area was nine feet wide all the way around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At the far end of the open area, on the west side of the temple, was a building one hundred twenty-two and one-half feet wide. The wall of the building was nine feet thick all the way around, and it was one hundred fifty seven and one half feet long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The man measured the Temple. It was one hundred and seventy-five feet long. This included the open area with the building and its walls. All together it was one hundred and seventy-five feet long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The eastern side of the Temple, including the open area, was also one hundred and seventy-five feet wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He also measured the length of the building facing the courtyard on the west side along with its corridors on both sides. It was one hundred and seventy-five feet long. The holy place and the Most Holy Place were paneled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The doorposts, the small windows, and the corridors of all three stories were paneled. The walls, from the floor up to the windows, were paneled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the space above the door to the Most Holy Place and on the walls all around it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>there were pictures of cherubim angels and palm trees. Palm trees were positioned between each of the angels, and each angel had two faces:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the face of a man, which was turned toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion, which was turned toward a palm tree on the other side. These pictures were carved all around the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pictures of cherubim angels and palm trees were carved on the walls from the floor to the space above the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The doorframes in the Holy Place were square. In front of the Most Holy Place was something similar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There was a wooden altar. It was five feet high and three and one half feet wide. Its corners, its base, and its sides were made of wood. Then the man told me: This is the table that is in the presence of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Holy Place and the Most Holy Place had two doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Each of the doors were double doors that swung open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pictures of cherubim angels and palm trees were carved on the doors of the Holy Place as on the walls. There was a wooden roof hanging over the outer entrance hall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There were small windows and palm trees on both sides of the entrance hall, on the side rooms of the Temple, and on the roofs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
