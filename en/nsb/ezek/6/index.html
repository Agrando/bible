This is what the Lord Jehovah says to the mountains and hills and to the ravines and valleys: »I am going to attack you with a sword and destroy your worship sites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Your altars will be destroyed! Your incense burners will be smashed. I will kill your people in front of your idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel in front of your idols. I will even scatter their bones around your altars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Your dwelling places in the cities will be ruined, and the worship sites will be wrecked. Your altars will be ruined and demolished. Your idols will be smashed and completely destroyed. Your incense burners will be cut down. Everything you have done will be wiped out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Your people will be killed and they will fall among you. Then you will know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»However, I will let some people live. Some people will escape the battle among the nations and be scattered throughout the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Then those who escape will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive. I was hurt by their adulterous hearts, which turned away from me, and by their eyes, which lusted after idols. They will hate themselves for the evil and disgusting things that they have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Then you will know that I am Jehovah and that the disaster I promised was not an empty threat.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The Lord Jehovah says: Clap your hands, stomp your feet, and say, How sad! The people of Israel have done evil and disgusting things. So they will die in wars, famines, and plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Plagues will kill those who are far away. Those who are near will die in wars. Anyone who is left and has escaped will die of famine. This is how I will unleash my rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Then you will know that I am Jehovah. Those who are killed will lie beside the idols around their altars. They will lie on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every large tree and every leafy oak. These are the places where they made offerings to their disgusting idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I will stretch out my hand use my power against them and destroy the land from the desert to Diblah. THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT I AM JEHOVAH!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
