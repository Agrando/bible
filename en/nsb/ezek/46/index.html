It must also be opened on the New Moon Festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»The prince must enter from the outside through the entrance hall of the gateway. He must stand by the doorposts of the gateway. Then the priests must prepare the prince's burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He must worship at the entrance of the gateway and then leave. The gate must not be closed until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»The common people must worship at the door of the gateway in the presence of Jehovah on the weekly days of worship and on New Moon Festivals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The prince must offer to Jehovah six lambs that have no defects and one ram that has no defects as a burnt offering on the day of worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The grain offering that is to be brought with the ram must be a half-bushel, and the grain offering that is to be brought with the lambs must be whatever the prince can bring. One gallon of olive oil must be brought with each half-bushel of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»On the first day of the month, the burnt offering must be one young bull, six lambs, and one ram-all animals that have no defects.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»With each young bull and each ram the offering must include a half-bushel of grain, and with each lamb the offering must be whatever the prince wants to bring. One gallon of olive oil must be offered with each half-bushel of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»When the prince enters, he must enter through the entrance hall of the gateway. He must enter and leave the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The people will enter Jehovahs presence at the time of the appointed festivals. Those entering through the north gate to worship must leave through the south gate. Those entering through the south gate must leave through the north gate. They must not leave through the same gate they entered. They must leave through the opposite gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The prince must be among them. When they enter, he must enter. When they leave, he must leave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>On festival days and at appointed festivals, a grain offering of a half-bushel must be brought with each young bull, and a half-bushel must be brought with each ram. But with the lambs, the prince may bring whatever he wants to bring. One gallon of olive oil must be brought with each half-bushel of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»When the prince prepares a freewill burnt offering, either a burnt offering or a fellowship offering to Jehovah, the east gate must be opened for him.

It will be a grain offering dedicated to Jehovah. These rules are to be followed always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the olive oil every morning as a daily burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»The Lord Jehovah says: Suppose the prince offers one of his sons a gift from his property. The gift will belong to his descendants because it is their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Suppose the prince offers a gift from his property to one of his servants. The gift will belong to the servant only until the year of freedom. Then the gift will go back to the prince. Only his sons can inherit his property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The prince must not take any of the people's property. He must not force them to give up their property. He must give his own property as an inheritance to his sons so that none of my people will be separated from their property.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The man brought me through a passage beside the gateway to the side rooms that faced north. These rooms were reserved for the priests. He showed me a place on the west side of the rooms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to me: »This is the place where the priests must boil the meat for the guilt offering and the offering for sin. This is the place where they must bake grain offerings so that they do not have to bring the offerings into the outer courtyard. This way they will not transfer holiness to the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The man led me to the outer courtyard and took me past the four corners of the courtyard. I saw that in each corner of the courtyard there was a smaller courtyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The smaller courtyards that were in each of the four corners of the courtyard were sixty feet long and forty-five feet wide. All four of the smaller courtyards in the corners of the courtyard were the same size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Around each of the four courtyards were stonewalls, and these walls were equipped with fireplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The man said to me: »These are the kitchens where the Temple servants must boil the people's sacrifices.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
