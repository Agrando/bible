And I saw something that looked like a throne made of sapphire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jehovah said to the person dressed in linen: »Go between the wheels under the angels and fill your hands with burning coals. Then scatter them over the city.« So he went between the wheels as I watched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The angels cherubs were standing on the south side of the Temple as the person went. A cloud filled the inner courtyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehovahs glory rose from the angels to the entrance of the Temple. The cloud filled the Temple, and the brightness of Jehovahs glory filled the courtyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The sound of the angels' wings was heard as far as the outer courtyard. It was like the sound of the Almighty God when he speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After Jehovah had commanded the person dressed in linen to take burning coals from between the wheels beside the angels, the person went in and stood beside one of the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>One of the angels reached into the fire that was between the angels and took out some coals. This angel put them in the hands of the person dressed in linen. The person took them and left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I saw that each creature had what looked like a human hand under each of its wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the angels. There was one wheel beside each angel. The appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a chrysolite stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All four of them had the same likeness in appearance, as if one wheel was within another wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. They followed in the direction that they faced, without turning as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around. The wheels belonged to all four of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The wheels were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Each one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub angel, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The angels rose. These were the living creatures that I saw at the Chebar River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When the angels moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the angels lifted their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When the angels stood still, the wheels stood still. When the angels rose, the wheels rose with them. The spirit of the living creatures was in them the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the glory of Jehovah left the Temple's entrance and stood over the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The angels lifted their wings and rose from the ground. I was watching them as they left with the wheels beside them. The angels stood at the door to the east gate of Jehovahs Temple, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the living creatures that I saw under the God of Israel at the Chebar River. I realized that they were angels cherubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings were what looked like human hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Their faces looked exactly like the faces that I saw by the Chebar River. Each one went straight ahead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
