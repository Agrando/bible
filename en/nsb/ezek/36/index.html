And the everlasting heights have become our possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Therefore prophesy and say: The Lord Jehovah says: For good reason they have made you desolate and crushed you from every side. That way you would become a possession of the rest of the nations and you have become a subject of conversation for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah.

Their ways were as unclean as a woman's menstrual period.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Therefore I poured out my fury on them because they poured out blood on the land and they dishonored the land with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I forced them into other nations. They became scattered among the nations. I judged them based on the way that they lived and based on everything that they had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Wherever they went among the nations, they dishonored my holy name. People said about them: These are Jehovahs people, yet they had to leave his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I became concerned about my holy name because my people dishonored it among the nations wherever they went.« (Romans 2:21-24)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»So tell the people of Israel, the Lord Jehovah says: »I am about to do something, people of Israel.

You will hate yourselves for all these wicked and disgusting things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, proclaims the Lord Jehovah. Be ashamed and disgraced because of your ways, people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»This is what the Lord Jehovah says: On the day that I cleanse you from all your wickedness, I will cause your cities to be lived in again, and your ruins will be rebuilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The wasteland will be cultivated. It will no longer remain empty for everyone passing by to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>People will say: »This wasteland has become like the Garden of Eden. The cities were destroyed. They were empty and ruined, but now they are fortified and have people living in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The surrounding nations that are left will know that I, Jehovah, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted crops in the land that was empty. I, Jehovah, have spoken, and I have done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»This is what the Lord Jehovah says: I will also let the people of Israel ask me to make them as numerous as sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»They will be like the sheep for sacrifices, like the sheep in Jerusalem during the appointed festivals. Their ruined cities will be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am Jehovah.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
