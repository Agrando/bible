Eat this scroll. Then speak to the people of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He said: »Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you, and fill your stomach with it.« So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He then said to me: »Son of man, go to the people of Israel and speak my words to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I am not sending you to people whose language is hard to understand or difficult to speak. I am sending you to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I am not sending you to nations whose language is hard to understand, difficult to speak, or whose words you cannot understand. If I send you to those nations they will certainly listen to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»But the people of Israel will refuse to listen to you because they refuse to listen to me. All the people of Israel are very stubborn and hardheaded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Yet, I will make you as stubborn and as hardheaded as they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I will make you as hard as a diamond, harder than flint stone. Do not be afraid of them. Do not be terrified in their presence, even though they are rebellious people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He also said: »Son of man, take to heart everything I have spoken to you, and listen closely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Go to the exiles, to your people. Whether they listen or not, tell them: This is what the Lord Jehovah says.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Spirit lifted me, and behind me I heard a loud thundering voice say: »Blessed is Jehovahs glory from this place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures touching one another and the noise of the wheels beside them as well as a loud rumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Spirit lifted me and took me away. I went away feeling bitter and angry. The strong power of Jehovah came over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I went to Tel Abib, to the exiles that lived by the Chebar River. I sat there among them for seven days. I was stunned among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After seven days Jehovah spoke his word to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Son of man, I have made you a watchman over the people of Israel. Listen to what I say, and warn them for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»When I tell a wicked man that he will surely die, but you do not warn him or speak out so that he can change his wicked way in order to save his life; that wicked man will die because of his sin. I will hold you responsible for his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»When you warn the wicked man, and he does not turn from his wicked way; he will die because of his sin, but you will save yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»If righteous people turn from living the right way and do wrong, I will make them stumble and they will die. If you do not warn them, they will die because of their sin. The right things they did will not be remembered. I will hold you responsible for their deaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»If you warn righteous people not to sin, and they do not sin, they will certainly live because they listened to the warning and you will save yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The power of Jehovah came over me. He said: »Get up, and go to the plain. I will speak to you there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I got up and went to the plain. Jehovahs glory was standing there like the glory I saw by the Chebar River. So I immediately bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Spirit entered me and stood me on my feet. He talked to me. He said: »Go shut yourself in your home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»People will tie you up with ropes, son of man, so that you cannot go outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you cannot talk or criticize them, even though they are rebellious people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth. You will tell them: This is what the Lord Jehovah says. Some will listen and some will refuse to listen for they are a rebellious people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
