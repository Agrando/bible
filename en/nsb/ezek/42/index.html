He brought me to the side rooms opposite both the open area and the northern building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The building that faced north was one hundred and seventy-five feet long and eighty-seven and one half feet wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Opposite the inner courtyard was an area that was thirty-five feet wide, and opposite the pavement of the outer courtyard were corridors facing corridors on all three stories.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In front of the side rooms was a walkway. It was seventeen and one half feet wide and one hundred and seventy-five feet long. The doors of these side rooms faced north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The side rooms on the third story were narrower than those on the first or second stories of the building because the corridors took space away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The rooms were in three stories. They did not have pillars like the pillars in the courtyards. That is why the rooms on the third story were set farther back than those on the first and second stories.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There was a wall that ran parallel to the side rooms and the outer courtyard. It ran alongside the side rooms for eighty-seven and one half feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The row of rooms in the outer courtyard was eighty-seven and one half feet long. The rooms that faced the temple were one hundred and seventy-five feet long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These lower side rooms had an entrance on the east side. A person was able to enter the outer courtyard through them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There were side rooms parallel to the wall of the courtyard on the south side. They faced the open area and the building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There was a walkway in front of them. It was like the one that was in front of the side rooms on the north side. These side rooms were as long and as wide as the northern rooms. They had similar exits, dimensions, and doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The doors to the south rooms were the same as the doors to the north rooms. There was a doorway at the other end of the walkway that was parallel to the corresponding wall that ran eastward. People entered through that doorway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The man said: Â»The northern and southern side rooms that face the open area are holy rooms. These rooms are where the priests who come near Jehovah eat the holiest offerings. Because these rooms are holy, the priests keep the holiest offerings there: the grain offerings, the offerings for sin, and the guilt offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Once the priests enter the Holy Place, they must not go out of the Holy Place into the outer courtyard until they leave behind the clothes that they wore as they served. These clothes are holy. The priests must put on other clothes. Then they can go into the area that is for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When the man had finished measuring the inner part of the temple area, he led me out through the east gate. Then he measured all the way around the outer area.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He measured the east side with a measuring stick. It was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long according to the measuring stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He measured the north side. It was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long according to the measuring stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He measured the south side. It was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long according to the measuring stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He came around to the west side and measured it. It was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long according to the measuring stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He measured all four sides. There was a wall all around it. The wall was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long and eight hundred and seventy-five feet wide. It separated what was holy from what was unholy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
