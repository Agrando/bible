It is the gate that faces east. Twenty-five men were at the entrance of the gate. I saw among them Azzur's son Jaazaniah and Benaiah's son Pelatiah. They were leaders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jehovah said to me: »Son of man, these are the men who plan evil and give bad advice in this city Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»They say: It is almost time to rebuild houses. This city is a cooking pot, and we are the meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»So prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovahs Spirit came to me and told me to say: »This is what Jehovah says: You are saying these things, nation of Israel. But I know what is going through your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You have killed many people in this city and have filled its streets with corpses.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I, the Lord Jehovah, say to you: This city is a cooking pot all right, but what is the meat? The corpses of those you have killed! You will not be here. I will throw you out of the city!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Are you afraid of swords? I will bring soldiers with swords to attack you, is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will take you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners. I will execute judgments against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»You will be killed in battle in your own country. I will judge you on the border of Israel. Then everyone will know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»This city will not protect you the way a cooking pot protects the meat in it. I will punish you wherever you may be in the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»You will know that I am Jehovah! While you were keeping the laws of the neighboring nations, you were breaking my laws and disobeying my commands.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»It happened while I prophesied, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said: Alas, O Lord Jehovah! Will you bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the word of Jehovah came to me, He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles and the whole house of Israel, all of them are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Go far from Jehovah. This land has been given us as a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Therefore say: Thus says the Lord Jehovah: »Though I had removed them far away among the nations and though I had scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary holy placeshelterprotection for them a little while in the countries where they had gone.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Therefore say, The Lord Jehovah says: »I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries among which you have been scattered. I will give you the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»When they come there, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I will give them one united heart, and put a new spirit within them. I will take the heart of stone unkind attitude out of them and give them a heart of flesh loving disposition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»In this way they may walk in my statutes and obey my ordinances. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Concerning those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down on their heads, declares the Lord Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the cherubim angels lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The glory of Jehovah went up from within the city and stood over the mountain that is east of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea. So the vision that I had seen left me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then I told the exiles all the things that Jehovah had shown me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
