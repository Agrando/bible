You have said: My Nile is mine! I have made it!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales. I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers. All the fish of your rivers will cling to your scales.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will abandon you to the wilderness and all the fish of your rivers. You will fall on the open field. You will not be brought together or gathered. I have given you for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Jehovah. This is because they have been only a staff made of reed to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»When they took hold of you with the hand, you broke and tore all their hands. When they leaned on you, you broke and made all their loins quake.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Therefore the Lord Jehovah says: »I will bring upon you a sword and I will cut off from you man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The land of Egypt will become a desolation and waste. Then they will know that I am Jehovah. Because you said: The Nile is mine, and I have made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I am against you and against your rivers. I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene and even to the border of Ethiopia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»A man's foot will not pass through it, and the foot of a beast will not pass through it, and it will not be inhabited for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»So I will make the land of Egypt desolation in the midst of desolated lands. And her cities, in the midst of cities that are laid waste, will be desolate forty years. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The Lord Jehovah says: »At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»»I will turn the fortunes of Egypt and make them return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin. They will be a lowly kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»»It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and it will never again lift itself up above the nations. I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»»It will never again be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing to mind the iniquity of their having turned to Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord Jehovah.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me. He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare. But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had performed against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The Lord Jehovah says: I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He will carry off her wealth and capture her spoil and seize her plunder. It will serve as wages for his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I have given him the land of Egypt for the labor he performed, because they acted for me, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel make the people of Israel strong again, and I give you, Ezekiel, something to say among them. Then they will know that I am Jehovah.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
