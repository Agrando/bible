She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The nations heard about him. He was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»When she saw her hope unfulfilled, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»He prowled among the lions, for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»He broke down their strongholds and devastated their towns. His roaring terrified the residents of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Then the nations came against him, those from regions round about. They spread their net for him, and he was trapped in their pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison. Therefore his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard planted by the water. It was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Its branches were strong and fit for a rulers scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage, conspicuous for its height and for its many branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»It was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel. It was stripped of its fruit. Its strong branches withered and fire consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Fire spread from one of its main branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a rulers scepter. This is a song of grief and is to be used as a song of grief.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
