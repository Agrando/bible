I saw water flowing from under the entrance of the Temple toward the east. The Temple faced east. The water was flowing under the south side of the Temple, south of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then he led me through the north gate and around to the outer east gate. The water was flowing down the south side of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>With a measuring line in his hand, the man went eastward. He measured off fifteen hundred feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my ankles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He measured off another fifteen hundred feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my knees. He measured off another fifteen hundred feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my waist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He measured another fifteen hundred feet. But the water had risen so much that it became a river that I could not cross. The river was too deep to cross except by swimming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He asked me: »Son of man, do you see this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The man then led me back along the bank of the river. As I went back, I saw many trees on both sides of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said: »This water flows through the land to the east, down into the Jordan Valley, and into the Dead Sea. When the water flows into the Dead Sea, it will replace the salt water there with fresh water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Wherever the river flows, there will be many fish and animals. The river will make the water in the Dead Sea fresh. Wherever the river flows, it will bring life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»From En Gedi to En Eglaim people will be standing on the shore of the sea with their fishing nets spread out. As many kinds of fish will be there as there are in the Mediterranean Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»But the water in the swamps and marshes will not become fresh. It will remain salty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and they will not fail to produce fruit. Each month they will produce fresh fruit because this water flows from the Holy Place. The fruit will be good food, and the leaves will be used for healing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is what the Lord Jehovah says: »These are the borders of the land that is to be divided among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph gets two parts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Divide the land equally. I raised my hand and swore that I would give the land to your ancestors. So this land will be your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»This is the northern border for the land: On the north side the border will run from the Mediterranean Sea all the way to Hethlon and Hamath Pass. It will run through the city of Zedad and through</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Berothah and Sibraim, which are between the borders of Damascus and Hamath. It will run to Hazer Hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»So the border will run from the Mediterranean Sea to Hazar Enon on the border of Damascus. The border of Hamath will lie to the north. This is the north side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»On the east side the border will run between Hauran and Damascus. The Jordan River will serve as the border between Gilead and the land of Israel. The border will continue from the Dead Sea down to Tamar. This is the east side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»On the south side the border will run from Tamar to the oasis at Meribah in Kadesh along the ravine to the Mediterranean Sea. This is the southern border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»On the west side the Mediterranean Sea is the border up to a point opposite Hamath Pass. This is the west side.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Divide this land for each of the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Divide it by drawing lots. This land will be for you. It will also be for the foreign residents who live among you and have given birth to children while they lived with you. Think of them as Israelites. They will draw lots with you for their inheritance among the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Foreign residents will receive their share of the inheritance with the people of the tribe among whom they are living,« declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
