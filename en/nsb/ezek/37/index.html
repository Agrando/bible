The valley was full of bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He caused me to pass among them round about. There were very many on the surface of the valley and they were very dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He said to me: »Son of man, can these bones live?« I answered, »O Lord Jehovah, you know.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Again he said: »Prophesy over these bones and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The Lord Jehovah says to these bones: »I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I will put sinews on you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come alive. You will know that I am Jehovah.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling. The bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I looked, sinews were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them. But there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jehovah said to me: »Prophesy to the wind ruach: air, breath, spirit, life! Prophesy, son of man. Tell the wind, this is what the Lord Jehovah says: Come from the four winds, O Breath, and breathe on these people who were killed so that they will live.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath of life entered them. Then they came to life and stood on their feet. There were enough of them to form a very large army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah also said: »Son of man, all the people of Israel are like these bones. The people say: Our bones are dry, and our hope has vanished. We are completely destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Prophesy and tell them: This is what the Lord Jehovah says: »My people, I will open your graves and take you out of them. I will bring you to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then, my people, you will know that I am Jehovah, because I will open your graves and bring you out of your graves.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live. I will place you in your own land. Then you will know that I, Jehovah, have spoken, and I have done it, declares Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah spoke his word to me again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Son of man, take a stick and write on it: For Judah and for the Israelites who are associated with it. Then take another stick and write on it: The stick of Ephraim, for Joseph and for all the people of Israel associated with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then join both sticks together so that they will be one in your hand. Your people will say to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Tell us what you mean by this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then say to them: This is what the Lord Jehovah says: I will take Joseph's stick, which is in Ephraim's hand, and the tribes of Israel associated with it, and I will put them with Judah's stick. I will make them into one stick. They will be one in my hand.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you hold the sticks in your hand, let the people see them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Tell them: The Lord Jehovah says: »I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from everywhere and bring them to their own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will form them into one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel. One king will rule all of them. They will no longer be two nations or be divided into two kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They will no longer dishonor themselves with their idols, with their detestable things, or with their rebellious acts. I will forgive them for all the times they turned away from me and sinned. I will cleanse them so that they will be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»»My servant David will be their king. All of them will have one shepherd. They will live by my rules, and they will obey my laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»»They will live in the land that I gave my servant Jacob, the land where their ancestors lived. They, their children, and their grandchildren will live in it for a very long time. My servant David will be their prince for a very long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»»I will promise them peace. This will be a long lasting promise. I will establish them and make them increase in number. I will put my holy place among them for a very long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»»My dwelling place will be with them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»»Then the nations will know that I, Jehovah, have set Israel apart as holy, because my holy place will be among them permanently.« «</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
