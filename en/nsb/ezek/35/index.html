I will stretch out my hand exert my power against you and make you a desolation and a waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»»I will lay waste your cities and you will become desolated. Then you will know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»»Because you have had everlasting enmity and have delivered the sons of Israel to the power of the sword to die by warfare at the time of their calamity, at the time of the punishment of the end.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Therefore as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah: I will give you over to bloodshed death, and bloodshed death will pursue you.
