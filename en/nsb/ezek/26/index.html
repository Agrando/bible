I will be filled, now that she is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Therefore the Lord Jehovah says: I am against you, O Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers. I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea. I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah. She will become spoil for the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Her daughters on the mainland will be killed by the sword. They will know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The Lord Jehovah says: I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He is king of kings. He has many horses, chariots, cavalry and a great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He will slay your daughters on the mainland with the sword. He will make siege walls against you, cast up a ramp against you and raise up a large shield against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»He will direct the blow of his battering rams against your walls. He will break down your towers with his axes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Dust raised by the vast number of his horses will cover you. The noise of cavalry, wagons and chariots will shake your walls. He will enter your gates as men enter a city that is breached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The hoofs of his horses will trample all your streets. He will slay your people with the sword and your strong pillars will come down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»They will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise. They will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. They will throw your stones and your timbers and your debris into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»So I will silence the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps will be heard no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I will make you a bare rock. You will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more, for I Jehovah have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The Lord Jehovah says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan, when the slaughter occurs in your midst?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Then all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones and remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling. They will sit on the ground, tremble every moment and be appalled at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»They will take up a lamentation over you and say to you: »»How you have perished, O inhabited one, from the seas, O renowned city. You were mighty on the sea. She and her inhabitants imposed her terror on all her inhabitants!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»»Now the coastlands will tremble on the day of your fall. Yes, the coastlands by the sea will be terrified at your passing.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The Lord Jehovah says: When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you and the great waters cover you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit grave, to the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth. It will be like the ancient waste places, with those who go down to the pit grave, so that you will not be inhabited; but I will set glory in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I will bring terrors on you and you will be no more. Though you will be sought, you will never be found again, declares the Lord Jehovah.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
