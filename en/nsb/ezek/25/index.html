The Lord Jehovah says: »Because you said, Aha! Against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»»I am going to give you to the sons of the east for a possession. They will set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you.
