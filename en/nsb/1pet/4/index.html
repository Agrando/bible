Your lives were spent in indecency, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and the disgusting worship of idols false gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They think it strange that you do not run with them in wild and reckless living and they speak evil about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The good news was preached for this purpose even to the dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but may live according to God in the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The end of all things is near.
