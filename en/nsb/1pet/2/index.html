He who believes in him will not be disappointed shamed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>This precious value is for those who believe. But for the unbeliever: »The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It is a stone that people stumble over, and a large rock that people find offensive. They stumble because they are disobedient to the word. To this end they were appointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a people for Gods own possession, that you may show the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In time past you were no people, but now you are the people of God. You had not then received, but now have received mercy compassiondivine kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, I request that you as aliens and strangers abstain from fleshly lust desires, which causes conflict in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Maintain fine behavior among the nations. That way when they speak badly about you, they may see your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation inspection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake: whether it is to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It is Gods will that you do the right things and that this will silence the ignorance of foolish men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be free, and yet do not use your freedom for a covering for evil, but as servants of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Reverence and respect God. Honor the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle master but also to the hard to please.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For this is to your credit to suffer wrongfully and endure grief because of your conscience toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>What value is there when you sin, and are buffeted for it, you take it patiently? But if, when you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this you were called because Christ also suffered for you. He left you an example a copy for imitationa model that you should follow in his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He committed no sin and deception was not found in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he was reviled insulted, he did not revile in return. When he suffered he did not threaten, but committed himself to him that judges righteously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He bore our sins in his body upon the stake, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness. You were healed because of his wounds stripes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were straying like sheep. But now you have returned to your shepherd and overseer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
