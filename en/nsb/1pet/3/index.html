Even if your husband does not obey Gods word, he may be won without a word by observing the way you live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Your husband could see your chaste behavior coupled with respect reverence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Your appearance should not come from the outward adornment, things like braiding the hair, and wearing jewels of gold, or wearing fine apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let your appearance be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. This is of great value in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The holy women of old, who hoped in God, adorned themselves this way, being submissive to their own husbands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You are her children now, if you do what is right and are not fearful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the same way, you husbands live with your wives in an understanding way. Honor the woman as the weaker vessel. For you are joint-heirs of the grace of life. May your prayers not be hindered cut-offblocked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, all of you be like-minded, compassionate, brotherly, tenderhearted, and humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not repay evil for evil, or insult for insult. Do just the opposite. For you were called to inherit a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whoever would love life and see good days should keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let him turn away from evil, and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The eyes of Jehovah God are upon the righteous. His ears hear their prayers. But the face person of Jehovah is against those who do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who will harm you if you are eager to do good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even if you suffer for righteousness sake, you are blessed. Do not fear! Do not be troubled distressedintimidated!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Sanctify the Christ as Lord kurios: master in your hearts. Always be ready to answer every man who asks you a reason for your hope, yet with meekness mildness and respect!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Keep a good conscience. When you are spoken against, those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is better to suffer for doing what is right, if suffering is Gods will, than to suffer for doing evil wrongsin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God.

Yet God waited patiently in the days of Noah. But few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This was a symbol pointing to baptism, which now saves you. It is not the washing off of bodily dirt, but the promise made to God for a good conscience. It saves you through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He is in heaven at the right hand of God, ruling over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
