I too am an older man and a witness of the sufferings of Christ. I am also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Shepherd the flock of God in your care. Exercise the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to the will of God. Do not do it for dishonest gain, but eagerly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do not lord it over your charge, but make yourselves examples to the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Likewise, you younger men, be subject to the older men.
