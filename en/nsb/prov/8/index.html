Does understanding direct her voice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>She takes her stand on top of high places and in the street intersections.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>She cries out at the gates, at the entrance by the doors:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I call to you men. My voice is to the sons of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»O you simple ones, understand wisdom and, you fools, be of an understanding heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Listen for I speak of excellent things. The truth comes from my lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»My mouth will speak truth! Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»All my speech is righteous. Nothing crooked or perverse comes from my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»They are all straight talk to him who understands. It is proper to those who find knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Receive my instruction and not silver. Take knowledge rather than choice gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»For wisdom is better than pearls. Nothing desirable compares to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Wisdom dwells with discretion and it finds knowledge and sound judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Respect for Jehovah means to hate evil. I hate: pride, and arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I understand and I am very strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Kings reign by me, and princes decree justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I love those who love me. Those who earnestly seek me will find me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Riches and honor are with me. Yes, durable riches and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»My fruit is better than gold, yes, better than fine gold. My yield is better than choice silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth. I will fill their treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Jehovah created me in the beginning of his way, before his works of antiquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»I was made from long ago, before the earth began.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»When there were no depths or fountains abounding with water, I was brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Before the mountains were settled, before the hills I was brought forth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»He had not made the earth or the fields or the highest part of the dust of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»When he prepared the heavens, I was there. When he circled the face of the deep:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»When he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the fountains of the deep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his command, when he appointed the foundations of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Then I was beside him, as a master workman with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»I rejoiced in the inhabited earth. My delights were with the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Listen to me, my children: for blessed are those who practice my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Hear instruction, do not refuse it and be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Blessed is the man who listens to me. He watches daily at my gates, waiting at my doorposts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Those who find me find life. They will receive favor from Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»But he who sins against me wrongs himself. All who hate me love death.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
