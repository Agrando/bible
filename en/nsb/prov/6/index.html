You are captured by the words of your mouth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You are now in the power of that person. Here is what you should do: Go and beg for permission to call off the agreement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do this before you fall asleep. Do not allow your eyes to close.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Deliver your self like a deer from the hand of the hunter, and like a bird from the hand of the fowler bird catcher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Go to the ant, you lazy person. Consider her ways and be wise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lowly ant has no guide or overseer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It prepares its food in the summer and gathers food at the harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How long will you sleep, O lazy person?
