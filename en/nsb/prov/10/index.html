He rejects the mischief of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He becomes poor who deals with a lazy hand. The hand of the diligent makes rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who gathers in summer is a wise son. He who sleeps at the harvest is a son who causes shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessings cover the head of the righteous. Violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The memory of the righteous is blessed.
