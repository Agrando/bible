He that hates reproof is stupid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A good man obtains favor from Jehovah. He will condemn a man of wicked intentions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A man will not stand firm on sin. The root of the righteous will not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A virtuous wife is a crown to her husband. She who acts shameful is rottenness in his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The thoughts of the righteous are just. The counsels of the wicked are deceitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright delivers them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The wicked are overthrown and are no more. The house of the righteous will stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A man is commended according to his wisdom. He with a perverse heart will be despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He with a servant who is lightly esteemed is better off than he who has no food and yet is honored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A righteous man has regard for the life of his animal, but the compassion of the wicked is terrible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who tills his land will have plenty of bread. He who follows worthless people lacks sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked desires the booty of evil men, but the root of the righteous yields fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips. The righteous will depart from trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth. The deeds of a man's hands will return to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes. He who listens to counsel is wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A fool's anger is instantly known. A prudent man conceals shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who speaks truth shows righteousness, but a false witness deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword. The tongue of the wise brings a cure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The lip of truth will be established forever. A lying tongue is only for a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Deceit is in the heart of those who contrive evil, but the counselors of peace have joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No evil will happen to the righteous. The wicked will be filled with trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah. Those who deal truly are his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A prudent man conceals knowledge. The heart of fools proclaims foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The hand of the diligent will bear rule. The lazy will be under forced labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Anxiety in the heart of man make it heavy, but a good word makes it glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The righteous is a guide to his neighbor. The way of the wicked leads others astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The lazy man does not cook what he took in hunting. The substance of a diligent man is precious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The way of righteousness is life. In its pathway there is no death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
