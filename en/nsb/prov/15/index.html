Harsh words stir up anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The tongue of the wise uses knowledge properly. The mouth of fools pours out foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The eyes of Jehovah are in everywhere watching the evil and the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A wholesome tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it destroys life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A fool despises his father's instruction, but he who accepts discipline is prudent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is treasure in the house of the righteous. The earnings of the wicked bring trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lips of the wise disperse knowledge, the heart of the foolish does not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah! The prayer of the upright is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The way of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah. He loves the one who follows after righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Correction is severe for the person who forsakes the way. He who hates reproof will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The grave and destruction are before in front ofin the presence of Jehovah. How much more in the hearts of men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A scoffer hates the one who reproves him. He will not go to the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A merry heart makes a cheerful countenance. The spirit is broken by sorrow of the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The heart of one with understanding seeks knowledge. The mouth of fools feeds on foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All the days of the afflicted are evil. He who has a merry heart has a continual feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It is better to have a little with respect for Jehovah than great treasure and trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Better is a bowel of soup where there is love, than a steak with someone you hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>An angry man stirs up strife. The slow to anger calms disputes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of the lazy is as a hedge of thorns. But the way of the righteous is a wide path.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A wise son makes a father glad. A foolish man despises his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Folly is joy to the destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walks uprightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Without counsel plans fail. But in the multitude of counselors they are established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man has joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken at the right time, how good it is!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The way of life leads upward for the wise. That he may depart from the grave beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehovah will destroy the house of the proud and he will establish the border of the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to Jehovah.

But he who hates gifts will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The heart of the righteous studies how to answer. The mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jehovah is far from the wicked. He hears the prayer of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The light of the eyes rejoices the heart: and a good report makes the bones healthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The ear that hears the reproof of life abides among the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who refuses instruction discipline despises his own life. But he who listens to reproof understands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Respect for Jehovah teaches wisdom. Before glory there is humility.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
