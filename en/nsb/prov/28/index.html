But a man of understanding and knowledge remains for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A poor man that oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain that leaves no food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They who forsake the law praise the wicked. Those who obey the law oppose them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Evil men do not understand justice. Those who seek Jehovah understand all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better is the poor man who walks in uprightness, than the rich man who is perverse in his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who obeys the law is a wise son. But he who is a companion of worthless men shames his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who becomes wealthy through unfair loans and interest collects them for the one who pitys the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The prayer of the person who will not listen to the law is disgusting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whoever leads decent people into evil will fall into his own pit. Innocent people will inherit good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A rich person is wise in his own eyes, but the poor who has understanding, sees right through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When righteous people rejoice, there is great glory, but when wicked people rise, people hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The man who covers his sins will not be blessed; but whoever confesses and leaves them will have mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blessed is the man reverencing God. He who hardens his heart will fall into trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Like a roaring lion and a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler over the helpless people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The ruler who lacks understanding is a great oppressor. He who hates covetousness will prolong his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A violent and bloodthirsty man will run to the pit; let no man help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoever walks blamelessly will be saved: but he who is perverse in his ways will fall at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He who tills his land will have plenty of bread. He who follows after vain persons will have poverty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A faithful man will have many blessings. But he who hurries to be rich will not go unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is not good to show partiality for a man will transgress for a piece of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He who hurries to be rich has an evil eye. He does not think poverty will come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who reproves a man later find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whoever robs his father or mother, and says: »It is no transgression;« the same is the companion of a man who destroys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The person with a proud heart stirs up discord. The person who trusts Jehovah will prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who trusts in his own heart is a fool. He who walks wisely will be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who gives to the poor will not lack. But he who hides his eyes will have many curses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When the wicked rise people hide, but when they die, the righteous increase.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
