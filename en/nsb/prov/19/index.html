The liar will not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Many ask favors of the prince. Every man is a friend of a person who gives gifts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The brothers of the poor hate him. His friends leave him. He pursues them with words but they do not listen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who acquires wisdom loves life.
