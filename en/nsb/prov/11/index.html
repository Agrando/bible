A perfect weight is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Pride comes and then comes shame. Wisdom is with the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The integrity of the upright will guide them. The perverseness of transgressors will destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Riches do not profit in the day of wrath. Righteousness delivers from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Righteousness of the undefiled man of integrity directs his way! Wickedness causes the evil to fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Righteousness will deliver the upright. Greed will capture the unfaithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When a wicked man dies his expectation perishes, indeed the hope of unjust men perishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The righteous is delivered from trouble. The wicked goes in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A godless hypocrite destroys his neighbor with his mouth. The righteous will be delivered through knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The city rejoices when all goes well with the righteous. There is joyful shouting when the wicked perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The city is exalted by the blessing of the upright. The mouth of the wicked ruins the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who is void of wisdom despises his neighbor, but a man of understanding holds his peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A talebearer reveals secrets. He that is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The people fall where there is no counsel. Yes, the people fall but in the multitude of counselors there is safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that is surety for a stranger will suffer. He that hates being surety is sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A gracious woman retains honor. Ruthless and violent men retain riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The merciful man does himself good. The cruel man troubles his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The wicked works a deceitful work. There is a sure reward for the one who sows righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Righteousness leads to life and he that pursues evil participates in his own death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Those who are of a perverse heart are abomination to Jehovah. The way of the upright is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hand in hand united, the wicked shall not be unpunished; but the descendants of the righteous will be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A beautiful woman who lacks discretion is like a jewel of gold in a swine's snout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is intense anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is one who scatters, and yet increases. There is one who withholds what is due and it leads to poverty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The liberal person will prosper. He who waters will be watered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who withholds corn from the people will be cursed. Blessing will be on the head of him that sells it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who diligently seeks good procures favor. He who seeks evil, evil will come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He who trusts in his riches will fall. The righteous will flourish as a leaf on a branch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind. The fool will serve the wise of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. He who gains life is wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The righteous will be rewarded on the earth much more than the wicked and the sinner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
