And what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do not give your strength to women. Do not give your ways to that which destroys kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It is not for kings, O Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to desire strong drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will drink and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish, and wine to those who are bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let him drink and forget his poverty. Let him remember his misery no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Open your mouth for the dumb in the cause of all who are appointed to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Open your mouth and judge righteously. Plead the cause of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who can find a virtuous woman? For her value is far above corals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The heart of her husband safely trusts her. He will have no lack of gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>She seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She is like the merchants' ships for she brings her food from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household, and a portion to her maidens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She considers a field and buys it. With the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She fortifies herself with strength and strengthens her arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She perceives that her merchandise is good. Her candle does not go out at night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>She stretches her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>She stretches out her hand to the poor. Yes, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>She is not afraid of the snow for her household. All her household is clothed with scarlet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>She makes herself coverings of tapestry. Her clothing is silk and purple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>She makes fine linen and sells it. She supplies sashes for the merchants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Strength and honor are her clothing. She will rejoice in time to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She opens her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she speaks kind things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She watches over her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Her children arise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Many daughters have done well, but you are above them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain. But a woman who respects Jehovah will be praised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Give her of the fruit of her hands. Let her own works praise her in the gates.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
