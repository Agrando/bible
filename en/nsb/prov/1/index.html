To discern and understand words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>To receive instruction with wisdom, justice, judgment and integrity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>To give wisdom and refinement to the simple. To the young man knowledge and discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A wise man will hear and will increase learning. A man of understanding will procure wise counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This will help him understand a proverb and the interpretation as well as the words of the wise and their riddles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Respect for Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge truthunderstandingwisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My son, listen to the instruction of your father. Do not forsake the law of your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Discipline and education are a graceful ornament on your head, and a golden chain around your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My son, if sinners tempt you do not consent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If they say: »Come with us. Let us lie in wait to kill someone. Let us ambush the innocent without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Let us swallow them alive and whole just as the grave does, and just as the dead go into the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»We will find precious material possessions and we fill our houses with plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Throw in with us. Let us all have one purse.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My son, do not walk in the way with them. Withhold your food from their path!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They lie in wait for their own blood murder. They set an ambush for their own lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust dishonest gain. Greed takes away the life of its owner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wisdom calls you! She raises her voice in the streets and marketplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>She calls in the streets, in the opening of the gates: in the city she utters her words. She says:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»How long, you simple stupidfoolish ones, will you love simplicity foolishnessstupidity? The scoffers delight in scoffing.

I will make my words known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I called you! I stretched out my hand to you. You paid no attention to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»You have ignored all my counsel. You accept no correction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I also will laugh at your trouble. I will mock when your fear comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Trouble and distress will surround you like a whirlwind, like a great storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»You will ask for my help, but I will not listen. You will search, but you will not find me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»You have no use for knowledge and you refuse to respect Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»You rejected my advice and paid no attention when I warned you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Now you will get what you deserve for what you have done. Your own advice will make you sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Sin and self-satisfaction bring destruction and death to stupid fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Whoever listens to me will be secure and will be free from the fear of evil.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
