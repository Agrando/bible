Listen to my understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>That way you will maintain discretion and your lips will keep knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The lips of an immoral woman drip as a honeycomb. Her mouth is smoother than oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two edged sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Her feet go down to death. Her steps take hold of the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She does not ponder the path of life. Her unstable ways she does not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hear me now my son. Do not depart from the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Keep far away from her. Do not go near the door of her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You will give your honor majesty to others and your years to the cruel one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Strangers will be filled with your financial strength. Strangers will benefit from your hard work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You mourn at last, when your flesh and your body are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You say: »How I have hated instruction! My heart despised reproof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I did not obey the voice of my teachers. I did not listen to my instructors!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I was very near total ruin in the midst of the congregation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Drink water from your own cistern. Drink running water from your own well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Should your waters overflow in the streets, like streams of water in public places?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let them be yours alone. Do not share with strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let your fountain be blessed. Rejoice with the wife of your youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>She is like a loving deer and a graceful doe. Let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Always be delighted with her love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Why will you be intimate with an immoral woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah. He ponders all his paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>His own iniquities will catch the wicked. He will be held with the cords of his sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He dies without instruction. He goes astray because of his foolishness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
