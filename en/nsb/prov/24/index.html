It is established by understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Knowledge fills the rooms with all precious and pleasant riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A wise man is strong. A man of knowledge increases strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You wage war with the help of wise guidance. There is victory in a multitude of counselors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wisdom is too exalted lofty for a fool. He does not open his mouth at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who devises plans to do evil is called a troublemaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The thought of foolishness is sin. The mocker is an abomination to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you fail in time of trouble your strength is small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If you do not deliver those who are condemned to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You may say: »We did not know this,« but God knows and judges your motives. He keeps watch on you and knows. He will reward each man according to his deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My son, eat honey because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to your taste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The knowledge of wisdom is sweet to you. When you find the knowledge of wisdom there is a reward. Your hope will not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous. Do not destroy his resting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A righteous man falls seven times and rises up again. but the wicked will fall by evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not rejoice when your enemy falls. Do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah will see it and be displeased and turn his anger away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not worry about evil people. Do not envy the wicked!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There is no reward for the evil man! The candle of the wicked will be put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, respect Jehovah and the king. Do not associate with those who want to change things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Their calamity will rise suddenly! Who knows the ruin from both of them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These sayings belong to the wise. It is not good to show partiality in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The people curse and the nations abhor the man who says to the wicked, »You are righteous.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Those who rebuke the wicked are filled with delight. A good blessing will come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He kisses the lips that give the right answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Prepare your outside work. Make it fit for yourself in the field. After that build your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do not witness against your neighbor without cause. Do not deceive with you lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Do not say: »I will do to him as he has done to me. I will render to the man according to his work.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I went by the field of the lazy man, and by the vineyard of the man lacking understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It was all grown over with thorns and nettles, and the wall of stone was broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then I saw, and considered it well. I looked on it, and received instruction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Your poverty will come like a robber and your want like an armed man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
