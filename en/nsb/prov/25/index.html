The bad report about you will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise provider to a listening ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to those who send him. He refreshes his masters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He who falsely boasts of a gift is like clouds and wind without rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A ruler is persuaded by patience, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have you found honey? Eat only what is needed or you will be too full and vomit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Withdraw your foot from your neighbor's house; or he will tire of you and hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Like the man does not wear a coat in winter, or like vinegar on soda, so is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat. If he is thirsty, give him water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You will heap coals of fire upon his head, and Jehovah will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The north wind drives away rain. So does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than to share the house with a contentious woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As cold waters to a thirsty man, so is good news from a far country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is not good to eat too much honey. To seek ones own glory is not glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He who cannot control his own spirit life is as helpless as a city without walls, open to trouble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
