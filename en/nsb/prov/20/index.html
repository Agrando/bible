Strong drink leads to brawls. He who is intoxicated by it is not wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Fear of a king is like the roar of a lion. Provoke him to anger and sin against yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>It is an honor for a man to cease from discord. Only fools start quarrels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The lazy man will not plow because of the cold. He will beg during harvest and have nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water and a man of understanding will draw it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Most men proclaim their own loyalty; but who can find a trustworthy man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The righteous man walks in his integrity. He blesses his children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When a king sits on the throne of judgment he scatters away evil with his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Who can say: »I have made my heart clean. I am pure from my sin?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Differing weights and differing measures, both of them are an abomination to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even a child is known by his deeds, whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The hearing ear and the seeing eye, Jehovah made them both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not love sleep or you will come to poverty. Open your eyes and be satisfied with bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Good for nothing,« cries the buyer. But when he goes his way he boasts about the purchase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is gold and a multitude of rubies, but the lips that speak knowledge are more precious than jewels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take his garment that is surety for a stranger and hold it as a pledge for a seductress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Bread taken by deceit tastes sweet to a man. Afterwards his mouth will be filled with gravel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Good counsel makes for good plans. Seek good counsel if you wage war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A gossip reveals secrets. So avoid a man who speaks flattering words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who curses his father or his mother, his lamp will be put out in obscure darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but in the end it will not be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do not say: »I will recompense evil.« Instead wait on Jehovah, and he will save you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Many and different weights are an abomination to Jehovah and a false balance is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jehovah directs mans steps. How can man understand his own way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is dangerous to make a vow to God before counting the cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A wise king sifts out the wicked. He rolls the threshing wheel over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The breath of man is the candle of Jehovah, searching all the inward parts of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Loving-kindness and truth preserve the king and his throne is upheld by loving-kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The glory of young men is their strength. The honor of old men is their gray haired wisdom and experience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It takes a painful experience to cleanse our hearts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
