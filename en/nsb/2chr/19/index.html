He said to him: »Do you think it is right to help those who are wicked and to take the side of those who hate Jehovah? What you have done has brought Jehovahs anger upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Regardless of this, there is some good in you. You have removed all the symbols of the goddess Asherah that people worshiped. You have tried to follow Gods will.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>While Jehoshaphat was living in Jerusalem, he regularly went to the people between Beersheba and the mountains of Ephraim. He brought the people back to Jehovah the God of their ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He appointed judges in the country, in each fortified city of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He told the judges: »Be careful when you make your decisions in court.

Then your relatives will not become guilty in front of Jehovah. Otherwise, he will become angry with you and your relatives. Do this and you will not be guilty of anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The chief priest Amariah will be in charge of you in every matter involving Jehovah. Zebadiah, who is the son of Ishmael and the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be in charge of every matter involving the king. The Levites will serve as officers of the court. Be strong and do your job. May Jehovah be with those who do right.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
