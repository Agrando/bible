He set up camp to attack the fortified cities. He intended to conquer them himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to wage war against Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He and his officers and military staff made plans to stop the water from flowing out of the springs outside the city. They helped him do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A large crowd gathered as they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land. They said: Why should the kings of Assyria find plenty of water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hezekiah worked hard. He rebuilt all the broken sections of the wall. He built the towers taller and built another wall outside the city wall. He strengthened the Millo in the City of David, and made plenty of weapons and shields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He appointed military commanders over the troops and gathered the commanders in the square by the city gate. He spoke these words of encouragement:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened or terrified by the king of Assyria or the crowd with him. Someone greater is on our side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah our God fights on our side. The Assyrians must rely on human power alone. These words encouraged the army of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Sennacherib and his troops were camped at the town of Lachish. He sent a message to Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem. It said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I am King Sennacherib of Assyria. I have Jerusalem surrounded. Do you think you can survive my attack?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Hezekiah your king is telling you that Jehovah your God will save you from me. But he is lying! You will die of hunger and thirst.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Did Hezekiah not tear down all except one of Jehovahs altars and places of worship? And did he not tell you people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»You have heard what my ancestors and I have done to other nations. Were the gods of those nations able to defend their land against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»None of those gods kept their people safe from the kings of Assyria. Do you really think your God can do any better?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Do not be fooled by Hezekiah! No god of any nation has been able to stand up to Assyria. Believe me, your God cannot keep you safe!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Sennacheribs officers said more against Jehovah God and his servant Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sennacherib wrote letters cursing Jehovah the God of Israel. These letters said: The gods of the nations in other countries could not rescue their people from me. Hezekiahs God cannot rescue his people from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Sennacheribs officers shouted loudly in the Judean language to the troops who were on the wall of Jerusalem. They tried to frighten and terrify the troops so that they could capture the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as if he were one of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of the hands of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, prayed about this and called to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah sent an angel who exterminated all the soldiers, officials, and commanders in the Assyrian kings camp. Sennacherib was humiliated and returned to his own country. When he went into the temple of his god, some of his own sons killed him with a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem from King Sennacherib of Assyria and from everyone else. Jehovah gave them peace with all their neighbors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Many people still went to Jerusalem to bring gifts to Jehovah and expensive presents to King Hezekiah of Judah. From that point in history he was considered important by all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hezekiah became sick and was about to die. He prayed to Jehovah, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Hezekiah was conceited. So he did not repay Jehovah for his kindness. Jehovah became angry with him, with Judah, and with Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem humbled themselves when they realized they had become conceited. Thus Jehovah did not vent his anger on them during Hezekiahs time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Hezekiah became richer and was highly honored. He prepared storehouses for himself to hold silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He built storehouses for the produce of grain and wine and oil; and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He made towns for himself. He gathered much property in flocks and herds: for God had given him great wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It was Hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of Gihon stopped, and the water taken down on the west side of the town of David. Hezekiah did well in everything he tried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the leaders of Babylon sent ambassadors to ask him about the miraculous sign that had happened in the land, God left him. God did this to test him, to find out everything that was in Hezekiahs heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Everything else about Hezekiah, including his devotion to God, is written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, and in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hezekiah slept in death with his ancestors. He was buried in the upper tombs of Davids descendants. When Hezekiah died, all of Judah and the people in Jerusalem honored him. His son Manasseh succeeded him as king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
