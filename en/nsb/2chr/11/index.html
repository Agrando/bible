There were one hundred and eighty thousand of the best soldiers, to fight against Israel and return the kingdom to Rehoboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God spoke his word to Shemaiah, the man of God. He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Speak to Judahs King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, and all Israel in Judah and Benjamin.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehovah says: »Do not wage war against your relatives. Everyone, go home. What has happened is my doing.« So they obeyed the word of Jehovah. They turned back from their attack on Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem. He built fortified cities in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He rebuilt Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He strengthened the cities and put army officers with reserves of food, olive oil, and wine in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He stored shields and spears in each city. He made the cities very secure. Rehoboam held on to Judah and Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The priests and Levites in every region of Israel aligned with Rehoboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The priests abandoned their land and property and went to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his descendants rejected them as Jehovahs priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As an alternative, Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the illegal worship sites and the goat and calf statues he had made as idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>People from every tribe of Israel who were determined to seek Jehovah the true God of Israel followed the Levitical priests to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah God of their ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah by supporting Rehoboam, son of Solomon, for three years. During those three years they lived the way David and Solomon had lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth. Jerimoth was the son of David and Abihail. Abihail was the daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Mahalath gave birth to the following sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After marrying Mahalath, he married Maacah, Absaloms granddaughter. She gave birth to Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Rehoboam loved Maacah, Absaloms granddaughter, more than all his other wives and concubines. He had eighteen wives and sixty concubines. He fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Rehoboam appointed Abijah, son of Maacah, as family head and prince among his brothers. By doing this, Rehoboam could make him king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He wisely placed his sons in every region of Judah and Benjamin, in every fortified city. He gave them allowances and obtained many wives for them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
