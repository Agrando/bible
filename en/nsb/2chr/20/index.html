The crowd is already in Hazazon Tamar En Gedi.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehoshaphat was frightened and decided to ask for Jehovahs help. He announced a fast throughout Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The people of Judah gathered to seek Jehovahs help. They came from every city in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the new courtyard at Jehovahs Temple, Jehoshaphat stood in front of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He prayed aloud: »O Jehovah, God of our ancestors, you rule in heaven over all the nations of the world. You are powerful and mighty. No one can oppose you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You are our God. When your people Israel moved into this land, you drove out the people who were living here and gave the land to the descendants of Abraham, your friend, to be theirs from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Our ancestors lived in this land and built a Temple to honor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»They believed that whenever this land is struck by war, judgement, disease, or famine, your people can pray to you at the Temple. You will hear their prayer and save them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»You can see that the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Edom are attacking us! Those are the nations you would not let our ancestors invade on their way from Egypt. Consequently these nations were not destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»They are now paying us back by coming to force us out of your land that you gave to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»You are our God. Will you judge them? We do not have the strength to face this large crowd that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, so we are looking to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the people from Judah, their infants, wives, and children were standing in front of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jehovahs Spirit came to Jahaziel. He was the son of Zechariah, grandson of Benaiah, great-grandson of Jeiel, whose father was Mattaniah, a Levite descended from Asaph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jahaziel said: »Pay attention to me, everyone from Judah, everyone living in Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat. This is what Jehovah says to you: Do not be frightened or terrified by this large crowd. The battle is not yours. It is Gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Attack them tomorrow as they come up the pass at Ziz. Meet them at the end of the valley that leads to the wild country near Jeruel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»You will not have to fight this battle. Just take up your positions and wait. You will see Jehovah give you victory. People of Judah and Jerusalem, do not hesitate or be afraid. Go out to battle. Jehovah will be with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low. His face was touching the ground. All the people bowed with him and worshiped Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The members of the Levite clans of Kohath and Korah stood up and with a loud shout praised Jehovah, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Early the next morning the people went out to the wild country near Tekoa. Before they began Jehoshaphat addressed them with these words: People of Judah and Jerusalem! Put your trust in Jehovah your God. You will stand your ground. Believe what his prophets tell you, and you will succeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»After consulting with the people, the king ordered some musicians to put on the robes they wore on sacred occasions and to march ahead of the army. They sang: Praise Jehovah! His love is eternal!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As soon as they began singing, Jehovah confused the enemy camp,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Ammonite and Moabite troops attacked and completely destroyed those from Edom. Then they turned against each other and fought until the entire camp was wiped out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judahs army reached the tower that overlooked the desert. They saw that every soldier in the enemys army was lying dead on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehoshaphat and his troops came to take the loot. They found among them a lot of goods, clothes, and valuables. They found more than they could carry. They spent three days collecting the loot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They gathered in the valley of Beracah on the fourth day. Because they thanked Jehovah there, that place is still called the »Valley of Beracah« Thanks today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned to Jerusalem. They rejoiced while Jehoshaphat led them. Jehovah gave them a reason to rejoice about what had happened to their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They brought harps, lyres, and trumpets to Jehovahs Temple in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Deep respect for Jehovah came over the kingdoms in that area when they heard how Jehovah waged war against Israels enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jehoshaphats kingdom was peaceful, since his God surrounded him with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jehoshaphat ruled as king of Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to rule. He ruled for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jehoshaphat carefully followed the example his father Asa had set and did what Jehovah considered right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>However the illegal worship sites on the hills were not torn down. The people still did not have their hearts set on the God of their ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Everything else about Jehoshaphat from first to last is written in the records of Jehu, son of Hanani, which is included in the Book of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>After this, King Jehoshaphat of Judah allied himself with King Ahaziah of Israel, who led him to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jehoshaphat joined him in making ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Eliezer was the son of Dodavahu from Mareshah. He prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said: »Jehovah will destroy your work because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah.« The ships were wrecked and could not go to Tarshish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
