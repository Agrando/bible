It was thirty feet square and fifteen feet high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He also made a round tank molten sea of copper. It was seven and one half feet deep, fifteen feet in diameter, and forty-five feet in circumference.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of decorations, one above the other. The decorations were in the shape of bulls. They had been cast all in one piece with the rest of the tank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The tank rested on the backs of twelve copper bulls that faced outward. Three faced in each direction, north, west, south and east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The sides of the tank were three inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, curving outward like the petals of a flower. The tank held about fifteen thousand gallons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They also made ten basins, five to be placed on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. They were to be used to rinse the parts of the animals that were burned as sacrifices. The water in the large tank was for the priests to use for washing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They made ten gold lamp stands according to the usual pattern, and ten tables, and placed them in the main room of the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He made ten tables and put them in the temple. Five were on the south side and five on the north side. And he made one hundred gold bowls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He also made the priests courtyard and the large courtyard and its doors. He covered the doors with copper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He set the pool on the south side in the southeast corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Huram also made the pots, shovels, and bowls. So Huram finished the work for King Solomon in Gods Temple:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Two pillars, bowl-shaped crowns on top of the two pillars, and two sets of filigree to cover the two bowl-shaped crowns on top of the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of filigree two rows of pomegranates for each filigree to cover the two bowl-shaped crowns on the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>ten stands and ten basins on the stands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>one pool and the twelve bulls under it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>pots, shovels, and three-pronged forks. Huram Hiram-abiv made all of them out of polished copper for Jehovahs Temple at King Solomons request.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The king cast them in foundries in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Solomon made so many of these products that no one tried to determine how much the copper weighed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Solomon made all the furnishings for Gods Temple: the gold altar, the gold tables on which the bread of the presence was placed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>lamp stands and lamps of pure gold to burn as directed in front of the inner room,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>flowers, lamps, pure gold tongs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>snuffers, basins, dishes, incense burners of pure gold, the gold entrance to the temple, the gold doors of the most holy place, and the gold doors of the Temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
