Jehovah, his God, was with him and made him very powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Solomon spoke to all Israel. He spoke to the commanders of regiments and battalions, judges, every prince, and to the heads of Israels families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Solomon and the entire assembly went to the place of worship in Gibeon because Gods Tent of Meeting was there. Jehovahs servant Moses pitched the tent in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David already brought Gods Ark from Kiriath Jearim to a place he had prepared for it. He pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The copper altar that Bezalel, son of Uri and grandson of Hur built was in front of Jehovahs Tent. There Solomon and the assembly worshiped Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Solomon went to the copper altar in front of the Tent of Meeting and in Jehovahs presence sacrificed one thousand burnt offerings on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That night God appeared to Solomon. He said: »What do you want me to I give you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Solomon answered: »You always showed great love for my father David. Now you have allowed me to succeed him as king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»O Jehovah my God, fulfill the promise you made to my father David. You have made me king over a people, who are so many that they cannot be counted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Please give me the wisdom and knowledge I need to rule over them. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God replied to Solomon: »You have made the right choice. Instead of asking for wealth, treasure, fame or the death of your enemies or even for long life for yourself, you have asked for wisdom and knowledge so that you can rule my people, over whom I have made you king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»For this reason I will give you wisdom and knowledge. And in addition, I will give you more wealth, treasure, and fame than any king has ever had before or will ever have again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Solomon left the place of worship at Gibeon, where the Tent of Jehovahs presence was, and returned to Jerusalem. There he ruled over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Solomon assembled a force of fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem. The rest he stationed in various other cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>During his reign silver and gold became as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Solomons merchants bought his string of horses and chariots in the regions of Musri and Kue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They imported each chariot from Egypt for fifteen pounds of silver and each horse for six ounces of silver. For the same price they obtained horses to export to all the Hittite and Syrian kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
