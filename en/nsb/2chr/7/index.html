They worshiped and praised Jehovah. They said: »He is good; his mercy lovingkindness endures forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>King Solomon offered twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep as sacrifices to Jehovah. Thus the king and all the people dedicated Gods Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The priests were standing at their posts. So were the Levites who had Jehovahs musical instruments that King David made for praising Jehovah. They were saying: »his mercy endures forever.« This he used to offer praise. The priests were opposite the Levites blowing trumpets while all Israel was standing there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Solomon designated the courtyard in front of Jehovahs Temple as a holy place. He sacrificed the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat because the copper altar that he had made and that was in front of Jehovah was not able to hold all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Booths. A very large crowd came from the territory between the border of Hamath and the River of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There was an assembly on the eighth day. They observed the dedication of the altar for seven days and celebrated the festival for another seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Solomon dismissed the people to their tents on the twenty-third day of the seventh month. They rejoiced with cheerful hearts for all the blessings Jehovah had given David, Solomon, and his people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Solomon finished Jehovahs Temple and the royal palace and completed everything he had in mind for Jehovahs Temple and his own palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>JEHOVAH APPEARED TO SOLOMON THAT NIGHT. He said to Solomon: »I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a Temple for sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I may shut the sky so that there is no rain, or command grasshoppers to devour the countryside, or send an epidemic among my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»However, if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, pray, search for me, and turn from their evil ways, I will hear their prayer from heaven, forgive their sins, and heal their country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»My eyes will be open! My ears will pay attention to the prayers offered at this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I have chosen and declared this Temple holy so that my name may be placed there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»If you will be faithful to me as your father David was, do everything I command, and obey my laws and rules,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I will establish your royal dynasty just as I said in a promise to your father David, when I said: You will never fail to have an heir ruling over Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»On the other hand, if you and your descendants turn away from me and abandon my commandments and laws that I gave you, and follow and serve other gods and worship them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I will uproot Israel from the land I gave them. I will reject this Temple that I declared holy for my name. I will make it an example and an object of ridicule for all the people of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Everyone passing by this impressive Temple will be appalled. They will ask: Why did Jehovah do these things to this land and to this Temple?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»They will answer their own question: They abandoned Jehovah the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt. They adopted other gods, worshiped, and served them. That is why he brought this disaster on them.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
