But because Jehoram was the oldest, Jehoshaphat made him his successor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehoram was in firm control of the kingdom. He had all his brothers killed, and also some Israelite officials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehoram became king at the age of thirty-two. He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He followed the wicked example of King Ahab and the other kings of Israel. He married one of Ahabs daughters. He sinned against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jehovah was not willing to destroy the dynasty of David. This is because he made a covenant with David and promised that his descendants would always continue to rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>During Jehorams time Edom rebelled against Judah and chose its own king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehoram took all his chariot commanders to attack. The Edomites and their chariot commanders surrounded him. He got up during the night and broke through their lines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Edom rebelled against Judahs rule and is still independent today. At the same time Edom rebelled, Libnah rebelled because Jehoram had abandoned Jehovah the God of his ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehoram made illegal places of worship in the hills of Judah. This caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes. So he led Judah astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A letter came to him from the prophet Elijah. It read: This is what Jehovah the God of your ancestor David says: You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of King Asa of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Instead, you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel. You, like Ahabs family, have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes. You have killed your brothers, your fathers family. Your brothers were better than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah will strike a great blow to your people, your sons, your wives, and all your property because you did this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You will be affected by a painful stomach disease and suffer until you die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Later Jehovah caused the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Ethiopians to become angry with Jehoram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They invaded Judah and stole the royal property from the palace. They led Jehorams wives and sons away as prisoners. The only one left behind was Ahaziah, his youngest son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>After this happened; Jehovah struck Jehoram with an incurable stomach disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Two years later Jehoram died in terrible pain. No bonfire was built to honor him. The people had done this for his ancestors, but not him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king. He ruled eight years from Jerusalem. He died, and no one even felt sad. He was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
