So she came to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She arrived with a large group of servants. They had camels carrying spices, a large quantity of gold, and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Solomon answered all her questions. No question was too difficult for Solomon to answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When the queen of Sheba saw Solomons wisdom, the palace he built,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>the food on his table, his officers seating arrangement, the organization of his officials and the uniforms they wore, his cupbearers and their uniforms, and the burnt offerings that he sacrificed at Jehovahs Temple, she was breathless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>She told the king: »What I heard in my country about your words and your wisdom is true!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I did not believe the reports until I came and saw it with my own eyes. I was not even told about half of the extent of your wisdom. You have surpassed the stories I heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Your men are indeed blessed! Your servants are truly blessed. It is because they are always stationed near you and listen to your wisdom!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I thank Jehovah your God, who is pleased with you. He has put you on his throne to be king on behalf of Jehovah your God. Because of your Gods love for the people of Israel, he has established them permanently and made you king over them so that you would maintain justice and righteousness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The queen gave the king nine thousand pounds of gold, a very large quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never was there such a large quantity of spices in Israel as those that the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hurams servants and Solomons servants who brought gold from Ophir also brought sandalwood and precious stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>With the sandalwood the king made gateways to Jehovahs Temple and the royal palace. They also made lyres and harps for the singers. No one had ever seen anything like them in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba anything she wanted. Whatever she asked for, more than what she had brought him. Then she and her servants went back to her country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The gold that came to Solomon in one year weighed forty nine thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>not counting the gold that the merchants and traders brought. All the Arab kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold, using fifteen pounds of gold on each shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, using seven and one half pounds of gold on each shield. The king put them in the hall named the Forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>King Solomon also made a large ivory throne and covered it with pure gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Six steps led to the throne. It had a gold footstool attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat. Two lions stood beside the armrests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Twelve lions stood on six steps, one on each side. Nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All King Solomons cups were gold. All the utensils for the hall named the Forest of Lebanon were fine gold. Silver was not considered valuable in Solomons time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The king had ships going to Tarshish with Hurams sailors. Once every three years the Tarshish ships would bring gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>King Solomon was greater in wealth and wisdom than all the other kings of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All the kings of the world wanted to listen to the wisdom that God gave Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Everyone who came brought him gifts such as articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This happened year after year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand war horses. He stationed some in chariot cities and others with himself in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the country of the Philistines and as far as the Egyptian border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones. He made cedars as plentiful as fig trees in the foothills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all other countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The rest of the acts of Solomon from first to last are written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah from Shiloh, and in Iddo the seers visions about Jeroboam son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Solomon lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
