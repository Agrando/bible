That is where Jehovah appeared to his father David. David had prepared the site on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He began to build on the second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. It was in the place David had povided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is how Solomon laid the foundation to build Gods Temple. It was ninety feet long and thirty feet wide. They used the old standard measurement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The entrance hall in front of the main room was thirty feet wide the same as the width of the temple and thirty feet high. He covered its inside walls with pure gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He paneled the larger building with cypress. Then he overlaid it with fine gold. It was decorated with designs in the form of palm trees and chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He covered the building with gems to beautify it and used gold from Parvaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He also overlaid the building, the rafters, the threshold, the walls, and the doors with gold. He carved cherubim angels on the walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He made the most holy place. It was as long as the Temple was wide, thirty feet long. It was also thirty feet wide. He overlaid it with forty-five thousand pounds of fine gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The gold nails weighed twenty ounces. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the most holy place he made two sculptured cherubim angels and covered them with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The combined length of the cherubim wings was thirty feet. A wing of one of the cherub was seven and one half feet long and touched the wall of the building. Its other wing was seven and one half feet long and touched one wing of the other cherub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wing of the other one of the cherub angels was seven and one half feet long and touched the other wall of the building. Its other wing was seven and one half feet long and touched the wing of the first cherub. So the cherubs combined wingspan was thirty feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They stood on their feet facing the main hall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Solomon made the canopy of violet, purple, and dark red cloth and of linen and decorated it with cherubim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He made two pillars for the front of the Temple. They were fifty-three feet long, and the crown on each pillar was seven and one half feet high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He made chains for the inner room and also put them on the crowns. He made one hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He set up the pillars in front of the Temple, one on the right and the other on the left. He named the one on the right Jachin He Establishes and the one on the left Boaz In Him Is Strength.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
