He brought the holy things that had belonged to his father David, the silver, gold, and all the utensils. He put them in the storerooms of Gods Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Solomon assembled the respected leaders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the Israelite families. They came to Jerusalem to take the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah from the City of David, which is Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The men of Israel gathered around the king at the Festival of Booths in the seventh month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When all the leaders of Israel had arrived, the Levites picked up the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They brought the Ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy utensils in it to the Temple. The priests and the Levites carried them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>while King Solomon and the whole assembly from Israel were offering countless sheep and cattle sacrifices in front of the Ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The priests brought Jehovahs Ark of the Covenant to its place in the inner room of the Temple, the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The cherubim angels outstretched wings were over the place where the Ark rested so that the cherubim became a covering above the Ark and its poles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The poles were so long that their ends could be seen in the holy place by anyone standing in front of the inner room. However they could not be seen outside. They are still there today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets Moses placed there at Horeb, where Jehovah made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All the priests who were present had performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy to God without regard to staying in their divisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the Levites who were musicians: Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons, and their relatives were dressed in fine linen and stood east of the altar with cymbals, harps, and lyres. With the musicians were one hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets. When the priests left the holy place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the trumpeters and singers praised and thanked Jehovah in unison. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other musical instruments, they sang in praise to Jehovah: »He is good; his mercy lovingkindness endures forever.« Then Jehovahs Temple was filled with a cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The priests could not serve because of the cloud. Jehovahs glory filled the Temple of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
