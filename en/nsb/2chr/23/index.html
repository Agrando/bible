He made a pact with five army officers: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They went around Judah, gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the leaders of the families of Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The entire assembly made an agreement with the king in Gods Temple. Then Jehoiada said to them: Here is the kings son. He should be king, as Jehovah said about Davids descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You must do this: One third of you, the priests and Levites who are on duty on the day of worship, must guard the gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Another third must be at the royal palace. And another third must be at Foundation Gate. All the people must be in the courtyards of Jehovahs Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Only the priests and Levites who are on duty should come into Jehovahs Temple. They may enter because they are holy. The other people should follow Jehovahs regulations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Levites should surround the king. Each man should have his weapon in his hand. Kill anyone who tries to come into the Temple. Stay with the king wherever he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Levites and all the Judeans did what the priest Jehoiada had ordered them. Each took his men who were coming on duty on the day of worship as well as those who were about to go off duty. Jehoiada did not dismiss the priestly divisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehoiada gave the commanders the spears and the small and large shields. They once belonged to King David but were now in Gods Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The troops stood with their weapons drawn. They were stationed around the king, the altar and the Temple. They were located from the south side to the north side of the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they brought out the kings son and put the crown on him. They gave him the testimony and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. They said: »Long live the king!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king. She entered into the house of Jehovah to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>She saw the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance. The captains and the trumpeters were beside the king. All the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. The singers with their musical instruments lead the praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and said: »This is treason! Treason!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehoiada did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area. He called out the army officers and said: »Take her out between the rows of guards. Kill anyone who tries to rescue her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They seized her and took her to the palace. There at the Horse Gate they killed her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The priest Jehoiada had King Joash and the people join him. They made a covenant that they would be Jehovahs people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they all went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols. Then they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehoiada put the priests and Levites in charge of the work of the Temple. They were to carry out the duties assigned to them by King David. This included burning the sacrifices offered to Jehovah in accordance with the Law of Moses. They were also in charge of the music and the celebrations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehoiada appointed gatekeepers for the gates of Jehovahs temple. That way no one who was unclean for any reason could enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He took the company commanders, the nobles, the peoples governors, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king from Jehovahs Temple. They went through Upper Gate to the royal palace and seated the king on the royal throne. The nobles, the governors of the people, and</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>all the people of the land celebrated. The city was quiet because they had killed Athaliah with a sword.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
