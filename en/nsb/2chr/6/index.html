It is a home for you to live in permanently.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the king turned around and blessed the entire assembly from Israel while they were standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Thanks be to Jehovah God of Israel. With his mouth he made a promise to my father David. With his hand he carried it out.« He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose any city from the tribes of Israel as a place to build a Temple for my name. And I did not choose any man to be prince over my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Now I have chosen Jerusalem to be a place for my name. I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»My father David had his heart set on building a Temple for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»However, Jehovah said to my father David: Since you had your heart set on building a Temple for my name, your intentions were good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»You must not build the Temple. Instead, your own son will build the Temple for my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Jehovah has kept the promise he made. I have taken my father Davids place. I sit on the throne of Israel as Jehovah promised. I have built the Temple for the name of Jehovah God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I put the Ark that contains Jehovahs promise to Israel there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, Solomon stood in front of Jehovahs altar. He stretched out his hands to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Solomon had made a copper platform seven and one half feet long, seven and one half feet wide, and four and one half feet high. He put it in the middle of the courtyard. He stood on the platform, knelt in front of the entire assembly, and stretched out his hands toward heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said: »Jehovah God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven or on earth. You keep your promise of mercy to your servants, who obey you wholeheartedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»You have kept your promise to my father David, your servant. With your mouth you promised it. With your hand you carried it out as it is today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Now then, O Jehovah, God of Israel, keep your promise to my father David, your servant. You said: You will never fail to have an heir sitting in front of me on the throne of Israel if your descendants are faithful to me as you have been faithful to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Therefore, Jehovah, God of Israel, may the promise you made to David, your servant, come true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Does God really live on earth with people? If heaven and the highest heaven cannot hold you, then how can this Temple that I have built?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Nevertheless, O Jehovah my God, please pay attention to my prayer for mercy. Listen to my cry for help as I pray to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Day and night may your eyes be on this Temple, the place where you said your name will be. Listen to me as I pray toward this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Hear the plea for mercy that your people Israel and I pray toward this place. Hear us in heaven, the place where you live. Hear and forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»If anyone sins against another person and is required to take an oath and comes to take the oath in front of your altar in this temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then hear that person in heaven, take action, and make a decision. Repay the guilty person with the proper punishment, but declare the innocent person innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»An enemy may defeat your people Israel because they have sinned against you. But when your people return, praise your name, pray, and plead with you in this Temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then hear them in heaven, forgive the sins of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land that you gave to them and their ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»When the sky is shut and there is no rain because they are sinning against you and they pray toward this place, praise your name, and turn away from their sin because you made them suffer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then hear them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the proper way to live. Then send rain on the land, which you gave to your people as an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»There may be famine in the land. Plant diseases, heat waves, funguses, locusts, or grasshoppers may destroy crops. Enemies may blockade Israels city gates. During every plague or sickness</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>hear every prayer for mercy made by one person or by all the people in Israel, all who know suffering or pain, who stretch out their hands toward this Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Hear them in heaven, where you live. Forgive them and give people the proper reply. You know what is in their hearts, because you alone can read hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>as long as they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors, they will reverence you and follow you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»People who are not Israelites will come from distant countries because of your great name, mighty hand, and powerful arm. When they come to pray facing this Temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>then hear them in heaven, the place where you live. Do everything they ask so that all the people of the world may know your name and respect you like your people Israel and learn that this Temple that I built bears your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»When your people go to war against their enemies, you send them and they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the Temple I built for your name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>then hear their prayer for mercy in heaven, and do what is right for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»They may sin against you. There is no man who is without sin. You may become angry with them and hand them over to an enemy who takes them to another country as captives, whether it is far or near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»If they come to their senses, are sorry for what theyve done, and plead with you in the land where they are captives, saying: We have sinned. We have done wrong. We have been wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»If they change their attitude toward you in the land where they are captives. If they pray to you toward the land that you gave their ancestors, and the city you have chosen, and the Temple I have built for your name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then in heaven, the place where you live, hear their prayer for mercy. Do what is right for them. Forgive your people, who have sinned against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»Finally, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Now arise, and come to your resting place, Jehovah our God, you and the ark of your power. Clothe your priests, Jehovah God, with salvation. Let your godly ones rejoice in what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»O Jehovah our God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember your mercy to your servant David!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
