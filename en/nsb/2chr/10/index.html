When he heard about Rehoboam, he returned from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Israel sent for Jeroboam and invited him back. Jeroboam and all Israel went to speak to Rehoboam. They said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Your father made us carry a heavy burden. Reduce the hard work and lighten the heavy burden he put on us. We will serve you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He said to them: »Come back the day after tomorrow.« So the people left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>King Rehoboam sought advice from the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive. He asked: »What do you advise? How should I respond to these people?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They told him: »If you are good to these people and try to please them by speaking gently to them, then they will always be your servants.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He ignored the advice the elders gave him. He sought advice from the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He asked: »What is your advice? How should we respond to these people who are asking me to lighten the burden my father put on them?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The young men who had grown up with him answered: »This is what you should tell them: My little finger is heavier than my fathers whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»If my father put a heavy burden on you, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will punish you with scorpions.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jeroboam and all the people came back to Rehoboam two days later, as the king had instructed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The king answered them harshly. He ignored the elders advice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He spoke to them as the young men advised. He said: »If my father made your burden heavy, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will use scorpions.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The king refused to listen to the people because Jehovah was directing these events to carry out the promise he had made to Jeroboam, Nebats son through Ahijah from Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king: »What share do we have in Davids kingdom? We will not receive an inheritance from Jesses son. Everyone to his own tent, Israel! Now look after your own house, David!« So all Israel went home to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Rehoboam ruled the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>King Rehoboam sent Hadoram to the Israelites. He was in charge of forced labor, but they stoned him to death. So King Rehoboam got on his chariot as fast as he could and fled to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Israel has rebelled against Davids dynasty to this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
