He ruled for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Joash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, as long as the priest Jehoiada lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehoiada procured two wives for Joash and he had sons and daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Joash wanted to renovate Jehovahs Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them: »Go to the cities of Judah, and collect money throughout Israel to repair the Temple of your God every year. Do it immediately!« But the Levites did not do it immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The king called for the chief priest Jehoiada and asked him: »Why have you not required the Levites to bring the contributions from Judah and Jerusalem? Jehovahs servant Moses and the assembly required Israel to give contributions for the use of the Tent of Testimony of Gods promise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into Gods Temple and used all the holy things of Jehovahs Temple to worship other gods, the Baals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The king issued an order. They made a box and placed it outside the gate of Jehovahs Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They issued a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem that the contributions should be brought to Jehovah. Moses required Israel to make contributions while they were in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the officials and all the people were filled with joy. They brought money and dropped it into the box until it was full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the Levites brought the box to the kings officers and they saw a lot of money. The kings scribe and the chief priests officer would empty the box and put it back in its place. They would do this every day. They collected a lot of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the foremen who were working on Jehovahs Temple. They hired masons and carpenters to renovate Jehovahs Temple. They also hired men who worked with iron and bronze to repair Jehovahs Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The men worked and the project progressed under the foremens guidance. They restored Gods Temple to its proper condition and reinforced it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the repairs were finished, the remaining gold and silver was given to the king and Jehoiada. They used it to have bowls and other utensils made for the Temple. As long as Jehoiada was alive, sacrifices were offered regularly at the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He died at the very old age of one hundred thirty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He was buried in the royal tombs in Jerusalem. This was because he had done so much good for the people of Israel, for God, and for the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>After the death of Jehoiada the priest, the leaders of Judah went to Joash and talked him into doing what they wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The people of Judah stopped worshiping in the Temple of Jehovah God. They started worshiping idols and the symbols of the goddess Asherah. These sinful things made Jehovah God angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However he still sent prophets who warned them to turn back to him. The people refused to listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Gods Spirit spoke to Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. Zechariah told everyone that God was saying: »Why are you disobeying me and my Laws? This will only bring punishment! You have deserted me, so now I will desert you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They plotted against Zechariah. Then they followed the kings order and stoned him to death in the courtyard of Jehovahs Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>King Joash forgot that Zechariahs father had always been a loyal friend. So when the people of Judah plotted to kill Zechariah, Joash joined them and gave orders for them to stone him to death in the courtyard of the Temple. As Zechariah was dying, he said: »I pray that Jehovah will see this and punish all of you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Aramean army attacked Joash at years end. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the peoples leaders. The Arameans sent all the loot they took from Judah and Jerusalem to the king of Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Aramean army came with a small number of men. Jehovah handed Joashs large army over to them because Joashs soldiers had abandoned Jehovah the God of their ancestors. So the Arameans carried out Jehovahs judgment on Joash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Arameans withdrew. They left him suffering from many wounds. His own officials plotted against him for murdering the son of the priest Jehoiada. They killed Joash in his bed and buried him in the City of David. But they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>These were the men who conspired against him: Zabad, son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of a Moabite woman named Shimrith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The record about his sons, the many divine revelations against him, and the rebuilding of Gods Temple is in the notes made in the Book of the Kings. His son Amaziah succeeded him as king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
