I stimulate your memory in each letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You should remember the words that were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Know this first, that in the last days, mockers will come with mockery, walking after their own lusts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Saying, »Where is the promise of his coming? For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep in death, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>According to the same word, the heavens that now are, and the earth, are reserved for fire, being kept for the Day of Judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. (Psalm 90:1, 4)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehovah is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness. He is longsuffering patient toward you. He does not wish that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The day of Jehovah will come as a thief. The heavens will pass away with a great noise. The elements shall be dissolved with intense heat. And the earth and the works in it will be burned up destroyed. (Joel 2:31) (Zephaniah 1:14)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved destroyed, what manner of persons should you be in all holy living and godliness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Look for and earnestly desire the coming presence of the »Day of Jehovah.« (Zephaniah 1:14) The heavens being on fire will be dissolved destroyed, and the elements will melt with intense heat!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness dwells. This is according to his promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seeing that you anticipate these things, be diligent that you may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Consider the patience of our Lord as salvation. Just as our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He spoke about these things in his letters. Some things are hard to understand. The untaught and unstable distort them as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, avoid being carried away with the error of the wicked and falling from your own steadfastness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Grow in the unmerited favor and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
