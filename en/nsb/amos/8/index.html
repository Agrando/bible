I will spare them no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»The songs of the Temple will be weeping in that day,« said the Lord Jehovah: »the dead bodies shall be many. They will observe silence in every place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Hear this, you who would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»You say: When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»We may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Jehovah has sworn by the pride of Jacob: I will never forget any of their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Will the land not tremble for this, and every one who dwells there mourn?

It will be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»It will happen in that day,« said the Lord Jehovah, »that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation dirges. I will bring sackcloth on all loins and baldness on every head. I will make it as the mourning for an only son like the end of a bitter day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Behold, the day is coming,« said the Lord Jehovah, »that I will send a famine in the land. Not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»They will wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east. They will run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and will not find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»In that day the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»They who swear by the sin of Samaria. They will say: As your god lives, O Dan, the way Beersheba lives. They will fall and never rise up again.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
