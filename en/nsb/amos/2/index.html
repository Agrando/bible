He burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»I will send a fire to Moab, and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth. Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I will destroy her ruler and government officials along with him,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehovah continued: »I will not withdraw punishment for the many transgressions of Judah. For they have rejected the Law of Jehovah! They have not kept his statutes. Their lies have led them astray, those after which their fathers walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will send fire upon Judah and it will devour the fortified buildings of Jerusalem.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah said: »I will not withdraw punishment for three sins of Israel, even for four the many transgressions of Israel! They sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»They pant after the dust of the earth on the head of lowly meek persons. They reject the humble! A man and his father have sexual relations with the same maiden, to profane my holy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»They lie down beside every altar on clothes taken from indebtedness. In the house of their God they drink the wine they have confiscated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Before them I destroyed the Amorite. His height was like the height of the cedars. He was strong like the oaks. Yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I brought you out of the land of Egypt. I led you forty years in the desert wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I ordained some of your sons for prophets and some of your young men for Nazirites dedicated ones. Is this true, O you children of Israel?« : said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying: Do Not Prophesy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Consider this, I will weigh you down just as a wagon is weighed down when it is full of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Flight will perish from the swift! The strong will not increase his strength. The mighty will not save himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The archer will not stand. The swift of foot will not save himself. The horseman will not deliver himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»The courageous among the mighty will run away naked in that day,« said Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
