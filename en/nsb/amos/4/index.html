You oppress the poor. You crush the needy. You say to your masters husbandslords, »Bring us drink.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»The Lord Jehovah has sworn by his holiness that the day will come when they will take you away with meat hooks, and those who remain with fish-hooks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»You will go out through the holes in the city wall straight before her. You will be thrown into Harmon a place of exile,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Come to Bethel and transgress! Come to Gilgal and multiply transgression! Bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes every three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened. Proclaim freewill-offerings and make them known. This pleases you, O you children of Israel,« said the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I also gave you cleanness of teeth kept food from your teeth in all your cities and lack of bread in all your places. Yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I withheld rain from you three months before the harvest. I caused it to rain on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city. One received rain. The other did not receive rain and it dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water. They were not satisfied and yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I struck you with scorching and mildew. The caterpillar has devoured the multitudes of your gardens, your vineyards, your fig trees and your olive-trees. Yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I sent a plague among you just as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword and I captured your horses. I made the stench of your camp come up even into your nostrils and yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I overthrew your cities as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire. Yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»This is what I will do to you, O Israel. Because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Behold he who formed the mountains and created the wind and declared to man his thoughts, also made the morning darkness and treads upon the high places of the Earth: Jehovah, the God of Hosts, is his name.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
