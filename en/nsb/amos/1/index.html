He was among the herdsmen of Tekoa in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel. It was two years before the earthquake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He said: »Jehovah roars from Zion! He utters his voice from Jerusalem! The pastures of the shepherds mourn for lack of water. The top of Carmel withers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I will not hold back punishment,« said Jehovah, »For the many transgressions of Damascus. This is because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I will send fire to the house of Hazael and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will destroy the lock bar at the gate of Damascus, and annihilate the inhabitant from the valley of Aven. He who holds the scepter imperial authority from the house of Eden and the people of Syria will go into captivity to Kir,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah said: »I will not withdraw punishment from Gaza for they transgressed many times.
