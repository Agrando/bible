It was the later growth second crop after the kings mowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>It happened when they quit eating the grass of the land. I said, »O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I entreat you: how shall Jacob stand? Since he is so small.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah changed his mind about this. »It will not be,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord Jehovah showed me and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called for judgement contention by fire and it devoured the great deep. It would have eaten up the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I said, »O Lord Jehovah, cease, I plead with you: how can Jacob stand? After all he is small.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah changed his mind concerning this: »This also will not be,« said the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He showed me: and, behold, Jehovah stood beside a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah asked me, »Amos, what do you see?« I said: »A plumb line.« Then Jehovah said: »Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel. I will not spare them any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The high places of Isaac will be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste. I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: »Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Amos said: »Jeroboam will die by the sword. Israel will surely be led away captive in exile out of his land.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Amaziah said to Amos: »Go, run away, you seer. Go into the land of Judah. Eat bread and prophesy there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Do not prophesy any more at Bethel for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Amos told Amaziah, »I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son. I was a herdsman, and a grower of sycamore figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me: Go prophesy to my people Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now hear the word of Jehovah: »You say, do not prophesy against Israel, and do not speak against the house of Isaac.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah proclaims: »Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be divided by measuring line. You will die in a land that is unclean. Israel will surely be led away captive out of his land.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
