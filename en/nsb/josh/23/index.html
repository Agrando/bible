By that time Joshua was very old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He called all Israel, the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of the people, and said: »I am very old now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»You have seen everything Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you. Jehovah your God fights for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I have assigned as the possession of your tribes the land of the nations that are still left, as well as of all the nations that I have already conquered, from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Jehovah your God will make them retreat from you.
