So he sent a message to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and to the kings north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They came out with all their troops and many horses and chariots. Their army was more numerous than the sand of the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All the kings met at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah said to Joshua: »Do not be afraid because of them! About this time tomorrow I will deliver them up all slain before Israel. You must hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua and all the people of war with him came up against them. Suddenly they attacked them by the waters of Merom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, who killed them. They chased them unto great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they killed them. They did not leave any survivor remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joshua did to them what Jehovah told him to do. He hamstrung their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Joshua then turned back, and captured Hazor. He killed the king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They killed all the people there with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them. None were left alive. He burned Hazor with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Joshua took all the cities and all the kings and struck them with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them. Just as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Israel did not burn the cities that stood on their own mounds with the exception of Hazor, which Joshua burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Israel took all the spoil of these cities including the cattle. They killed every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them all. None were left alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah commanded Moses his servant and so Moses commands Joshua and Joshua complied. He left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He captured and killed all their kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Not one city made peace with the children of Israel except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all the others in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It was Jehovah who hardened their hearts to make war against Israel. That way he could completely destroy them. That they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Joshua cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel. Joshua destroyed them utterly along with their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel. Some of them remained in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah said to Moses. Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions, by their tribes. The land rested from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
