They set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. The land was subdued before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There remained among the children of Israel seven tribes that had not yet received their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Joshua said to the children of Israel: »How long will you neglect to go to possess the land, which Jehovah the God of your fathers has given you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Appoint three men from each tribe: and I will send them, and they will rise, and go through the land, and write a description of it according to their inheritance. Then they will return to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They will divide it into seven parts: Judah will abide in their border on the south, and the house of Joseph will abide in their border on the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You will write a description of the land divided into seven parts, and bring the description to me, that I may cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The Levites have no part among you. The priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance. Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the Jehovah gave them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The men stood up and went away. Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying: »Go and walk through the land, and write a description of it, and come again to me, that I may cast lots for you before Jehovah in Shiloh.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The men went and passed through the land, and wrote a description of it by cities into seven parts in a book, and returned to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah. Then Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The lot for the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the boundary of their lot came between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and it ended at the wilderness of Bethaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The border went from there to Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that lies on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>From the hill that lies before Beth-horon southward; and it ended at Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The border came down to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jordan was the border of it on the east side.
