He was the firstborn of Joseph. Machir was the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families. For the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying: »Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.« Therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ten shares fell to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, on the other side of Jordan</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manassehs sons had the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah. It lies before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The coast descended to the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and it ended at the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Southward it was Ephraims, and northward it was Manassehs, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the children of Israel were very strong they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor. They did not completely drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying: »Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as Jehovah has blessed us abundantly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Joshua answered: »If you are a great people, then get to the wood country, and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The children of Joseph said: »The hill is not enough for us. All the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Beth-shean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying: »You are a great people. You have great power. You will not have only one lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The mountain will be yours. For it is a wood, and you will cut it down. The farthest limits will be yours. You will drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they are strong.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
