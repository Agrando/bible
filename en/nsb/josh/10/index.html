The inhabitants of Gibeon made peace with Israel and were living near them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They were very afraid because Gibeon was a great royal city. It was larger than Ai and all the men there were great fighters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Come to me and help me, that we may strike Gibeon: for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon gathered together. They and all their hosts came before Gibeon and camped. Then they made war against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal saying: Do not abandon your servants. Come to us quickly and save us. Help us for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua and all the people of war, the mighty warriors, ascended from Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah said to Joshua: »Do not fear them. I have delivered them into your hands. Not one man of them will stand before you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joshua came against them suddenly by surprise at night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah threw them into confusion before Israel. They were killed in a great battle at Gibeon. They were chased along the road that goes up to Beth-horon. They were slaughtered all the way to Azekah, and Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As they fled from Israel, and were going down to Beth-horon, Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them all the way to Azekah and they died. In fact hailstones killed more than the children of Israel killed using their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Joshua spoke to Jehovah the day when Jehovah delivered the Amorites to the children of Israel. He said in sight of Israel: »Sun, stand still upon Gibeon; and Moon, stand still in the valley of Ajalon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sun stood still, and the moon stood still, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is this not written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not go down for a whole day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There was no day like that before or after it, that Jehovah listened to the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All Israel returned with Joshua to the camp at Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These five kings ran away and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Joshua was told: »The five kings are found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joshua said: »Roll large stones in front of the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Do not stay there but pursue after your enemies and strike the rear guard. Do not enter their cities for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Joshua and the children of Israel finished slaying them those who escaped entered the fortified cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All the people returned in peace to Joshuas at Makkedah. No one spoke against any of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Joshua said: »Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They did so, and brought the five kings to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they brought out the kings to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him: »Come near, put your feet on the back of the necks of humiliateabase these kings.« They came near, and put their feet upon their necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Joshua said: »Do not be afraid. Do not be terrified! Be strong and have courage: for this is what Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Afterward Joshua struck and killed them. He hanged them on five trees: and they hung on the trees until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>At sunset Joshua commanded that they remove them. They took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave where they had been hidden. They laid large stones in the mouth of the cave. Even today the stones are there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>That day Joshua struck Makkedah with the edge of the sword. The king was destroyed all the people who lived there. He let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah the same as he did to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel went with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jehovah delivered it and the king into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the persons who lived there. He let none remain: and he did to the king of Libnah as he did to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel on the second day. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the persons who lived there according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. Joshua killed him and his people, until he had left none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>From Lachish Joshua went to Eglon, and all Israel with him. They encamped against it, and fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword. All that were there were destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Joshua and all Israel with him went from Eglon to Hebron; and they fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They capture it and destroyed it with the edge of the sword. This included the king and all the cities, and all the people who were there. He left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and destroyed all the people there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joshua and all Israel returned with him to Debir and fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He took it, and the king and all the cities there. They killed them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all people there. He left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Joshua struck all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah God of Israel commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Joshua conquered them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joshua returned, and all Israel returned with him to the camp at Gilgal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
