They were discouraged because of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jehovah said to Joshua: »Make sharp knives, and circumcise the men of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Joshua made sharp knives, and circumcised the men of Israel at the Hill of Circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>This is why Joshua circumcised: All the men who came out of Egypt including all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now all the people that came out were circumcised. But all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt were not circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of Jehovah. Jehovah swore that he would not show them the land, which he swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Joshua circumcised their children, whom he raised up in their place. They had not circumcised them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they were done circumcising all the people they stayed in the camp till they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehovah said to Joshua: »This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.« So the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After the Passover they ate the old corn of the land, unleavened cakes, and parched corn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The manna ceased the morning after they ate the old corn of the land. The children of Israel had no more manna. But they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, there stood a man in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said: »Are you on our side or our adversaries?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said: »No, but as captain of the camp of Jehovah I now come.« And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down and said: »What does my lord say to his servant?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The captain commander of Jehovahs host army said to Joshua: »Take your shoes from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy.« And at once Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
