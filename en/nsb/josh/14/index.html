Jehovah commanded the hand of Moses to distribute to the nine tribes and the half tribe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half tribe on the other side of the Jordan. He gave no inheritance to the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. No part of the land was given to the Levites. They were given cities in which to live and a place for their cattle and personally property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The people of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses. They divided the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him: »You know what Jehovah said to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land. I brought him word again as it was in my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people dissolve. But I wholly followed Jehovah my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Moses swore on that day, saying: Surely the land where your feet have trodden shall be your inheritance, and your childrens from generation to generation, because you have completely followed Jehovah my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Jehovah has kept me alive, as he said, these forty-five years, even since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness. Now I am this day eighty-five years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»So far I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength is now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Now therefore give me this mountain. This is where Jehovah spoke that day. You heard about the Anakims that day. Their cities were large and fortified and Jehovah helped me drive them out just as Jehovah said.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Joshua blessed Caleb the son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day, because that he wholly followed Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hebron was previously named Kirjath-arba. Arba was a great man among the Anakims. The land and its people had rest from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
