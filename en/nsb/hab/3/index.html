O Jehovah, make it live in the midst of the years. In the midst of the years make it known! When you are angry remember mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God came from Teman. He is the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens! The earth is full of his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>His brightness is like the sun. He has rays of power coming from his hand! There was protection in his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Before him go the pestilence, and fiery bolts go forth at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He stood and measured the earth. He looked and agitated the nations. The everlasting mountains were shattered! The ancient hills collapsed. His ways are eternal!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction. The tent cloths of the land of Midian trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was your anger against the rivers? Or is your fury against the sea? You rode upon the horses and your chariots are salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Your bow was made quite bare. The oaths to the tribes were a sure word. You split the earth with your rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The mountains saw you and were afraid. The tempest of waters passed by. The deep water uttered its voice, and lifted up its hands power on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation. They went away at the light of your arrows and the shining of your glittering spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You marched through the land in indignation. You trampled the nations in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You went forth for the salvation of your people even for the salvation of your anointed. You wounded the head of the wicked man in the house of the evil. You laid bare the foundation even to the neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You pierced the head of his warriors. They came as a whirlwind to scatter me. They secretly devour the oppressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You tread the sea with your horses, the serge of mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I heard and my body trembled! My lips quivered at the voice. Rottenness entered into my bones and I tremble. I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, for the people who invade us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The fig tree will not flourish. There will be no fruit on the vines. The labor of the olive will fail and the fields will yield no food! The flock will be cut off from the fold and there will be no herd in the stalls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah! I will find joy in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah, the Sovereign Lord, is my strength! He makes my feet like a deerÂ’s feet. He will make me walk upon high places.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
