He winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Wash and perfume yourself and put on your best clothes. Go down to the floor. Make yourself known to the man after he is done eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»When he lies down, notice the place where he lies down. Go in, uncover his feet and lay down. He will tell you what you should do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ruth said: »All that you say to me I will do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law told her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of barley. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Something startled him about midnight. He saw the woman at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said: »Who are you?« She answered: »I am your servant Ruth. Spread your garment over me, for you are my kinsman.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said: »You are blessed of Jehovah, my daughter: for this kindness is greater than what you showed earlier. You have not pursued younger men, whether poor or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»And now, my daughter, have no fear. I will do for you whatever you say, for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»It is true that I am a close relative, but there is a relation nearer than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Rest here tonight. In the morning, if he wants to redeem you, for it is right for a relation to do this, very well, let him do so. But if he will not, then as surely as Jehovah lives, I will do so.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She slept there at his feet until morning. She got up before it was light enough for anyone to see. He said: »Do not let anyone know that a woman came to the grain floor.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said: »Take your robe and stretch it out in your hands.« She did so, and he took six measures of grain and put them into it. Then she went back to town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When she got back, her mother-in-law asked her: »How did it go with you, my daughter?« And she gave her an account of all that the man did to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She said: »He gave me these six measures of grain, saying, Do not go back to your mother-in-law with nothing in your hands.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Naomi said: »Wait until you find out what happened. The man will not rest till he sees this thing through.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
