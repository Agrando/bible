He was a wealthy man from the family of Elimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi: »Now let me go into the fields and pick up the heads of grain after anyone in whose eyes I find favor.« She said to her: »Go, my daughter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So she went and picked up the heads of grain in the field after the cutters. By chance she went into that part of the field owned by Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Boaz came from Bethlehem. He said to the grain-cutters, »Jehovah is with you.« They answered: »Jehovah gives you his blessing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Boaz asked his servant who was in authority over the cutters: »Whose young woman is this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The servant said: »It is a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She said to me: »Let me come into the grain-field and pick up the grain after the cutters.« So she came, and has been here from morning till now, without resting even for a minute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Boaz said to Ruth: »Listen to me, my daughter; do not go to pick up the grain in another field. Do not leave here, but stay with my servant girls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Keep your eyes on the field the men are harvesting and follow with the girls. I told the men not to touch you. When you are thirsty, drink from the water jars the men keep filled.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then she bowed down on her face to the earth, and said to him: »Why have I found favor in your eyes? For you give me attention and I am a foreigner.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Boaz answered: »I have heard about everything you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband. You went away from your father and mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people who are strange to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»May Jehovah reward you for what you have done. May you have a full reward from Jehovah the God of Israel, to whom you have come for protection!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ruth answered: »You are very kind to me, sir. You make me feel better by speaking gently to me, even though I do not even have the standing of one of your servants.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At mealtime Boaz said to her: »Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.« So she sat beside the reapers. He served her roasted grain. She ate and was satisfied and had some left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She rose to glean. Boaz commanded his servants, saying: »Let her glean among the sheaves, and do not bother her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Pull some heads of grain out of what has been corded up and drop them for her to take. Say no sharp word to her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She gathered the heads of grain till evening. After crushing out the seed, it came to about an ephah of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She carried it back to town to show her mother-in-law what she gathered. She kept enough for herself and gave Naomi the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Her mother-in-law said to her: »Where did you gather grain today? Where did you work? Blessed is the man who gave you this attention.« So she gave her mother-in-law an account of where she had been working, and said: »The name of the man with whom I was working today is Boaz.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law: »May Jehovah bless him. The man is kind to the living and to the dead.« Then Naomi admitted to her: »The man is of our family, one of our near relatives.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ruth the Moabitess said: »Truly, he said to me: Keep near my young men till all my grain is cut.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law: »It is better, my daughter, for you to go out with his servant girls, so that no danger may come to you in another field.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So she kept near the servant girls of Boaz to gather the grain till the cutting of the early grain and the cutting of the late grain was ended. She continued living with her mother-in-law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
