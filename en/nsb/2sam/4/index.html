He lost his courage, and all Israel was alarmed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sauls son had two men who were captains of raiding parties. One was named Baanah, and the other was named Rechab. They were the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth from the tribe of Benjamin. Beeroth was considered a part of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim. They still live there today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Sauls son Jonathan had a son who was crippled. When the boy was five years old, the news about the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled to Gittaim. She was in a hurry when she left. He fell from her arms and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Rechab and Baanah went to Ishbosheths house at the noontime. It was a hot day, and he was resting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They came to the middle of the house pretending to get wheat. Once they were inside they stabbed Ishbosheth in the stomach and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They cut off his head and took his head with them. They traveled by way of the Arabah all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They took the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, »Here is the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. Jehovah has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>David responded to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I once seized a man who told me that Saul had died. He thought he was bringing good news. I killed him in Ziklag to reward him for his news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»How much more should I reward wicked men who kill an innocent man on his own bed in his home? Jehovah has rescued me from every trouble. I solemnly swear, as Jehovah lives, I will now seek revenge for his murder and rid the land of you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>David gave the order for his soldiers to kill Rechab and Baanah and cut off their hands and feet. They killed them and hung their hands and feet near the pool in Hebron. They took Ishbosheths head and buried it in Abners tomb there at Hebron.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
