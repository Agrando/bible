Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the cart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ahio walked in front.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>David and all the Israelites danced and sang with all their might to honor Jehovah. They played harps, lyres, drums, tambourines, rattles, and cymbals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As they came to the threshing place of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the Ark of the Covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>At once Jehovah God became angry with Uzzah. He killed him because of his irreverence. Uzzah died there beside the Ark of the Covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because of that the place has been called Perez Uzzah breakthrough of Uzzah ever since. David was furious because Jehovah punished Uzzah in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then David was afraid of Jehovah and said: »How can I take the Ark of the Covenant with me now?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he decided not to take it with him to Jerusalem. Instead, he turned off the road and took it to the house of Obed Edom, a native of the city of Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Ark of Jehovah stayed at the home of Obed Edom from Gath for three months. Jehovah blessed Obed Edom and his whole family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>King David was told: »Jehovah has blessed Obed Edoms home and everything he owns because of the Ark of God.« Then David joyfully went to get the Ark of God from Obed Edoms house and bring it to the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When those who carried the Ark of Jehovah walked six steps, David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wearing a linen ephod, David danced in Jehovahs presence with all his might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He and the entire nation of Israel brought the Ark of Jehovah with shouts of joy and the sounding of rams horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When the Ark of Jehovah came to the City of David, Sauls daughter Michal looked out of a window and saw King David leaping and dancing in Jehovahs presence. She despised him in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The men carrying the Ark set it in its place inside the tent David put up for it. David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in Jehovahs presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>David finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings. Then he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He also distributed to all the people, to the whole crowd of Israelites, men and women, one loaf of bread, one date cake, and one raisin cake. Then all the people went home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>David went home so he could ask Jehovah to bless his family. But Sauls daughter Michal went out and started yelling at him: »You were really great today!« She said. »You acted like a dirty old man. You danced around half-naked in front of your servants slave-girls.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>David answered: »I danced to honor Jehovah. He chose me to be king instead of your father and his family. He made me the leader of his people Israel. I will continue to dance and honor Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»I will disgrace myself even more. You may think I am nothing, but those women think highly of me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Michal, Sauls daughter, never had any children.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
