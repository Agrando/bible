Jehovah promised you that you would lead his people and be their ruler.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All the elders of Israel came to King David at Hebron. He made a sacred alliance with them. They anointed him, and he became king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David was thirty years old when he became king. He ruled for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In Hebron he ruled Judah for seven years and six months. In Jerusalem he ruled for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The king and his men went to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived in that region. The Jebusites told David: »You will never get in here. Even the blind and the lame could turn you away. In other words he could not enter there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However, David captured the fortress Zion, that is, the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That day David said: »Whoever wants to defeat the Jebusites must reach the lame and the blind that hate me by using the water tunnel.« So there is a saying: »The blind and the lame will not get into the palace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built the city of Jerusalem around it from the stronghold citadel to the palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>David continued to grow more powerful because Jehovah God of Hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>King Hiram of Tyre sent some officials to David. Carpenters and stone workers came with them. They brought cedar logs so they could build a palace for David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>David knew that Jehovah made him king of Israel and that he had made him a powerful ruler for the good of his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>David left Hebron and moved to Jerusalem. He married many women from Jerusalem, and he had a lot of children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The following are the names of his sons born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Philistines heard that David was now king of Israel. They mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David found out and went into his fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the Philistines camped in Rephaim Valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>David asked Jehovah: »Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?« Jehovah answered David: »Attack! I will certainly deliver the Philistines to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>David went to Baal Perazim and defeated the Philistines. He said: »Jehovah has overwhelmed my enemies in front of me like an overwhelming flood.« That is why that place is called Baal Perazim Master of Breaking Through</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Philistines left their idols there. David and his men carried them all away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Philistines again attacked and overran the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Once again David consulted Jehovah. Jehovah answered David: »Do not attack them from here. Go around and get ready to attack them from the other side, near the balsam trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Attack when you hear the sound of marching in the treetops. I will be marching ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>David did what Jehovah commanded. He drove the Philistines back from Geba all the way to Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
