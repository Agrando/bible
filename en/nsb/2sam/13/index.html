She was Absaloms sister. She was also the half sister of Amnon. Amnon fell in love with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Tamar was a virgin. Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Amnon had a friend named Jonadab. He was the son of Davids brother Shimeah. Jonadab usually knew how to get what he wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jonadab said to Amnon: »You are the kings son. Even so day after day I see you looking sad. What is the problem?« Amnon answered: »I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my half brother Absalom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jonadab said: »Pretend that you are sick and go to bed. When your father comes to see you, say to him: Please ask my sister Tamar to come and feed me. I want her to fix the food here where I can see her. Then she can serve it to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon went to bed and pretended that he was sick. King David went to see him. Amnon said: »Please have Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her. Then she can serve them to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>David sent word to Tamar at the palace: »Go to Amnons house and fix him some food.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She went there and found him in bed. She prepared dough and made some cakes there where he could see her. Then she baked the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Tamar emptied them out of the pan for him to eat. But he refused to eat. He said: Send everyone away. So they all left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said to her: »Bring the cakes here to my bed and serve them to me.« She took the cakes and went over to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She offered them to him. He grabbed her and said: »Come to bed with me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She said: »No! Do not force me to do this disgraceful thing. It is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»How could I ever hold up my head in public again? And you, you would be completely disgraced in Israel. Please speak to the king. I am sure he will give me to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Amnon wouldnt listen to her. He grabbed his sister and raped her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After that Amnon developed an intense hatred for her. His hatred for her was greater than the lust he felt for her. »Get out of here,« he told her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She said: »No, You do a greater wrong by sending me away than the other thing you did to me!« He would not listen to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He called his servant and said: »Throw this woman out and lock the door!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The servant forced her to leave. He locked the door behind her. The kings unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Tamar tore the robe she was wearing. She put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands. She cried loudly as she walked away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tamars brother Absalom said to her: »How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he is your brother, do not tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.« Tamar soon moved into Absaloms house. She was always sad and lonely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>King David heard what happened and he was furious!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Absalom hated Amnon so much because he raped his sister Tamar. He would not speak to him anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Two years later Absalom had sheep sheared at Baal Hazor, near the town of Ephraim. He invited all the kings sons to be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He went to King David and said: »Your Majesty, I am having my sheep sheared. Will you and your officials take part in the festivities?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The king answered: No, my son. It would be too much trouble for you if we all went. Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in. So he asked Absalom to leave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Absalom said: »Will you at least let my brother Amnon come? Why should he?« The king asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Absalom insisted until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Absalom gave an order to his servants: »Watch now and when Amnon begins to feel good from drinking too much wine, I will tell you, Attack Amnon. Then kill him. Do not be afraid. I give this order. Be strong and courageous.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Absaloms servants did to Amnon as Absalom ordered. Then all the kings sons got up, mounted their mules, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While they were on their way, David heard this rumor: »Absalom has killed all the kings sons, and not a single one is left.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The king stood up and tore his clothes. Then he lay down on the ground. All his servants stood beside him with their clothes torn to show their grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jonadab son of Davids brother Shimea, said: »Do not think that all the young men are dead. They have not killed all the kings sons. Only Amnon is dead. Absalom decided to do this the day his half brother raped his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»You should not burden your heart with the idea that all the kings sons are dead. Your Majesty, only Amnon is dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Absalom has fled. The servant keeping the watch looked outside. He saw many people coming down the road beside the mountain west of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jonadab said: »Your Majesty, look! Here come your sons now, just as I told you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As soon as he finished speaking, the kings sons arrived. They cried loudly and the king and all his men also cried very bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David was sad for a long time because Amnon was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Absalom ran away to Geshur. He stayed there for three years with King Talmai the son of Ammihud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>King David longed for Absalom once people had consoled him over Amnons death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
