David defeated the Amalekites and returned to Ziklag.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Three days later a soldier came from Sauls army. His clothes were torn and dirt was on his head. He knelt down in front of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>David asked: »Where did you come from?« The man answered: »I escaped from Israels army.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»How did the battle go?« David asked. The man said: »Our army turned and ran. Many were wounded and died. King Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>David asked: »How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He answered: »I was on Mount Gilboa. I saw Saul leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry of the enemy closed in on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»He looked my way and called me. I said: Yes here I am.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He asked: Who are you. I told him I was an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Then he said: Come here and kill me! I am badly wounded and about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I went up to him and killed him. I knew that he would die anyway as soon as he fell. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm. Here, I have brought them to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>David and all his men tore their clothes in sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They grieved and mourned and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan and for Israel, the people of Jehovah, because so many had been killed in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>David asked the young man who brought him the news: »Where are you from?« He answered: »I am an Amalekite, son of a foreign resident.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David asked: »Why were you not afraid to take it upon yourself to destroy Jehovahs anointed king?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>David called one of the young men and said: »Execute him!« So he struck him and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David said to him: »Your blood is on your head. Your mouth has testified against you. For you admit that you killed Jehovahs anointed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then David chanted with a lament dirgerequiem over Saul and Jonathan his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He told them to teach the sons of Judah the song of the bow. It is written in the book of Jashar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Your beauty, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Do not tell the news in Gath. Do not announce the victory in the streets of Ashkelon. The daughters of the Philistines will be glad. The daughters of godless men will celebrate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Let no rain or dew fall on the mountains of Gilboa. Let its fields be barren! For the shields of the mighty lie there in disgrace. The shield of Saul is no longer polished with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Jonathans bow was deadly. The sword of Saul was without mercy. He struck down the mighty and killed the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»It was easy to love Saul and Jonathan. Together in life, together in death, they were faster than eagles and stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul. He clothed you in scarlet with luxury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»The brave soldiers have fallen. They were killed in battle. Jonathan lies dead in the hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan. You were dear to me! How wonderful was your love for me. It was better than the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The mighty have fallen, their weapons abandoned and useless.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
