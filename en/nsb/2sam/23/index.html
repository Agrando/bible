The declaration by the man whom God raised up, whom the God of Jacob anointed, the singer of Israels psalms:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»The Spirit of Jehovah spoke through me. His word was on my tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»The God of Israel has spoken. The protector of Israel said to me: The king who rules with justice, who rules in obedience to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»He is like the sun shining on a cloudless day. The sun that makes the grass sparkle after rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»That is how God will bless my descendants. He made an eternal covenant with me. It is an agreement that will not be broken, a promise that will not be changed. That is all I desire. That will be my victory, and God will surely bring it about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»All the evildoers will be like thorns to be pushed away. They may not be gripped in the hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»But with a sharp spear. They are burned on the spot.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These are the names of Davids warriors: Ishbosheth son of Hachmon was the leader of the Three Warriors. In one battle, he killed eight hundred men with his spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The next one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite. One time when the Philistines were at war with Israel, he and David dared the Philistines to fight them. Every one of the Israelite soldiers turned and ran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Eleazar was the exception. He killed Philistines until his hand was cramped. He could not let go of his sword. When Eleazar finished, all the Israelite troops had to do was come back and take the enemies weapons and armor. Jehovah gave Israel a great victory that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Next in rank to him was Shammah, the son of Agee from Harar. The Philistines had gathered at Lehi, where there was a field of ripe lentils. When the troops fled from the Philistines,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>he stood in the middle of the field and defended it by killing Philistines. So Jehovah won an impressive victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At harvest time three of the thirty leading men came to David at the cave of Adullam when a troop from the Philistine army was camping in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David was on a fortified hill. A group of Philistines occupied Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>David grew homesick. He said: »I wish someone would bring me a drink of water from the well by the gate at Bethlehem!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The three famous soldiers forced their way through the Philistine camp. They then drew some water from the well, and brought it back to David. But he would not drink it. He poured it out as an offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David said: »Jehovah, I could never drink this! It would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives!« So he refused to drink it. Those were the brave deeds of the three famous soldiers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joabs brother Abishai led the Thirty Warriors. In one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear. He was as famous as the Three Warriors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In fact he was just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was the commander of the Thirty Warriors. Yet he still did not become one of the Three Warriors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. He killed two of Moabs best fighters. On a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He killed an Egyptian as big as a giant. The Egyptian was armed with a spear. Benaiah only had a club. Benaiah grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Benaiah never became one of the Three Warriors. He was just as famous as they were and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. David made him the leader of his bodyguard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He was honored over the rest of the Thirty Warriors. But he was not equal to the first three. David made him in charge over the fighting men who kept him safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>One of the thirty was Joabs brother Asahel. The thirty leading men were Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Shammah from Harod, Elika from Harod,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai son of Hushai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Zalmon descendant of Ahohi, Maharai from Netophah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Heleb son of Baanah from Netophah, Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Benaiah from Pirathon, Hiddai from the Gaash ravines,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Abi Albon from Beth Arabah, Azmaveth from Bahurim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Elihba from Shaalbon, Bene Jashen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jonathan son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Eliphelet son of Ahasbai and grandson of a man from Maacah, Eliam son of Ahithophel from Gilo,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Hezrai from Carmel, Paarai from Arabah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani from the tribe of Gad,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Zelek from Ammon, Naharai from Beeroth, armorbearer for Zeruiahs son Joab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ira descendant of Ithra, Gareb descendant of Ithra,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and Uriah the Hittite, thirty-seven in all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
