Jehovah kept him safe from all his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The king said to the prophet Nathan: »I live in a house built of cedar. Yet the Ark of God is kept in a tent!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Nathan answered: »Do what you have in mind. Jehovah is with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That night Jehovah said to Nathan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Go tell my servant David that I say to him: You are not the one to build a temple for me to live in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»From the time I rescued the people of Israel from Egypt until now, I have never lived in a temple. I have traveled around living in a tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»In all my traveling with the people of Israel I never asked any of the leaders that I appointed why they had not built me a temple made of cedar.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Say this to my servant David: This is what Jehovah of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture where you followed sheep so that you could be the leader of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I was with you wherever you went. I destroyed all your enemies in front of you. I will make your name famous like the names of the greatest people on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I will make a place for my people Israel and plant them there. They will dwell in their own place and not be troubled anymore. The wicked will not oppress them as they used to do</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>when I let judges rule my people. I have kept your enemies from attacking you. Now I promise that you and your descendants will be kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I will choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried in the tomb of your ancestors. I will make him a strong ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I will allow no one to take his long lasting kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I will be his father. He will be my son. When he does wrong I will correct him just as parents correct children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I will never put an end to my agreement with him. I put an end to my agreement with Saul when he was king before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I will make sure that one of your descendants will be king for a very long time. Your throne will be established from generation to generation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nathan told David exactly what he heard in the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>David went into the tent he set up for the ark. Then he sat there and prayed: »Jehovah All-Powerful, my family and I do not deserve what you have already done for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Yet this was insignificant in your eyes, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah for you have spoken also of your servants house in the distant future. And this is the law for man, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»For the sake of your Word and according to your will you have done this great thing. You have made it known to your servant!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»For this reason you are great, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah. There is none like you. There is no God besides you according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»There is no other nation on earth like Israel. This is the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so your people could live here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»You chose Israel to be your people from generation to generation! You have become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»And now, Jehovah God, please do what you have promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»You will be famous for a very long time! Everyone will say: »Jehovah of Hosts rules Israel. Davids descendants are his chosen kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Now therefore, may it please you to bless the house of your servant that it may continue a long time before you. You O Lord Jehovah have spoken. May the house of your servant be blessed from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Lord Jehovah, you are God. You have promised me some very good things, and you can be trusted to do what you promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Please bless my descendants and let them be your chosen kings for a very long time. You have already promised, and I am sure that you will bless my family from generation to generation.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
