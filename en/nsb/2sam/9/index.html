If they are I will be kind to them. This is because I made a promise to Jonathan.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There was a servant of Sauls family named Ziba. He was told to go to David. »Are you Ziba?« The king asked. »I am at your service.« He answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The king asked him: »Is there anyone left of Sauls family to whom I can show loyalty and kindness? I promised God I would.« Ziba answered: »There is still one of Jonathans sons. He is crippled.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Where is he?« The king asked. Ziba answered: »At the home of Machir son of Ammiel in Lodebar.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>King David sent for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul arrived. He bowed down before David in respect. David said: »Mephibosheth.« He answered: »I am here to serve.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>David replied: »Do not be afraid. I will be kind to you for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will give you back all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul. You will always be welcome at my table.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Mephibosheth bowed again and said: »I am no better than a dead dog! Why should you be so good to me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The king called Ziba, Sauls servant, and said: »I am giving Mephibosheth, your masters grandson, everything that belonged to Saul and his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»You, your sons, and your servants will farm the land for your master Sauls family and bring in the harvest. This will provide food for them. Mephibosheth will always be a guest at my table.« Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ziba answered: »I will do everything Your Majesty commands.« So Mephibosheth ate at the kings table, just like one of the kings sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. Everyone who lived at Zibas home became Mephibosheths servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Mephibosheth was disabled. He lived in Jerusalem. He always ate at the kings table.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
