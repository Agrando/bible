He is my Savior,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»My God, My rock in whom I take refuge. He is my shield, the strength of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge. He is my Savior who saved me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Jehovah should be praised. I called on him and was saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The waves of death had surrounded me. The torrents of destruction had overwhelmed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The danger of death was around me. The grave set its trap for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I called to Jehovah in my trouble. I called to my God for help. In his temple he heard my voice. He listened to my cry for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Earth shook and shivered! The columns supporting the sky rocked back and forth. You were angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»You breathed out smoke. Scorching heat and fiery flames spewed from your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»You opened the heavens like curtains. You came down with storm clouds under your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»You rode on the angels as you flew. You soared on the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»You surrounded yourself with darkness. You made the dark rain clouds your covers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Out of the brightness in front of you, you made lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Jehovah thundered from heaven. The Most High made his voice heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»You shot arrows and scattered them. You flashed bolts of lightning and confused them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Then the ocean floor could be seen. The foundations of the earth were laid bare at Jehovahs stern warning, at the blast of breath from your nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»You reached down from high above and took hold of me. You pulled me out of the raging water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»You rescued me from enemies who were hateful and too powerful for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»When I was in trouble they attacked me. You O Sovereign Jehovah protected me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»You helped me out of danger. You saved me because you were pleased with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»You Jehovah rewarded me because of my righteousness. Because my hands are clean you rewarded me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»I have kept the ways of Jehovah. I have not wickedly turned away from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»All your judgments are in front of me. I have not turned away from your laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»You know I am faultless. I have kept myself from doing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»You reward me because I do what is right. You know I am innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»O Jehovah, you are faithful to those who are faithful to you, and completely good to those who are faultless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You are pure to those who are pure, but hostile to those who are wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»You rescue the humble. You find ways to humiliate the proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Jehovah our God, you are my lamp. You turn darkness into light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»You help me run through armies and leap over city walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Your way is perfect Jehovah. Your word is correct. You are a shield for those who run to you for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Who is God but Jehovah? Who is a rock other than our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»God arms me with strength. Your perfect way sets me free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»You make me sure-footed as a deer. You keep me safe on the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»You train me for battle, so that I can use the strongest bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»O Jehovah you protect me and save me. Your help has made me grow great multiply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»You clear the way for me. I will not stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»I chased my enemies until I caught them and destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»I destroyed them! I stuck my sword through my enemies. They were crushed under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»You armed me and gave me strength to fight. You subdued and brought low those who came against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»By you they turn their backs and run. Those who hate me are silenced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»They cried for help, but there was no help. They called to you Jehovah and you did not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»They were crushed as small as the dust of the earth. I stamped them down under my feet like the waste of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»You rescued me from my stubborn people. You made me the leader of foreign nations. They are now my slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»Foreigners obey and come crawling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Foreigners lose heart and are fearful in their fortresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Jehovah lives! Blessed is my rock! May God, the rock of my salvation, be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»You, Jehovah, give me victory over my enemies! You subdue nations under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»You protect me from violent enemies. You made me greater than all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»I will praise you, Jehovah, and I will honor you among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»You give glorious victories to your anointed king. Your faithful love for David and for his descendants will never end.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
