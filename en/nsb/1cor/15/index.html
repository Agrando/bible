You have received it and should continue strong in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You will be saved through the good news if you hold fast to the word I preached to you. That way you will not believe in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>First of all, I delivered to you what I also received, how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He was buried, and he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He was seen by Peter and then by the twelve apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>More than five hundred brothers saw him at the same time after that. Most of them remain to this day, but some have fallen asleep in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he was seen by James, and then by all the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And last of all I also saw him, as of one with an untimely birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the least of the apostles and do not deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the people of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By the divine influence of God I am what I am. His grace was not given to me in vain for I labored more than all of them. Yet it was not I. It was the divine influence and favor of God in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore whether they preached or I preached, you believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If we preached that Christ was raised from the dead, how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is worth nothing, and your faith is also without value.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We are found to be false witnesses of God because we have testified that God raised Christ from the dead. If he did not raise him up from the dead then the dead are not raised up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the dead are not raised up then Christ has not been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if Christ is not resurrected, your faith is worth nothing, and you are still in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable pitiable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Christ has risen from the dead, and has become the first fruits of those who slept in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Death came because of what one man did. The resurrection of the dead also comes because of what one man did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Everyone will be raised to life in the right order: Christ the first fruits and afterward those who belong to Christ at the time of his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In the end Christ will deliver the kingdom to God the Father. Christ will destroy every ruler and all authority and all power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he Christ must rule as king until he God puts all enemies under his feet his control. (Psalm 2; 110) (Daniel 2:44) (Revelation 5:10; Revelation 20:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy to be destroyed will be death. (Revelation 20:14)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>According to the Scriptures: God has placed all things under his control subjection. (Ephesians 1:22) But when he said all things are placed under him, it is with the exception of God. For God is the one who placed all things under him Christ. (1 Peter 3:22) (John 3:35)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When all things shall be subdued under the Son, then the Son will also be subjected to God who put all things under him, that God may be all in all ruler over everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>What will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Why do we stand in jeopardy in danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I face death daily even as I rejoice over you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage was it to me if the dead do not rise? Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be deceived: Bad company corrupts good morals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wake up to righteousness and do not sin. Some do not have knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will say: How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You fool, that which you sow is not alive unless it first dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>That which you sow, you sow not that body that will develop, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some other grain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives it a body as it pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are also celestial heavenly bodies and terrestrial earthly bodies. The glory of the celestial is one thing and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. For one star differs from another star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption. It is raised in incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness and it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a natural body and it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thus it is written: »The first man Adam was made a living being.« The last Adam became a life giving spirit!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>How is it the first is not spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man is from the earth, earthy: the second man is from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As is the earthy so are those who are of the earth. And as is the heavenly, so are those who are of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Corruption may not inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I show you a secret. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last reverberation of the trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When this corruptible shall be clothed with Greek: enduo: dressed, put on incorruption, and this mortal shall be clothed with immortality, then the saying will come true: »Death is swallowed up in victory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>»O death, where is your sting power to hurt? O grave, where is your victory?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks to God, because he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and unmovable. Always have plenty to do in the work of the Lord, for you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
