And no person can say, »Jesus is the Lord,« except by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There are different gifts, but the same Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there are different operations, but it is the same God who works in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The manifestation expression of the Spirit is given to everyone for a beneficial purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the one Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To another the workings of miracles and to another prophesy. To another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But in all these the same Spirit works, making a distribution to each one as he God wills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many and are one body, so also is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we are Jews or people of the nations, whether we are bond or free; we were all made to drink of one Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the body is not one member, but many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If the foot should say: »Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body;« is it therefore not of the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If the ear should say: »Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body;« is it therefore not of the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If the whole body were an eye, where is the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where is the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Has God set the members of the body, every one of them, just as it pleased him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they were all one member, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now they are many members, yet they are one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, »I have no need of you:« nor again the head to the feet, »I have no need of you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Those members of the body, which seem to be weaker, are necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those members of the body that we think to be less honorable, we offer these more honors. Our less acceptable parts have more abundant acceptability.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For our acceptable parts have no need. But God has assembled the body together, having given more abundant honor to the part that was lacking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There should be no division in the body. So the members should have the same care for each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When one member suffers all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God has appointed some in the congregation: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helpers, abilities to direct, different tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all have the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Zealously seek earnestly desire the best gifts. Yet I show you a more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
