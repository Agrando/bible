Love is kind. Love is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not arrogant proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Love does not act indecently. It is not selfish. It is not provoked and does not take into account a wrong suffered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Love does not rejoice with evil, but rejoices with the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Love never fails. Where there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away. Where there are tongues, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we know in part and we prophesy in part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the perfect comes, the partial imperfectincomplete will be done away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, and reason like a child. When I became an adult I did away with childish things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For now we see in a mirror dimly, and then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Faith, hope and love remain. These three! The greatest of these is love!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
