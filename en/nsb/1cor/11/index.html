She is the same as if she had her head shaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For if the woman were not covered, let her also be shaved. But if it is a shame for a woman to have her head shaved, let her be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a man should not cover his head, for he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the man is not from the woman; but the woman is from the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Neither was man created for woman but woman for man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That is why the woman should have a sign of authority on her head because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>However in the Lord, both men and women exist together. Not one without the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as woman is from man, even so is man also from woman. But all things are from God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge in yourselves. Is it proper that women pray to God uncovered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if men have long hair, it is a shame?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone is contentious about this we have no other practice, neither do the congregations of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now in this that I declare to you that I do not praise you. For you come together not for the better but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For first of all, when you come together in the congregation, I hear that there are divisions among you and I partly believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must be also heresies among you that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you come together to one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For in eating every one goes ahead with out waiting for everybody else. One is hungry and another is drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the congregation of God, and shame them that have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I will not praise you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord that which I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, »Take and eat. This represents is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same manner, after supper, he took the cup, saying, »This cup represents is the new covenant of my blood. Drink this as often as you do it in remembrance of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death till he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of sinning againstfalsely representing the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let a man examine himself before he eats of that bread, and drinks of that cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning not judging rightly the Lord's body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged, Jehovah disciplines us, that we should not be destroyed condemned with the world. (Proverbs 3:11)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If any man is hungry let him eat at home. That way you come together without condemnation. I will give direction to care for other matters when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
