To you, who are sanctified in Christ Jesus. You who are called to be holy ones, with all whom in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. He is both their Lord and ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God that is given you by Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He enriches you in every way, in all speaking, and in all knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The testimony of Christ was confirmed verifiedestablished in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You do not lack spiritual gifts as you wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He will also confirm establish you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there are no divisions among you. You should be perfectly joined together united in the same mind and thought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The house of Chloe told me, my brothers, that there are disputes among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Concerning that I say, that each one of you said, »I follow Paul;« and »I follow Apollos;« and »I follow Cephas;« and »I follow Christ.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is Christ divided? Was Paul impaled for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So no one should say that I baptized in my own name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides that I do not know whether I baptized any others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the good news: not with wisdom of words, lest the stake of Christ be emptied of its effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the preaching of the stake is foolishness to those who perish. It is the power of God to us who are saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is written: »I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.« (Isaiah 29:14)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the wisdom of God that the world through its wisdom did not come to know God. God was well pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>We preach Christ impaled. It is a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, it is Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Consider your calling, brothers. Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Instead God chose the foolish things of the world to confuse shame the wise. God chose the weak things of the world to confuse shame the things that are mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God also chose the base things of the world, and things which are despised, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>No human being should boast before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It is because of him you are united with Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let it be as it is written, »He that boasts, let him boast in Jehovah!« (Jeremiah 9:24)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
