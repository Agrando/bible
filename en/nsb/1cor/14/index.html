No man understands him. He speaks secrets by the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the person who prophesies proclaims Gods Word openly speaks to men to build up, encourage and comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The person who speaks in an unknown tongue enlightens himself; but he who declares Gods Word enlightens the entire congregation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I would like it that you all speak with tongues, but I prefer that you prophesy. The person who announces teachespreaches Gods Word is greater than the person who speaks with tongues. The person who speaks with tongues should have an interpreter so the congregation may receive understanding and knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Inanimate objects that make a sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The same for you unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will speak into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore if I do not know the meaning of what someone is saying I will be a foreigner to him that speaks. And he that speaks will be a foreigner to me too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As much as you are zealous for spiritual gifts, strive to build-up increase the enlightenment understanding of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let the one who speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret what he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding mind is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding Greek: nous: mind also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding mind also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When you bless with the spirit, how will the audience of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not understand what you said?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you give thanks well, but the other is not given understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God that I speak with tongues more then all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet in the congregation I would rather speak five words with my understanding than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, do not be like children in understanding. When it comes to evil be innocent children but in your thinking be mature adults.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is written in the law: »With men of other tongues and lips of foreigners I will speak to this people. Even then they will not listen to me,« said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore speaking in tongues is a sign not for believers, but for those who do not believe. Prophesying proclaiming Gods Word serves the believer and not the unbeliever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore the whole congregation comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and the unlearned, or unbelievers, come there will they not say that you are out of your mind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all proclaim Gods Word and an unbeliever comes there he is convinced by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The secrets of his heart are made known. So falling down on his face he will worship God, and report, »God is truly among you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How is it then, brothers? When you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, and has an interpretation. Let all things be done to clarify and offer understanding!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If anyone speaks in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three. It should be orderly by plan and someone must interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, let the speaker keep silence in the congregation and speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let two or three prophets speak and let the others listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If there is a revelation to another while sitting there, let the others keep quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You may all prophesy one by one in turn that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the prophets control the spirits mindsmental disposition of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the congregations of the holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let women keep silent in the congregations. They are not permitted to speak. They must be in submission as it says in the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When they want to learn something, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is improper for a woman to speak in the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any man does not recognize understand this he will not be recognized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Seek to prophesy brothers, and do not forbid speaking with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
