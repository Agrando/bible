Likewise also the husband has no authority over his own body, but his wife does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent for a time. That way you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. Then come together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I speak this by concession and not by commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I prefer that all men were as I am. But every man has his proper gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they stay unmarried like me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry. It is better to marry than to be inflamed with lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord commands do not let the wife depart from her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If she leaves, let her remain unmarried or become reconciled to her husband. A husband should not divorce his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To the others, I speak and not the Lord. If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him he should not divorce her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is willing to live with her, she should not divorce him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the wife sanctifies the unbelieving husband, and the husband sanctifies the unbelieving wife. Otherwise your children would be unclean. But now they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If the unbelieving leave, let him leave. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases for God has called us to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wife how do you know that you will save your husband? Husband how do you know whether you will save your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as God has distributed to every person so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the congregations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is any man called being circumcised? He should not become uncircumcised. Is any called who is not circumcised? He should not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing. Obey the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Each man should remain in the same condition in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you called being a slave? Do not let it worry you. But if you can become free, do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He who is called in the Lord, being a slave, is the Lord's freeman. Likewise also he who is called, being free, is Christ's slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You are bought with a price. Stop being slaves of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brothers, let every man remain in the condition in which he was called. Abide with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord. Yet I give my opinion as one who has obtained the mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Because of the present distress I think it is good for you to remain as you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek a release. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If you marry you have not sinned. If a virgin marries she has not sinned. Those who marry will face many problems in this life and I want to spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will say this brothers the time remaining is short. So from now on those who have wives should be like those who have none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Those who weep should be like those who do not weep. And those who rejoice should be like those who do not rejoice, and those who buy like those who do not possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Those who use this world should not abuse it, for the fashion of this world is passing away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I want you to be free from anxiety. He who is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he who is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. She who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I say this for your benefit and not to restrict you. I show you how to live a noble life of devotion to the Lord without being distracted by other things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If any man thinks he behaves improperly toward his virgin, if she is past her youth, let him do what he will, he does not sin if they get married.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virginity he does well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then he who gives his virginity in marriage does well; but he who does not get married does even better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier if she remains as she is. This is my opinion and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
