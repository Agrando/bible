Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If any man thinks he knows any thing, he really knows nothing, according to what he ought to know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But if any man loves God, God knows him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Concerning the eating of food offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There are those called gods in heaven or on earth. There are many gods and many lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But to us there is but one God, the Father. All things come from him and we live for him. And there is one Lord Jesus Christ. All things were made through him and we were made through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Not all people know this. Some eat food offered to idols and their conscience being weak is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But food will not recommend us to God. If we do not eat we are not worse. If we eat we are not better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be careful that this freedom does not become a stumbling block to those who are weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If any man with knowledge sees you having a meal from an idolÂ’s temple, will the conscience of the weak one be emboldened encouraged to eat food offered to idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And because of your knowledge the weak brother will perish.
