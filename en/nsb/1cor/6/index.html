Why not let the holy ones decide who is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world? And if you will judge the world, are you unworthy to judge these small matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the matters that pertain to this life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, would you appoint as judges those who mean nothing to the congregation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I speak to shame you. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? Not one who would be able to judge between his brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goes to court against brother, and this before unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not let yourself be wronged? Why not let your selves be defrauded cheated?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Instead you do wrong and defraud, and you do this to your brothers and sisters!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither fornicators, nor people who worship idols, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor covetous greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, will inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That is what some of you were. You have been washed clean and now you are sanctified. The Spirit of our God declares you righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient profitablegood. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the authority powercontrol of anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Foods are for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will destroy both of them. Now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>God has resurrected the Lord, and will also resurrect us by his own power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and unite them with turn them into the members of a prostitute? God forbid!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What? Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one united with her body? For he said: »Two will be one flesh.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who is joined to the Lord is one united with him in spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee from fornication! Every sin that a man does is outside his body. But he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What? Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit? That one Greek: »hos he ho« which, that one is in you. You received it from God. You are not your own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You are bought with a price! Therefore glorify God in your body.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
