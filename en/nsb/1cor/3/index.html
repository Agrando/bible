You were not able to receive it. You are not able now!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You are still fleshly! There is envy, strife, and divisions among you. Do you not walk as ordinary men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>While one said, »I belong to Paul;« and another, »I belong to Apollos;« are you not fleshly human beings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God caused the growth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Neither he that plants and neither he that waters is anything; but God gives the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are one in purpose and every man will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are fellow workers together with God. You are God's field under cultivation. You are God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let every man take heed how he builds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No other foundation can be laid than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if any man builds upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, and stubble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>every man's work will be made known, for the day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will prove what sort every man's work is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man's work that he built upon lasts, he will receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a man's work will be burned, he will suffer loss: but he will be saved by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>God will destroy any man who defiles the temple of God! For the temple of God is holy. You are that temple!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God. It is written: »He catches the wise in their own craftiness deception.« (Job 5:13)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again: »Jehovah knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain uselessempty.« (Psalm 94:11)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no man boast in men. For all things are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
