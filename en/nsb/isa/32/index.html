Princes will rule for the sake of justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind and a place to hide from storms. They will be like streams flowing in a desert, like the shadow of a giant rock in a barren land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Their eyes and ears will be open to the needs of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will not be impatient any longer, but they will act with understanding and will pay attention to the needs of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>No one will think that a fool is honorable or say that a scoundrel is honest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A fool speaks foolishly and thinks up evil things to do. He promotes wickedness and what he says insults Jehovah. He never feeds the hungry or gives thirsty people anything to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As for a rogue, his weapons are evil. He devises wicked schemes to destroy the afflicted with slander, even though the needy one speaks what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the noble man devises noble plans. He stands firm for what is honorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Rise up, you women who are at ease. Hear my voice and pay attention to my word, you complacent daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Within a year and some days you will be troubled, O complacent women for the vintage is ended, the fruit gathering will not happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Tremble you women who are at ease. Be troubled you complacent ones. Undress and put sackcloth on your waist,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the land of my people where thorns and briars will grow for they are on the delightful houses and the exultant city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because the palace has been abandoned, the populated city forsaken. Hill and watchtower have become caves forever. They will be a delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Spirit will be poured out upon us from on high. Then the wilderness will be turned into a fertile field, and the fertile field will be considered a forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then justice will live in the wilderness, and righteousness will be at home in the fertile field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>An act of righteousness will bring about peace and security forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My people will live in a peaceful place, in safe homes and quiet places of rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The forest will be flattened because of hail, and the city will be completely leveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Blessed are those who plant beside every stream and those who let cattle and donkeys roam freely.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
