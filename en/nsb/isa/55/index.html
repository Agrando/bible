You, who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and you will delight in the richest of fare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Give ear and come to me; listen to me, that you may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, my faithful love promised to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You will summon nations you do not know. Nations that do not know you will run to you, because of Jehovah your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has endowed you with splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Seek Jehovah while he may be found. Call on him while he is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts.

Instead of briers the myrtle will grow. This will be for Jehovahs fame. It will be for an everlasting sign, which will not be destroyed.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
