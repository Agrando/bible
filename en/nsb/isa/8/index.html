She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Jehovah told me: »Name him Maher Shalal Hash Baz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Before the boy knows how to say »Father« or »Mother« the wealth of Damascus and the loot from Samaria will be carried away to the king of Assyria.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah spoke to me again, He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»These people have rejected the gently flowing water of Shiloah and find joy in Rezin and Remaliah's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»That is why Jehovah is going to bring against them the raging and powerful floodwaters of the Euphrates River, that is, the king of Assyria with all his power. It will overflow all its channels and go over all its banks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»It will sweep through Judah. It will overflow and pass through. It will be neck-high. Its outspread wings will extend over your entire country, O Immanuel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be broken, you people. Be terrified. Listen all you distant parts of the earth. Prepare for battle and be terrified. Prepare for battle and be terrified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make plans for battle, but they will never succeed. Give orders, but they will not be carried out, because God is with us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is what Jehovah said with his powerful hand on me. He warned me not to follow the ways of these people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Do not say that everything these people call a conspiracy is a conspiracy. Do not fear what they fear. Do not let it terrify you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Remember that Jehovah of Hosts is holy. He is the one you should respect. He is the one you should reverence venerateexalt.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will be a place of safety for you. But he will be a rock that makes people trip and a stumbling block for both kingdoms of Israel. He will be a trap and a snare for those who live in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Many will stumble over them. They will fall and be broken. They will be trapped and caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tie up the written instructions. Seal the precepts law among my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will wait for Jehovah, who hides his face from the descendants of Jacob. I will hope in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am here with the children Jehovah has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from Jehovah of Hosts, who lives on Mount Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>People will say to you: »Ask for help from the mediums and the fortunetellers, who whisper and mutter.« Should people ask their God for help instead? Why should they ask the dead to help the living?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They should go to the teachings and to the written instructions. If people do not speak these words, it is because there is no light truth in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They will pass through the land when they are hard-pressed destressed and hungry. When they are hungry, they will be furious. Then they will look up and curse their king and God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They will look toward the nations of the earth and see only distress and gloom. They will go in anguish and be banished into darkness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
