Make your shadow like night at high noon. Hide the fugitives! Do not betray the refugees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you. Be their shelter from the destroyer. The oppressor will come to an end. Destruction will cease! For the aggressor will vanish from the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»In love a throne will be established and in faithfulness a man will sit on it. One shall sit upon it in truth and faithfulness. He will be from the tent of David. He will judge and seek justice and speed the cause of righteousness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have heard of the pride of Moab and of his arrogance. We know of his pride, conceit and empty boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Moabites cry, they cry out together for Moab. Lament and grieve for the men and the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The fields of Heshbon and the vines of Sibmah wither. The rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines, which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I weep, as Jazer weeps, for the vines of Sibmah. O Heshbon, O Elealeh, I drench you with tears! The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards. No one sings or shouts in the vineyards! No one treads out wine at the presses, for I have put an end to the shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That is why my heart mourns for Moab like a harp. I mourn for Kir Hareseth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the people of Moab appear at the worship site, they will only wear themselves out. They will come into the holy place to pray, but they will not be able to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is the message Jehovah spoke about Moab in the past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now Jehovah says: »Moab's honor will be despised within three years. I will count them like workers count the years left of their contracts. In spite of their great number, the survivors will be very few and powerless.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
