Raise your voice to them. Shake the hand so they may enter the doors of the nobles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I have commanded my consecrated ones. I have called my mighty warriors. My proud ones are to express my anger, those who rejoice in my majesty excellency.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Listen! A sound of tumult on the mountains is like that of many people! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms and nations gathered together! Jehovah of Hosts assembles inspects the army for battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They come from a far country, from the extremities of the heavens horizons. Jehovah and his instruments of indignation come to destroy the whole land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Shout wailhowl for the Day of Jehovah is near! It will come as destruction from the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»All hands will fall impaired weakened. Every man's heart will melt courage will fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»They will be terrified! Pains and anguish will possess them. They will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look at one another in amazement with their faces reddened with excitement aflame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Behold! The Day of Jehovah is coming! It will be cruel, with fury and burning anger. It will make the land desolation and exterminate the sinners from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The stars of heaven and their constellations will not shine forth their light. The sun will be dark when it rises and the moon will not shine its light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity. I will also end the arrogance of the proud. I will demean disgrace the arrogance of tyranny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I will make mortal man harder to find than pure gold and mankind than the gold of Ophir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Therefore I will make the heavens tremble. The earth will shake from its place at the fury of Jehovah of Hosts in the day of his burning anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»They will each turn to his own people, and each one escape to his own land just like a hunted gazelle, or like sheep without a shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»All who are found will be pierced through. All who are captured will fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Their infant children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be plundered and their wives raped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I will stir up the Medes against them. They will not value silver or take pleasure in gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»And their bows will mow down the young men. They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb. Nor will they have compassion on children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Babylon, the beauty honorglory of kingdoms, the majesty of Chaldean pride, will be overthrew by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation! Nor will the Arab pitch his tent there. Nor will shepherds take their flocks there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»But desert animals will lie down there. Their houses will be full of owls! Shaggy goats demons will play there and ostriches will dance there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Wild beasts will howl in her fortified towers and jackals in her luxurious temples. Her time also will soon come and her days will not be prolonged.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
