You swear by the name of Jehovah and claim to worship the God of Israel. However you do not mean a word you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Yet you are proud to say that you are citizens of the holy city and that you depend on Israel's God, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah says to Israel: »Long ago I predicted what would take place. Then suddenly I made it happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I knew that you would prove to be stubborn. You were as rigid as iron and unyielding as copper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I predicted your future long ago. I announced events before they took place, to keep you from claiming that your idols and images made them happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»All I foretold has now taken place. You have to admit my predictions were right. Now I will tell you of new things to come, events that I did not reveal before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, not in the past. You have not heard about them before today, so you cannot say that you already knew about them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You have never heard about them. You have never known about them. Your ears have never been open to hear them before. I know that you have acted very treacherously and that you have been called a rebel since you were born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»For my name's sake I will be patient. For my glory's sake I will hold my anger back from you, and not destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I have been testing you for myself like silver. I have put you through the fire of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I did it for myself and because of my name. I will not let my name be shamed profaned. I will not give my glory to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Listen to me Jacob and Israel, my loved one. I am he, I am the first and I am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»My hand laid the foundation of the earth. My right hand stretched out the heavens. When I call for them, they both stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Gather together, all of you, and listen. What idol has revealed such things? Jehovah loves Cyrus. He will carry out Jehovahs plan against Babylon. He will use his strength against the Babylonians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I alone have spoken. I have called him. I will bring him here and he will succeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Come here. Listen to this! From the beginning I have spoken nothing in private. From the time it took place, I was there. Now the Lord Jehovah has sent me, and his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This is what Jehovah your Defender Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, says: »I am Jehovah your God. I teach you what is best for you. I lead you where you should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»If only you had listened to my commandments! Your peace would be like a river that never runs dry. Your righteousness would be like waves on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Your descendants would be like sand. Your children would be like its grains. Their names would not be cut off or wiped out in my presence.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Get out of Babylon! Flee from the Babylonians! Shout for joy as you tell it and announce it. Shout it out to the ends of the earth. Say: »Jehovah has reclaimed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»They were not thirsty when he led them through the deserts. He made water flow from a rock for them. He split a rock, and water gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»There is no peace for the wicked,« says Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
