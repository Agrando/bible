Army of Elam, attack! Army of Media, lay siege to the cities! God will put an end to the suffering that Babylon has caused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>What I saw and heard in the vision has filled me with terror and pain. My hips are full of pain and convulsions like that of a woman in labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My innermost being reels, horror overwhelms me. The twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They set the table, they spread out the cloth, they eat, they drink; Rise up, captains, oil the shields,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this is what Jehovah says to me: »Go, station the lookout, and let him report what he sees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, a train of donkeys, a train of camels, Let him pay close attention, very close attention.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The watchman called out from the tower: »Sir, I stand on the watchtower every day. Every night, I stand guard at my post.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Look! Here come chariots and horsemen in pairs. Then he said: Babylon has fallen! She has fallen! All the idols they worship lie shattered on the ground.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You, my people, have been threshed and winnowed. I make known to you what I heard from Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the divine REVELATION ABOUT EDOM. He calls to me from Seir: »Watchman, what of the night? How much of the night is left? Watchman, what of the night?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman replies: »Morning is coming, but also the night. If you would ask, then ask; and come back yet again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the thickets of Arabia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>bring water for the thirsty. You who live in Tema, bring food for the fugitives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They flee from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and from the heat of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is what Jehovah says to me: »Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the pomp of Kedar will come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The survivors of the bowmen, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.« Jehovah, the God of Israel, has spoken!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
