In the past he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali. But in the future he will honor Galilee of the Nations, by the way of the sea, along the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The people who walk in darkness ignorancelies have seen a great light truth. A light has dawned on those who live in the land of the shadow of death the gravecalamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy. They rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as men rejoice when dividing the plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As in the day of Midians defeat, you have shattered the yoke of his burdens: the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every warriors boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. He will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on Davids throne and over his kingdom. He will establish and uphold it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts will accomplish this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah has sent a message against to Jacob and it will fall on Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All the people will know it. Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria who say with pride and arrogance of heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with cut stones. The fig trees have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehovah has strengthened Rezins foes against them and has spurred their enemies on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger has not turned away. His hand power is still stretched out extended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The people did not turn back to him who struck them, or seek Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed rush in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Elders and dignitaries are the head, and prophets who teach lies are the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Those who led this people led them astray. And those who were led by them were left in confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That is why Jehovah did not rejoice in their young people, nor show compassion to their orphans and widows.

His hand is stretched out still ready to apply his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This wickedness is like a brushfire. It burns not only briers and thorns but the forests, too. It sends up vast clouds of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The land is blackened by the fury of Jehovah of Hosts. The people are fuel for the fire, and no one spares anyone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They slice off what is on the right hand, but they will still be hungry. In the end they will even eat the flesh of their own arms offspringturn upon themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, Ephraim will feed on Manasseh, and both will devour Judah. But even then Jehovahs anger will not be satisfied. His hand is still poised to unleash his power.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
