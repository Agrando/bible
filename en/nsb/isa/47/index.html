Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans! For you will no longer be called tender and delicate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Take the millstones and grind meal. Remove your veil, strip off the skirt; uncover the leg and cross the rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Your nakedness will be uncovered and your shame will be exposed. I will take vengeance. I will not spare a man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Our Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts is His name, The Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Sit silently and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans. You will no longer be called the queen of kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I was angry with my people. I profaned my heritage and gave them into your hand. You did not show mercy to them. You made your yoke very heavy on the aged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You said: I will be a queen for a very long time! You did not consider these things or remember their outcome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Hear this you sensual one! You dwell securely and say in your heart: I am, and there is no one besides me. I will not sit as a widow. I will not lose children. (Revelation 18:2-8)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Two things will come on you suddenly in one day: Loss of children and widowhood. They will come on you in full measure in spite of your abundance of sorceries, in spite of the great power of your spells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»You felt sure of yourself in your evil. You thought that no one could see you. Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray. Then you said to yourself: I am God! There is no one else like me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Disaster will come upon you, and none of your magic can stop it. Ruin will come on you suddenly, ruin you never dreamed of!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Keep all your magic spells and charms. You have used them since you were young. Perhaps they will be of some help to you. Perhaps you can frighten your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»You are powerless in spite of the advice you get. Let your astrologers come forward and save you! Let those people who study the stars, who map out the zones of the heavens tell you from month to month what is going to happen to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Surely they are like stubble. The fire will burn them up. They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame. Here are no coals to warm anyone and no fire to sit by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»That is all they can do for you, these you have labored with and trafficked with since childhood. Each of them goes on in his error. No one can save you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
