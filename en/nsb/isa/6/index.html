The train of his robe filled the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Above him were seraphs, each with six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They called to one another: »Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of Hosts. All the earth is full of his glory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>At the sound of their voices the foundations and thresholds trembled and the Temple was filled with smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Woe to me!« I cried. »I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips a sinner and I live among a people of unclean filthy lips speechlanguage. My eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Hosts.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand. With tongs he seized it from the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He touched my mouth with it and said: »See! This has touched your lips, your guilt is taken away and your sin forgiven pardonedatoned for.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I heard the voice of Jehovah. He said: »Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?« And I said: »Here I am. Send me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said: »Go and tell this people: Hear constantly but do not understand. See constantly but do not perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»This peoples heart has become calloused. They hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.« Septuagint</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I said: »How long, O Jehovah? And He answered: »Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant, until the houses are deserted and the land is utterly desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Until Jehovah has removed men far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Even if one out of ten people are left it will be destroyed burned again. When a strong tree or an oak is cut down, a stump is left. The holy seed is the stump.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
