It will be beautiful like the Lebanon Mountains. It will be fertile as the fields of Carmel and Sharon. Everyone will see Jehovahs splendor. They will see his greatness and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Strengthen the tired hands and the knees that tremble with weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell the discouraged ones with anxious heart: »Be strong and do not be afraid! God is coming to your rescue! He is coming to punish your enemies.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the blind will be able to see, and the deaf will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The lame will leap and dance, and those who cannot speak will shout for joy. Streams of water will flow through the desert plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The parched ground will become a lake, and dry land will be filled with springs. Marsh grass and reeds will grow where jackals used to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There will be a highway there, called: »The Road of Holiness.« No sinner will ever travel that road. No fools will mislead those who follow it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>No lions will be there. No fierce animals will pass that way! Those whom Jehovah has rescued will travel home by that road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They will reach Jerusalem with gladness, singing and shouting for joy. They will be happy forever. They will be forever free from sorrow and grief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
