He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to captives and freedom to prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>To proclaim the favorable Year of Jehovah and the day of vengeance of our God. To comfort all who mourn,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>to present a garland, instead of ashes, to those who mourn in Zion, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and the mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting. They will be called oaks of righteousness. They are the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will rebuild the ancient ruins. They will raise up the former devastations. And they will repair the ruined cities, the desolations of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Strangers will stand and shepherd your flocks. Foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You will be called the priests of Jehovah. You will be spoken of as ministers of our God. You will eat the wealth of nations, you will boast in their riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Instead of your shame there will be a double portion. Instead of humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion. Therefore they will possess a double portion in their land. Everlasting joy will be theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»For I, Jehovah, love justice. I hate robbery in the burnt offering. Therefore I will faithfully give them their recompense and make an everlasting covenant with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Then their offspring will be known among the nations, and their descendants in the midst of the peoples. All who see them will recognize them because they are the blessed offspring of Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I will rejoice greatly in Jehovah. I will exult in my God for he has clothed me with garments of salvation. He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
