Cursed are those who rely on very strong warhorses, who depend on many chariots. They do not look to the Holy One of Israel. They do not seek Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He is wise and can bring about disaster. He does not take back his words. He rises against wicked people and against those who help troublemakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The Egyptians are humans, not God. Their horses are flesh and blood, not spirit. Jehovah will stretch out his powerful hand extend his power. The one who gives help will stumble. The one who receives help will fall. Both will die together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>This is what Jehovah said to me: »A lion, even a young lion, growls over its prey when a crowd of shepherds is called to fight it. It is not frightened by their voices or disturbed by the noise they make. So Jehovah of Hosts will come to fight for Mount Zion and on its hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Jehovah of Hosts will defend Jerusalem like a hovering bird. He will defend it and rescue it. He will pass over it and protect it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Return you people of Israel, return to the one whom you have so violently rebelled against.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When that day comes, all of you will reject the worthless gods of silver and gold, the idols that your sinful hands have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Assyrians will be killed with a sword not made by human hands. The swords not made by human hands will destroy them. They will flee from battle, and their young men will be made to do forced labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»In terror they will run to their stronghold, and their officers will be frightened at the sight of the battle flag.« Jehovah declares this. His fire light is in Zion and his furnace is in Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
