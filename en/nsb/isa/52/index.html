Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. The uncircumcised and defiled will not enter you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Shake off your dust! Rise up and sit enthroned, O Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains on your neck, O captive Daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For this is what Jehovah says: »You were sold for nothing, and without money you will be redeemed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord Jehovah says: »At first my people went down to Egypt to live as aliens. Now Assyria has oppressed them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»What do I have here?« Declares Jehovah. »For my people have been taken away for nothing. Those who rule them mock,« declares Jehovah. »And all day long my name is constantly blasphemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Therefore my people will all know my name! In that day they will know that it is I who foretold it. Yes, it is I!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace and who bring good tidings of good things! For they proclaim salvation and say to Zion: »Your God reigns as king!« Hebrew: Elohiym malak: God rules!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices. Together they shout for joy. They will see it with their own eyes when Jehovah returns to Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Burst into songs of joy together, you ruins of Jerusalem! Jehovah has comforted his people. He has redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah will lay bare his holy arm show his holy power in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Get out of her my people! Touch no unclean thing! Come out from it and be pure, you who carry the vessels of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You will not leave in haste or go in panic. For Jehovah will go before you. The God of Israel will be your rear guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My servant will act wisely. He will be raised, lifted up and highly exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There were many who were appalled at him and his appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He will startle amazeastonish many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
