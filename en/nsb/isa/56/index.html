No eunuch should complain: I am only a dry tree.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Jehovah says: »To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me. They hold fast to my covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will give to those within my Temple and its walls a memorial and a name that is better than sons and daughters.

They are shepherds who lack understanding. They all turn to their own way and each one seeks dishonest unjust gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Come, each one cries, let me get wine! Let us drink our fill of beer!
