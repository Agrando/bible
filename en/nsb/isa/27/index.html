He will slay Leviathan the fleeing, coiling serpent, the monster of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In that day sing about a fruitful vineyard:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I, Jehovah, watch over it. I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle. I would set them all on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Let them come to me for refuge. Let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill the entire world with fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Has Jehovah struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By warfare and exile you contend with her. With his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By this Jacobs guilt will be atoned for, and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin. When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The fortified city stands desolate, abandoned settlements, forsaken like the desert. There the calves will graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For they have no understanding discernment. Their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day Jehovah will thresh from the flowing Euphrates River to the Wadi streambed of Egypt. You, O Israelites, will be gathered up one by one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship Jehovah on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
