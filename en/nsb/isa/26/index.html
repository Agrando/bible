God makes salvation its walls and ramparts.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter, the nation that preserves truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You will keep the steadfast mind in perfect peace, because he trusts hopes in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Trust in Jehovah forever, for Jah, Jehovah, is the Rock eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty inaccessible city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Feet trample it down, the feet of the depressed, the footsteps of the poor needy.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The path of the righteous is level. O upright One, you make the way of the righteous smooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yes, Jehovah, walking in the way of your Laws, we wait for you. Your name and your fame are the desire of our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I yearn for you in the night. In the morning I long for you with all my being. When your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Grace favor is shown to the wicked, but they do not learn righteousness. In a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and do not regard the majesty of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Jehovah, your hand is lifted high, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame. Let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jehovah, you establish peace for us. All that we have accomplished you have done for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O Jehovah, our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They are now dead and they live no more. The deceased do not rise. You punished them and brought them to ruin. You wiped out all memory memorialcommemoration of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You have enlarged the nation, O Jehovah; you have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for yourself. You have extended all the borders of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah, they came to you in their distress. When you disciplined them, they could barely whisper a prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Like a woman with child and about to give birth struggles and cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, O Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We were with child, we writhed in pain, but we gave birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth. We have not given birth to people of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But your dead will live. Their bodies will rise. You, who dwell in the dust, wake up and shout for joy. Your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you. Hide yourselves for a little while until his rage has passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold! Jehovah is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will disclose reveal the bloodshed upon her. She will conceal her slain no longer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
