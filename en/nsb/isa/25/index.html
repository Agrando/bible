I will exalt you and I will praise your name! You have done wonderful things with plans formed of old. You are faithful and true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You have made the city a heap, the mighty city a ruin. The palace of aliens is a city no more. It will never be rebuilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore strong peoples will glorify you. Cities of ruthless nations will fear you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You have been a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in their distress, a shelter from the rainstorm and a shade from the heat. When the blast of the ruthless was like a winter rainstorm,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>the noise of strangers like heat in a dry place, you subdued the heat with the shade of clouds; the song of the ruthless was stilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On this mountain Jehovah of Hosts will make a feast of rich food for all peoples, a feast of well-aged wines, of rich food filled with marrow, of well-aged wines strained clear of dregs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On this mountain He will destroy the shroud that is cast over all peoples, the sheet that is spread over all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He will swallow up death forever! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces. He will take away the disgrace of His people from the earth. Jehovah has spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On that day his people will say: »This is our God! We have waited for Him and now He will save us. This is Jehovah. We have waited for Him. Let us rejoice and be glad because He will save us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovahs power will be on this mountain. Moab will be trampled beneath him like straw that is trampled in a pile of manure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Moabites will stretch out their hands in the manure like swimmers who stretch out their hands to swim. Jehovah will humble those arrogant people despite the movements of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He will bring down Moab's high-fortified walls, level them, and throw them into the dust on the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
