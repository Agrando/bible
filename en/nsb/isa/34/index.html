Gather around and listen. Let the whole earth and everyone living on it come here and pay attention.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>JEHOVAH IS ANGRY WITH ALL THE NATIONS. He is furious with all their armies. He has condemned them for destruction. He has handed them over to be slaughtered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Their dead bodies will be thrown out. A stench will rise from their corpses. The mountains will be laid waste with their blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All the stars in the sky will dissolve. The heavens will be rolled up like a scroll. The stars will fade away like leaves fall from a vine or fruit from a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My sword is covered with blood in the heavens. It will fall on EDOM and on the people I have claimed for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovahs sword is covered with blood. It is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of rams' kidneys. Jehovah will receive a sacrifice in Bozrah, a huge slaughter in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wild oxen will be killed with them, young bulls along with rams. Their land will be drenched with blood. Their dust will be covered with fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah will have a day of vengeance! He will have a year of retribution recompense in defense of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Edom's streams will be turned to tar. Its soil will be turned to burning sulfur. Its land will become blazing tar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They will not be extinguished day or night, and smoke will always go up from them. Edom will lie in ruins for generations. No one will ever travel through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pelicans and herons will take possession of the land. Porcupines and crows will live there. He will stretch the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of destruction over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There are no nobles to rule a kingdom. All of its princes have disappeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Its palaces are covered with thorns. Its fortresses have nettles and thistles. It will become a home for jackals and a place for ostriches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Hyenas will meet with jackals. Male goats will call to their mates. Screech owls will rest there and find a resting place for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Arrow snakes will make their nests there, lay eggs, and hatch them. They will gather their young under their shadow. Vultures also will gather there, each one with its mate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Search Jehovahs book and read it out loud. Not one of these animals will be missing. Not one will lack a mate, because Jehovah has commanded it, and his Spirit will gather them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He is the one who casts the lot for them, and his hand divides up the land for them with a measuring line. They will possess it permanently and live there for generations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
