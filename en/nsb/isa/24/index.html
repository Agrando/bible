Jehovah has spoken this word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The earth mourns and fades away, the world fades and withers, the exalted people of the earth mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The inhabitants of the earth pollute the earth. They transgress laws and violate statutes. They break the everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A curse devours the earth, and those who live in it are found guilty. Therefore, those living on the earth are burned, and few men are left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The new wine mourns, the vine decays and the merry-hearted sigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The joyful sound of tambourines ceases. The noise of revelers and the delight of the harp cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They no longer drink wine with a song. The beverage is bitter to its drinkers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The ruined city lies desolate. The entrance to every house is barred and none may enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the streets they cry out for wine. Joy turns to gloom and rejoicing is banished from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The city is left in ruins; its gate is battered to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They raise their voices and shout for joy. From the west they acclaim Jehovahs majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore in the east give glory to Jehovah. Exalt the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Listen to them as they sing to Jehovah from the ends of the earth: »Glory and praise to the righteous one!« But I say: »My heart is heavy with grief. I am discouraged, for evil still prevails, and treachery is everywhere.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Terror and traps and snares will be your lot, you people of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap, and those who escape the trap will step into a snare. Destruction falls on you from the heavens. The world is shaken beneath you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The earth is broken and destroyed and it is split into pieces. The earth is shaken violently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The earth reels to and fro like a drunkard and it quakes like a shack in the wind. Its transgression is heavy upon it, and it will fall, never to rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That day Jehovah will punish the host of heaven on high and the kings of the earth below.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They will be gathered like prisoners in the dungeon tower. They will be confined in prison and after many days they will be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed, For Jehovah of Hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, And his glory will be before his elders.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
