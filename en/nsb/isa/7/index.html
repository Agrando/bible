Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood and because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Aram, Ephraim and Remaliahs son have plotted your ruin. They say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»»Let us invade Judah. Let us tear it apart and divide it among us. Let us make the son of Tabeel king over Judah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»This is what the Lord Jehovah says: »It will not take place! It will not happen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»»Because the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»»The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliahs son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Again Jehovah spoke to Ahaz:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Ask Jehovah your God for a sign. Ask it in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Ahaz said: »I will not ask. I will not put Jehovah to the test.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Isaiah said: »Hear this you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore Jehovah will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel God with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He will eat butter and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah. He will bring the king of Assyria upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»In that day Jehovah will whistle for the flies that are at the distant branches of the Nile River in Egypt and for the bees that are in Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»All of them will come and settle in the deep valleys, in the cracks in the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes, and at all the water holes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»In that day Jehovah will hire the king of Assyria from beyond the Euphrates River to be a razor to shave the hair on your head, the hair on your legs, and even your beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»On that day a person will keep alive a young cow and two sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»They will give so much milk that he will have all he needs. Yes, the few survivors left in the land will have milk and honey to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»When that time comes, the fine vineyards, each with a thousand vines and each worth a thousand pieces of silver, will be overgrown with thorn bushes and briers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»People will go hunting there with bows and arrows. Yes, the whole country will be full of briers and thorn bushes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»All the hills where crops were once planted will be so overgrown with thorns that no one will go there. It will be a place where cattle and sheep graze.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
