Those who did not seek me found me. To a nation that did not call on my name, I said: Here I am, here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»All day long I held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations thoughts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»They sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil. They eat the flesh of pigs. Their pots are full of unclean meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They say: Keep away! Do not come near me, for I am too sacred for you! Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»See, it stands written before me. I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>both your sins and the sins of your fathers, says Jehovah. This is because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills. I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah says: »As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say, Do not destroy it, there is yet some good in it, so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains. My chosen people will inherit them and my servants will live there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Sharon will be pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»But as for you who forsake Jehovah and forget my holy mountain, which spread a table for the God of Fortune Babylonian diety and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I will destine you for the sword, and you will all bend down for the slaughter! I called but you did not answer. I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: My servants will eat, but you will go hungry. My servants will drink, but you will go thirsty. My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You will leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse. The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of amen, so be it truth; he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Behold! I WILL CREATE A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people. The sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years. He who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth. The sinner who reaches a hundred will be considered accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»They will build houses and dwell in them. They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people. My chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»They will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune. For they will be a people blessed by Jehovah, they and their descendants with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Before they call I will answer! While they are still speaking I will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the bull, but dust will be the serpents food. They will neither harm nor destroy on my entire holy mountain,« Jehovah proclaims.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
