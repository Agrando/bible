It is about Judah and Jerusalem at the time of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Listen, heaven, and pay attention, earth! Jehovah has spoken: »I raised my children and helped them grow, but they have rebelled against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»The bull knows its owner, and donkey knows where its master feeds it. But Israel does not know. My people do not understand!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Woe to the sinful nation, people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who are corrupt! They have forsaken Jehovah! They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They have turned away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why do you still want to be beaten? Why do you continue to rebel? Your whole head is infected. Your whole heart is sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the bottom of your feet to the top of your head there is no healthy spot left on your body. You have only bruises, sores, and fresh wounds. They have not been cleansed, bandaged, or soothed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Foreigners destroy your fields in your presence. Your fields are devastated and taken over by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My people, the daughter of Zion is left like an empty hut in a vineyard. It is like a shack in a cucumber field, like a city under attack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If Jehovah of Hosts had not left us a few survivors, we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Listen to the word of Jehovah, you rulers of Sodom! Pay attention to the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah says: »What do your many animal sacrifices mean to me? I have had enough of your burnt offerings of rams and enough fat from your fattened calves. I am not pleased with the blood of bulls, lambs, or male goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Who requires you to trample on my courtyards when you appear in my presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Do not bring any more worthless grain offerings. Your incense is disgusting to me! So are your New Moon Festivals, your days of worship, and the assemblies you call. I cannot endure your evil assemblies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I hate your New Moon Festivals and your appointed festivals. They are a burden to me. I am tired of putting up with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you. Even though you offer many prayers, I will not listen because your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Wash yourselves! Become clean! Get your evil deeds out of my sight. Stop doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Learn to do good wellright. Seek justice. Correct oppressors. Defend orphans. Plead the case of widows.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Come now, let us reason together make things rightcorrect matters between us!« Says Jehovah. »Though your sins are like scarlet, they will become as white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, they will become as white as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Refuse and rebel and swords will devour you. Jehovah has spoken.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How the faithful town has become a prostitute! She was full of justice, and righteousness lived in her. But now murderers live there!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your silver is not pure. Your beer is watered down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your rulers are rebels, friends with thieves. They all love bribes and run after gifts. They never defend orphans. They do not listen to the widows' pleas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That is why Jehovah, Jehovah of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, says: »How horrible it will be when I take revenge on my opponents! I will avenge myself against my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I will turn my power against you turn the back of my hand upon you. I will remove your impurities with bleach. I will get rid of all your worthless qualities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I will give you judges like you had long ago, advisers like you had in the beginning. After that you will be called the Righteous City, the Faithful City.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jehovahs justice will pardon Zion. Those who return will be pardoned by Jehovahs righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Rebels and sinners will be crushed at the same time. Those who abandon Jehovah will come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You will be ashamed of the oaks that you wanted to worship. You will be embarrassed by the garden that you have chosen for your gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>You will be like an oak whose leaves wither and like a garden without water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Strong people will become tinder for a fire. Their work will be the spark. Both of them will burn together. There will be no one to put out the fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
