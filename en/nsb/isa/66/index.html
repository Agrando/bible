Earth is my footstool. Where can you people build a house or resting place for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»I have made all these things. That is why all these things have come into being,« declares Jehovah. »I will pay attention to those who are humble and sorry for their sins and who tremble at my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Whoever kills a bull is like someone who kills a person. Whoever sacrifices a lamb is like someone who breaks a dog's neck. Whoever offers a grain sacrifice is like someone who offers pig's blood. Whoever burns incense is like someone who worships an idol. People have certainly chosen their own ways, and they delight in detestable things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Therefore I will choose harsh treatment for them and bring on them what they fear. I called, but no one answered. I spoke, but they did not listen. They did what I consider evil. They chose what I do not like.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Listen to the word of Jehovah, all who tremble at his word. Your brothers, who hate you, exclude you because of my name. They say: Let Jehovah show his glory and then we will see your joy. But they will be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Listen to the uproar from the city. Listen to the sound from the temple. It is the sound of Jehovah paying back his enemies as they deserve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Before a woman goes into labor, she gives birth. Before she has labor pains, she delivers a male child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a country be born in one day? Can a nation be born in a moment? When Zion went into labor, she also gave birth to her sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Do I bring a mother to the moment of birth and not let her deliver?« Asks Jehovah. »Do I cause a mother to deliver and then make her unable to have children?« Asks your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»All who love Jerusalem, be happy and rejoice with her. All who mourn for her be glad with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»You will nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breasts. You will nurse and be satisfied at her full breasts.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is what Jehovah says: »I will offer you peace like a river and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream. You will nurse and be carried in Jerusalem's arms and cuddled on her knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you. You will be comforted in Jerusalem.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When you see it, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like new grass. The power of Jehovah will be made known to his servants, but he will condemn his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah will come with fire and with his chariots like a thunderstorm. He will pay them back with his burning anger and punish them with flames of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah will judge with fire, and he will judge all people with his sword. Jehovah will strike many people dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»People make themselves holy and prepare themselves for their garden rituals. They go into the garden and devour pork, disgusting things, and mice. They will come to an end at the same time, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Because of their actions and their thoughts, I am coming to gather the nations of every language. They will come and see my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I will set up a sign among them and send some of their survivors to the nations: to Tarshish, Put and Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal, Javan, and to the distant coastlands who have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will tell about my glory among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They will bring all your brothers from every nation like a grain offering to Jehovah. They will come on horses, in chariots, in wagons, on mules and camels to my holy mountain, Jerusalem, declares Jehovah. They will come like the people of Israel who bring their grain offerings in clean dishes to Jehovahs temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I will make some of them priests and Levites, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The new heaven and earth that I am about to make will continue in my presence,« declares Jehovah. »So your descendants and your name will also continue in my presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»From one month to the next and from one week to the next all people will come to worship me,« declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Then they will go out and look at the corpses of those who have rebelled sinned against me. The worms that eat them will not die. The fire that burns them will not go out and they will disgust all humanity.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
