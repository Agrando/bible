A branch sproutshootdescendant from his roots will bear fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Spirit of Jehovah will rest on him. The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and respect for Jehovah will be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He will delight in the reverence of Jehovah. He will not judge by what his eyes see, nor make a decision by what his ears hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide with fairness for the afflicted of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth power of his words, and with the spirit breath of his lips he will destroy the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Righteousness will be the belt around his loins. Faithfulness will be the belt around His waist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The wolf will dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the young lion and the well-fed animal together. A little boy will lead them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Also the cow and the bear will graze. Their young will lie down together. And the lion will eat straw like the ox.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra. The weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They will not hurt or destroy in my entire holy mountain. This is because the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah just as the waters cover the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then in that day the nations will search for and turn to the root of Jesse. He will stand as a signal for the peoples. His resting place will be glorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then it will happen in that day that Jehovah will again recover the second time with his hand the remnant of his people. They will remain, from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He will lift up a standard for the nations and assemble the outcast ones of Israel. He will gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart. Those who harass Judah will be destroyed. Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, and Judah will not harass Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the sons of the east. They will possess Edom and Moab, and the sons of Ammon will be subject to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of the Sea of Egypt. He will wave his hand, his mighty Spirit, over the Euphrates River. He will strike it into seven streams and make men walk over on dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There will be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of his people who will be left. This will be as it was for Israel when they came up out of the land of Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
