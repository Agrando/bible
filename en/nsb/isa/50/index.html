Did I give her any to get rid of her? To which of my creditors did I sell you? You were sold because of your sins. I got rid of your mother because of your rebellion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Why was no one here when I came? Why was no one here to answer when I called? Am I too weak to reclaim you? Do I not have the power to rescue you? I dry up the sea with my command, and I turn rivers into deserts. Their fish stink because there is no water, and people die of thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I clothe the heavens in darkness and cover them with sackcloth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord Jehovah will teach me what to say, so I will know how to encourage tired people. Morning after morning he will wake me to listen like a student.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord Jehovah has opened my ears. I will not rebel, nor will I turn away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will offer my back to those who whip me. I will offer my cheeks to those who pluck hairs out of my beard. I will not turn my face away from those who humiliate me and spit on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Lord Jehovah helps me. That is why I will not be ashamed. I have set my face like a flint firm and resolute. I know that I will not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The one who pronounces me innocent is near. Who will bring a case against me? Let us confront each other! Who accuses me? Let him draw near to me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord Jehovah helps me. Who will find me guilty? They will all wear out like a garment and moths will eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who among you respects Jehovah and obeys his servant? Let those who walk in darkness and have no light trust the name of Jehovah and depend upon their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But all of you light fires and arm yourselves with flaming torches. So walk in your own light and among the torches you have lit. This is what you will receive from me: You will be tormented.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
