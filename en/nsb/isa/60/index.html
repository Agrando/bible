Your light has come, and the glory of Jehovah beams on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Darkness now covers the earth! Thick darkness overwhelms the nations. But Jehovah shines for you. His glory appears to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Nations will come to your light. Kings will come to the brightness of your illumination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Look up, look around, and watch. All of your people assemble and come to you. Your sons come from far away. Your daughters are carried in their arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Then you will see this and rejoice. Your heart will shake with joy. The riches of the sea will be brought to you. The wealth of the nations will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Many camels will cover your land, young camels from Midian and Ephah. Everyone from Sheba will come. They will bring gold and incense. They will sing the praises of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»All of the flocks from Kedar will gather and come to you. The rams of Nebaioth will serve you. They will be sacrificed as acceptable offerings on my altar. So I will honor my beautiful Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Who are these people that fly by like clouds and like doves to their nests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Surely the coastlands wait with hope for me. The ships from Tarshish are the first to bring your children from far away. They bring their silver and their gold with them to honor the name of Jehovah your God, the Holy One of Israel, because he has honored you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you. I struck you because of my anger, but in my favor I have compassion on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Your gates will always be open. They will never be closed day or night so that people may bring you the wealth of the nations. Even their kings are led as prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Nations and kingdoms that do not serve you will be destroyed. The nations will definitely be ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Lebanon's glory will come to you: Cedar, fir, and cypress trees will come to beautify my holy place. I will honor the place where my feet rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»The sons of those who oppress you will bow in front of you. All who loathe you will bow at your feet. They will call you the city of Jehovah, Zion, the city of the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»You have been abandoned and hated. No one has passed through you. But now I will make you a foundation of everlasting pride, a joy for all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»You will drink milk from other nations and nurse at royal breasts. Then you will know that I am Jehovah, your Savior, the Mighty One of Jacob, and your Defender Protector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I will bring gold instead of copper. I will bring silver instead of iron, copper instead of wood, and iron instead of stone. I will appoint peace as your governor and righteousness as your ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»You will no longer hear about violence in your land or desolation and destruction within your borders. You will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The sun will no longer be your light during the day. The brightness of the moon will not give you light, for Jehovah will be your everlasting light. Your God will be your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Your sun will no longer go down, nor will your moon disappear. Jehovah will be your everlasting light, and your days of sadness will be over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Then all your people will be righteous and they will possess the land everlastingly. They will be the seedlings I have planted, the honored work of my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The smallest of them will become a thousand. The weakest of them will become a mighty nation. At the right time I, Jehovah, will make it happen quickly.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
