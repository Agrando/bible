Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm power of Jehovah been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him. Nothing in his appearance will make us desire him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He was despised and rejected by men. He was a man of sorrows familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised. We did not consider him to be worth much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows. We considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But he was pierced for our transgressions! He was crushed for our iniquities! The punishment that brought us peace was upon him. There has been healing for us because of his wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are all like sheep. We have gone astray! Each of us has turned to his own way. Jehovah has caused the iniquity sin of all of us to be laid on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He was oppressed and afflicted and yet he did not open his mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter. He was silent like sheep ready to be sheared. He did not open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was oppressed, judged and taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? He was removed from the land of the living. He was destroyed because of the transgression of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He was buried like a criminal in a rich mans grave. He had done no wrong, nor was any deceit in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It was JehovahÂ’s will to allow him to be crushed. Even though Jehovah makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of Jehovah will prosper in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After his suffering he will see the light and be satisfied. By his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many. He will bear their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I will give him a portion among the great. He will divide the spoils with the strong. This is because he poured out his life unto death. He was numbered with the transgressors. He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
