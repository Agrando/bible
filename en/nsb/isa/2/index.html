All the nations will stream to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then many people will come and say: »Let us go to the mountain of Jehovah, to the House of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways so that we may live by them.« The law will go out from Zion. The word of Jehovah will go out from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then he will judge disputes between nations and settle matters between many people. They will beat hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nations will not fight against each other, and they will not learn war anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Come, descendants of Jacob, let us live in the light of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah, you have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob, because they are filled with Eastern influences. They practice witchcraft like the Philistines, and they make deals with foreigners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their land is full of silver and gold. There is no limit to their treasures. Their land is also full of horses. There is no limit to their chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their land is full of idols. They worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Man has been humbled. Everyman has been humiliated. Do not forgive them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go in among the rocks and hide underground because of Jehovahs terrifying presence and the magnificence of his majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The arrogant people will be humbled. High and mighty people will be brought down. On that day Jehovah alone will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All who are proud will be humbled. Jehovah of Hosts will have his day against all who are arrogant and conceited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It will also be against all the towering and mighty cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks of Bashan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>against all the high mountains and all the lofty hills,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>against every high tower and every fortified wall,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and also against all the large ships of Tarshish and all the beautiful boats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then arrogant people will be brought down. High and mighty people will be humiliated. On that day Jehovah alone will be honored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then idols false gods will disappear completely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>People will go into caves in the rocks and into holes in the ground because of Jehovahs terrifying presence and the honor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That day people will throw their silver and gold idols, that they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and the bats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They will go into caves in the rocks and into cracks in the cliffs because of Jehovahs terrifying presence and the honor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Stop trusting people, whose breath life is in their nostrils. How can they be worth anything?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
