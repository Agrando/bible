Childish tyrants will govern them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>People will oppress each other. Everyone will harass his neighbor. The young will tyrannize the old. The common people will taunt their superiors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A person will grab one of his relatives from his father's family and say: »You have a coat. You will be our leader. This pile of ruins will be under your control.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the relative will cry out: »I am not a healer! I do not have any food or a coat in my home. Do not make me a leader of the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because what they say and what they do is against Jehovah! They are defiant in his honored presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The expression on their faces will be held against them. They boast about their sins! They are like those of the people of Sodom. They do not even bother to hide them. How horrible it will be for these people. They have brought disaster on themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Tell the righteous that blessings will come to them. They will taste the fruit of their labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How horrible it will be for the wicked! Disaster will strike them. What they have done to others will be done to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Children oppress my people! Women rule over them. O My people! Those who guide you lead you astray. They confuse the direction of your paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah stands erect to assert his power. He stands to judge the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: »It is you who have devoured the vineyard. The plunder of the poor is in your houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the face of the poor?« Declares Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah also said: »Because the daughters of Zion are proud and walk with heads held high and seductive eyes, and go along with mincing steps and tinkle the bangles on their feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Jehovah will cause sores to appear on the heads of the women of Zion. Jehovah will make their foreheads bare.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On that day Jehovah will take away their fine things: jingling anklets, headbands, crescent-shaped necklaces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>pendants, bracelets, scarves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>hats, ankle bracelets, blouses, perfume boxes, charms,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>signet rings, nose rings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>fine robes, coats, shawls, purses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>mirrors, underwear, headdresses, and veils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Instead of the smell of perfume, there will be the smell of decay. They will wear ropes instead of belts. They will have baldheads instead of beautiful hair. They will wear sackcloth instead of expensive clothes. Their beauty will be scarred with brand marks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your men will be killed by the sword, in war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Her Zions gates will lament and mourn and she will sit on the ground deserted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
