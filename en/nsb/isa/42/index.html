Here is the one I have chosen, with whom I am pleased. I have filled him with my Spirit, and he will bring justice to every nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He will not shout or raise his voice or make loud speeches in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He will not break off a bent reed nor extinguish a flickering lamp. He will bring lasting justice to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He will not lose hope or courage. He will establish justice on the earth. Distant lands eagerly wait for his law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>God created the heavens and stretched them out. He fashioned the earth and all that lives there. He gave life and breath to all its people. And now Jehovah God says to his servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I, Jehovah, have called you and have given you power to see that justice is done on earth. I will make a covenant with all peoples and bring light truthlight of instruction (Psalm 27:1) to the nations through you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You will open the eyes of the blind and set free those who sit in dark prisons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I ALONE AM JEHOVAH. THAT IS MY NAME. I WILL NOT GIVE MY GLORY TO ANOTHER! I will not let idols share my praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The things I predicted have now come true. Now I will tell you of new things even before they begin to happen.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Sing a new song to Jehovah. Sing his praise, all the world! Praise him, you that sail the sea. Praise him, all creatures of the sea! Sing, distant lands and all who live there!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the desert and its towns praise God. Let the people of Kedar praise him! Let those who live in the city of Sela shout for joy from the tops of the mountains!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let those who live in distant lands give praise and glory to Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah goes out to fight like a warrior. He is ready and eager for battle. He gives a war cry, a battle shout and he shows his power against his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I kept silent for a long time. I did not answer my people. The time to act has come. I cry out like a woman in labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I will destroy the hills and mountains and dry up the grass and trees. I will turn the river valleys into deserts and dry up the pools of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I will lead my blind people by roads they have never traveled. I will turn their darkness into light and make rough country smooth before them. I will keep my promises without fail.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Those who trust in idols and call images their gods will be humiliated and disgraced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah says: »Hear, you deaf people! Look closely, you who are blind!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Is anyone more blind than my servant or more deaf than the messenger I send?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Israel, you have seen so much, but what has it meant to you? You have ears to hear with, but what have you really heard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah is a God who is eager to save. He exalted his laws and teachings, and he wanted his people to honor them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now his people have been plundered. They are locked up in dungeons and hidden away in prisons. They were robbed and plundered, with no one to come to their rescue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Will any of you listen to this? From now on will you listen with care?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave Israel up to the looters? It was Jehovah, against whom we sinned! We would not live as he wanted us to live or obey the teachings he gave us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he made us feel the force of his anger and suffer the violence of war. Like fire his anger burned throughout Israel. Yet we never knew what was happening. We learned nothing at all from it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
