I will smooth out the rough places. I will break down the copper doors and cut through the iron bars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I will give you treasures from dark places and hidden stockpiles. You will know that I, Jehovah the God of Israel, have called you by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen one, I have called you by name. I have given you a title of honor, although you do not know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I AM JEHOVAH AND THERE IS NO OTHER. THERE IS NO OTHER GOD BESIDES ME. I will strengthen you, although you do not know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»From the east to the west sunrise to sunset people will know that there is no God except me. I am Jehovah, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I make light and create darkness. I make blessings and create disasters. I, Jehovah, do all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Rain down from above, you heavens, and pour down righteousness, you skies. Let the earth open. Let salvation and righteousness sprout. Let them spring up for I Jehovah have created them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Does a clay pot dare argue with its maker, a pot that is like all the others? Does the clay ask the potter what he is doing? Does the pot complain that its maker has no skill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Do we dare say to our parents: Why did you make me like this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah, the Holy God of Israel, the one who shapes the future says: »You have no right to question me about my children or to tell me what I ought to do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I am the one who made the earth. I created human beings to live there. With my power I stretched out the heavens. I control the sun, the moon, and the stars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I have stirred Cyrus to action to fulfill my purpose and put things right. I will straighten out every road that he travels. He will rebuild my city, Jerusalem, and set my captive people free. No one has hired him or bribed him to do this.« Jehovah of Hosts has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is what Jehovah says: »The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, and those tall Sabeans will come over to you and will be yours. They will walk behind you. They will come to you in chains. They will bow down before you and plead with you. They will say: God is with you and there is no other. There is no other god!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God and Savior of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced. They will go off into disgrace together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah will save Israel with an everlasting salvation. You will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah says: »Who created the heavens? He who is God. He fashioned and made the earth. He founded it and he did not create it to be empty but formed it to be inhabited.« He says: »I am Jehovah, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness. I have not said to Jacobs descendants: Seek me in vain. I, Jehovah, speak the truth; I declare what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Come here, you refugees from the nations. Ignorant people carry wooden idols and pray to gods that cannot save anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Speak and present your case. Yes, let them consult one another. Who revealed this in the distant past and predicted it long ago? Was it not I, Jehovah? There is no other God except me. There is no other righteous God and Savior besides me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Turn to me and be saved! Turn to me all who live at the ends of the earth for I am God, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»I have bound myself with an oath. A word has gone out from my righteous mouth that will not be recalled. Every knee will bow to me and every tongue will swear allegiance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»It will be said of me: Certainly, righteousness and strength are found in Jehovah alone. All who are angry with him will come to him and be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»All the descendants of Israel will be declared righteous, and they will praise Jehovah.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
