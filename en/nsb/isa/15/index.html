Certainly in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Everyone's head is bald and every beard is cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They have dress themselves with sackcloth in their streets. On their housetops and in their squares everyone is wailing, taken down with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Heshbon and Elealeh cry out. Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud and tremble with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My heart cries out for Moab! The people have fled to the town of Zoar, and to Eglath Shelishiyah. Some climb the road to Luhith. They weep as they go. Some escape to Horonaim, grieving loudly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Brook of Nimrim is dry, the grass beside it has withered, and nothing green is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The people go across the Valley of Willows, trying to escape with all their material possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Everywhere at Moab's borders the sound of crying is heard.
