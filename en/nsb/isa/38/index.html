The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him. Isaiah said to him: »Jehovah tells you: You are to put everything in order because you will not recover. Get ready to die.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Remember, Jehovah, that I have served you faithfully and loyally. I have always tried to do what you wanted me to.« Then he cried bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jehovah commanded Isaiah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>to go back to Hezekiah and say to him: »I Jehovah, the God of your ancestor David, have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will add fifteen more years to your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I will rescue you and this city of Jerusalem from the king of Assyria, and I will continue to protect the city.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Isaiah said:« This is your sign from Jehovah that he will do what he promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»The sun made a shadow that went down the stairway of the upper palace of Ahaz. I am going to make the shadow go back ten steps.« So the sun on the stairway went back up the ten steps it had gone down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>King Hezekiah of Judah wrote this after he was sick and became well again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I thought that in the prime of my life I would go down to the gates of the grave and be robbed of the rest of my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I thought that I would not see Jehovah in this world. Even with all the people in the world, I thought I would never see another person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»My life was over. You rolled it up like a shepherd's tent. You rolled up my life like a weaver. You cut me off from the loom. You ended my life in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Until morning came, I thought you would crush my bones just like a hungry lion; both night and day you make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I cry like a swallow swift. I mourn like a dove. My eyes are red from looking to you, Jehovah. I am terribly abused. Please come and help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»There is nothing I can say in answer to you. For you are the one who has done this to me. My life has turned sour.
