He was angry with Job because he justified himself rather than God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He was angry also with Jobs three friends because they found no answer, though they had declared Job to be in the wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Elihu waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered: »I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I said: Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»But truly it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty that makes for understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»It is not the old that are wise, nor the aged that understand what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Therefore I tell you: Listen to me! Let me also declare my opinion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Listen! I waited for your words. I listened for your wise sayings, while you determined what to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I gave you my attention, but there was in fact no one that disproved Job, no one among you that answered his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Yet do not say: We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a human.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He has not directed his words against me.
