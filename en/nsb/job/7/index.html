A persons life is long and hard like that of a hired hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»It is like a worker who longs for the day to end, like a servant waiting to be paid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I am allotted months of futility, long and weary nights of misery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I go to bed and I think: »When will it be morning?« But the night drags on, and I toss till dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»My skin is clothed with worms and scabs. My flesh breaks open filled with pus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»My days are swifter than a weavers shuttle flying back and forth. They end without hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»O God, remember that my life is but a breath. I will never again see good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You see me now but not for long. Your eyes will be on me but I will be dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Just as a cloud dissipates and vanishes; those who die will not come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»They are gone forever from their home. They will not be seen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I will not keep from speaking. I must express my anguish. I must complain in my bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Am I a sea monster that you place a guard on me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»When I think: My bed will comfort me, and I will try to forget my misery with sleep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>you shatter me with dreams. You terrify me with visions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I would rather die of strangulation than go on and on like this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I hate my life. I do not want to go on living. Oh, leave me alone for these few remaining days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»What is man that you should magnify him and set your mind on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»For you examine us every morning and test us every moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»How long will you keep looking at me and let me alone till I swallow my spittle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Have I sinned?
