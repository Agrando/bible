Gods hand is heavy despite my groaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come to his seat!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I would present my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I would learn what he would answer and perceive what he would say to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Would He contend with me using his great power? No, surely He would pay attention to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»There the upright would reason with him.

He does what he wants to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He performs what is appointed for me. He is mindful of many such matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Therefore, I would be dismayed at his presence.
