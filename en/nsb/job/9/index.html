Who has hardened himself against him and prospered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He removes the mountains, and they do not know when he overturns them in his anger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»He shakes the earth out of its place and its pillars tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»He commands the sun and it does not rise! He seals off the stars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He alone spreads out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades and the chambers of the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»He does great things beyond our understanding, yes, marvelous wonders without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»He goes by me and I do not see. He moves past and I do not perceive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»He takes away and who can hinder God? Who can say to God: What are you doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»God will not withdraw his anger. The allies of the proud lie thrown down beneath him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»How then can I answer God and choose my words in order to reason with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Though I was righteous, I could not answer him! I would beg mercy of my Judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»If I called and he answered me, I would not believe that God was listening to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He crushes me with a tempest. He multiplies my wounds without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»He will not allow me to catch my breath. Yet he fills me with bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»If I speak of strength and justice, he is strong! Who will appoint my day in court?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Though I was righteous, my own mouth would condemn me. If I were blameless it would prove me perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I am blameless! Yet I do not know myself. And I despise my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»It is all one thing. Therefore I say: God destroys the blameless and the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»If the scourge slays suddenly, God laughs at the plight of the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not God, who else could it be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»My days are swifter than a runner! They flee away and see no good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»They pass by like swift ships, like an eagle swooping on its prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»If I say: I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»I am afraid of all my suffering and I know that God will not hold me innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»If I am condemned, why then do I labor in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»If I wash myself with snow water, and cleanse my hands with soap,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Yet you will plunge me into the pit, and my own clothes will abhor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»God is not a man, as I am: That I may answer him and we should go to court together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Nor is there any mediator between us who may lay his hand on us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Let God remove his rod from me. Do not let dread of him terrify me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»I would speak and not respect God. But I cannot do this!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
