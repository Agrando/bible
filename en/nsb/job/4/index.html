But who can keep from talking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Look, you have instructed many people. When hands were weak, you made them strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»When someone stumbled, you lifted him up with your words. When knees were weak, you gave them strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»But trouble comes to you, and you are impatient. It touches you, and you panic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Does your respect for God give you confidence and your lifetime of integrity give you hope?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Now think about this: Which innocent person ever died an untimely death? Find me a decent person who has been destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»When I saw those who plowed wickedness and planted misery, they gathered its harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»God destroys them with his breath and kills them with a blast of his anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The roar of the lion and the growl of the ferocious lion are loud.
