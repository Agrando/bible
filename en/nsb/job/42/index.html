Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»You said: Listen now, and I will speak. I will question you, and you shall answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I am angry with you and your two friends, because you did not speak correctly about me, as my servant Job has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You did not speak correctly about me, as my servant Job has.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what Jehovah told them. And Jehovah accepted Jobs prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>After Job had prayed for his friends, Jehovah made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble Jehovah allowed to come upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jehovah blessed the latter part of Jobs life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He also had seven sons and three daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Jobs daughters. Their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After this Job lived a hundred and forty years. He saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He died a very old man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
