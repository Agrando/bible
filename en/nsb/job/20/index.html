Therefore my understanding inspires me to reply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Do you not know from of old, ever since man was placed on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The success of the wicked is brief and the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>he will perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him will say: Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He flies away like a dream banished like a vision of the night. He cannot be found!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The eye that saw him will not see him again. His place home will look on him no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»His children must make amends to the poor. He must give back his wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»He will spit out the riches he swallowed. God will make his stomach vomit them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He will suck the poison of serpents.

He will not enjoy the profit from his trading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor and left them destitute.
