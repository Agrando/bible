Pay attention to everything I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»I am about to open my mouth. My words are on the tip of my tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»My words come from an upright heart! My lips sincerely speak what I know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The Spirit of God has made me. The Breath of the Almighty gives me life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Answer me then, if you can, and prepare yourself to confront me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I am just like you before God. I too have been taken from clay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You have said in my hearing, I heard the very words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I am pure and without sin! I am clean and free from guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Yet God has found fault with me.
