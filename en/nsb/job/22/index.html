Can even the wisest be of service to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous? Is it profitable to him if you make your ways blameless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Is it for your reverence that he reproves you, and enters into judgment with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You have indeed exacted pledges from your family for no reason, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You have given no water to the weary to drink. You have withheld bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»The powerful possess the land, and the favored live in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»You have sent widows away empty-handed. You crush the arms of the orphans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Therefore snares are around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»There is darkness so you cannot see. A flood of water covers you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how eminent they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»So you say: What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Thick clouds enwrap him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the dome of the heavens.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Will you keep to the old way that the wicked have trod?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»They were snatched away before their time. Their foundation is washed away by flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»They said to God: Leave us alone. They asked: What can the Almighty do to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Yet he filled their houses with good things. Yet the plans of the wicked are repugnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»They say: Our adversaries are cut off and the fire consumed what they left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Agree with God, and be at peace. In this way good will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored. You must remove unrighteousness from your tents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»If you treat gold like dust, and gold of Ophir like the stones of the torrent-bed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and if the Almighty is your gold and your precious silver,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and lift up your face to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You will pray to him and he will hear you! You will pay your vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you. The light of Gods favor will shine on your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»When others are humiliated, you say it is pride for he saves the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»He will deliver even those who are guilty. They will escape because of the cleanness of your hands.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
