He is like a fleeting shadow and does not endure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Do you look on such a person? Will you bring him before you for judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Mans days are determined. You have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth growth like a plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»On the other hand man dies and is laid low. He breathes his last and is no more!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Just like water that disappears from the sea or a riverbed that becomes parched and dry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so men lie down and do not rise. Until the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»If only you would hide me in the grave Sheol and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set a time for me and then remember me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my change release to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»You will call and I will answer you! You will long for the creature your hands have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»My transgressions will be sealed up in a bag. You will cover over my sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»As a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy mans hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»You overpower him once and for all, and he is gone! You change his countenance and send him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»His sons are honored and he does not know it. They are brought low and he does not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
