Why do those who know him never see his days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»The wicked remove landmarks. They seize flocks and pasture them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»They drive away the donkey of the orphan. They take the widows ox for a pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»They force the needy to yield the road. The poor of the earth all hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Like wild donkeys in the desert they go out to their toil. They search in the wasteland food for their young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»They reap in a field not their own and they glean in the vineyard of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»They are wet with the rain of the mountains. They cling to the rock in search of shelter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»There are those who snatch the orphan child from the breast. They take as a pledge the infant of the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The needy go about naked, without clothing; though hungry, they carry the sheaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Between their terraces they press out oil. They tread the wine presses, but suffer thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The dying groan from the city. The throat of the wounded cries for help. Yet God pays no attention to their prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»There are those who rebel against the light. They are not acquainted with its ways, and do not stay in its paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»The murderer rises at dusk to kill the poor and needy, and in the night is like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight. He says: No eye will see me. Then he disguises his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»In the dark they dig through houses. By day they shut themselves up. They do not know the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»For deep darkness is morning to all of them. They are friends with the terrors of deep darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Swift are they on the face of the waters. Their portion in the land is cursed! No treader turns toward their vineyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters! In the same way the grave takes those who have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»The womb forgets them. The worm finds them sweet. They are no longer remembered. Wickedness is broken like a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»They harm the childless woman, and do no good to the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power and they rise up when they despair of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»He gives them security and they are supported. His eyes are upon their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»They are exalted a little while, and then are gone. They wither and fade like everything gathered up. They are cut off like the heads of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»If it is not so, who will prove me a liar, and show that there is nothing in what I say?«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
