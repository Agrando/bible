Satan replied to Jehovah: From wandering all over the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah asked Satan: »Have you thought about my servant Job? No one in the world is like him! He is a man of integrity! He is decent and he respects God. He stays away from evil. And he still holds on to his principles. You are trying to provoke me into ruining him for no reason.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Satan answered Jehovah: »Skin for skin! Certainly, a man will give everything he has for his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»But stretch out your hand, and strike his flesh and bones and he will curse you to your face!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah told Satan: »He is in your power, but you must spare his life!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Satan left Jehovahs presence and struck Job with painful boils from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Job took a piece of broken pottery to scratch his sores as he sat in the ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>His wife asked him: »Are you still holding on to your principles? Curse God and die!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said to her: »You are talking like a godless fool. We accept the good that God gives us. Should we not also accept the bad?« Through all this Job did not speak sinful words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Job's three friends heard about all the terrible things that happened to him. Each of them came from his home: Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah, and Zophar of Naama. They agreed they would go together to sympathize with Job and comfort him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They saw him from a distance and did not even recognize him. They cried out loud and wept. Each of them tore his clothes in grief. They threw dust on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him because they saw that he was in such great pain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
