Let us determine among ourselves what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Job has said: I am innocent, and God has taken away my right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»In spite of being right I am counted a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Who is there like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Who goes in company with evildoers and walks with the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»He has said: It profits one nothing to take delight in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Hear me, you who have sense, far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»According to their deeds he will repay them. According to their ways he will make it befall them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Who gave God authority over the earth? Who has laid on him the entire world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»If He should determine to do so, If He should gather to himself his spirit and his breath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»All flesh would perish and man would return to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»But if you understand, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Shall one who hates justice rule? And will you condemn the righteous Mighty One?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Should anyone even say to a king: You good-for-nothing scoundrel! Or to nobles, you wicked people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The one who is righteous and mighty does not grant special favors to princes or prefer important people to poor people because his hands made them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»They die suddenly in the middle of the night. People have seizures and pass away. Mighty people are taken away but not by human hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»God's eyes are on a person's ways. He sees all his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness or deep shadow where troublemakers can hide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»He does not have to set a time for a person in order to bring him to divine judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»He breaks mighty people into pieces without examining them and puts others in their places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»He knows what they do, so he overthrows them at night, and they are crushed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»In return for their evil, he strikes them in public.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»This is because they turned away from following him. They did not consider any of his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»They forced the poor to cry out to him, and he hears the cry of those who suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»If God decided to do nothing at all, no one could criticize him. If he hid his face refused to assist, we would be helpless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»There would be nothing that nations could do to keep godless oppressors from ruling them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Job, have you confessed your sins to God and promised not to sin again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Have you asked God to show you your faults, and have you agreed to stop doing evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Since you object to what God does, can you expect him to do what you want? The decision is yours, not mine. Tell us now what you think.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Any sensible person will agree; and the wise that hear me will say</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that Job is speaking from ignorance and that nothing he says make sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Think through everything that Job says. You will see that he talks like an evil man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»To his sins he adds rebellion and in front of us all he mocks God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
