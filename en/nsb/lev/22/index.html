In this way they will not dishonor my holy name. I am Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Tell them: In future generations if any of your descendants, while unclean, comes near the holy offerings the Israelites set apart for Jehovah, that person must be excluded from my presence. I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»None of the descendants of Aaron who has a dreaded skin disease or a discharge may eat any of the sacred offerings until he is ritually clean.

Then he may eat the sacred offerings, which are his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He must not eat the meat of any animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by wild animals. It will make him unclean. I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»All priests must observe the regulations that I have given. Otherwise, they will become guilty and die, because they have disobeyed the sacred regulations. I am Jehovah and I make them holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of the sacred offerings. No one else may eat them, not even someone staying with a priest or hired by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»A priest's slaves, bought with his own money or born in his home, may eat the food the priest receives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»A priest's daughter who marries someone who is not a priest may not eat any of the sacred offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»A widowed or divorced daughter who has no children and who has returned to live in her father's house as a dependent may eat the food her father receives as a priest.

Whether it is from the cattle, sheep, or goats, it must be an animal that has no defects in order to be acceptable. It must never be an animal that has defects.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Do not bring Jehovah an animal that is blind, has broken bones, cuts, warts, scabs, or ringworm. Never give Jehovah any of these in a sacrifice by fire on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»You may use a bull or a sheep with a deformity or one that is stunted in growth as a freewill offering. However, it will not be accepted for a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Do not bring Jehovah an animal that has bruised, crushed, torn out, or cut out testicles. Never do any of these things to an animal in your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Never bring any kind of castrated animal received from a foreigner as a food offering for your God.
