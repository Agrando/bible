Return what you stole or seized, what you were supposed to take care of, the lost item you found,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>or whatever it was that you swore falsely about. Pay it back in full plus one-fifth more. Give it back to its owner on the day you bring your guilt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Then bring your guilt offering to Jehovah. Bring a ram that has no defects or its value in money. Bring it to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The priest will pay compensation for your wrong and make peace with Jehovah. Then you will be forgiven for whatever you did that made you guilty.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah continued to speak to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Command Aaron and his sons: These are the instructions for the burnt offering that stays on the altar overnight while the altar fire is kept burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The priest must put on his linen clothes.

He will take the ashes to a clean place outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The fire must always be burning on the altar. It must never go out.
