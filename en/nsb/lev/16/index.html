If he goes up to the canopy and stands in front of the throne of mercy on the Ark, he will die. This is because I appear in the smoke above the throne of mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»This is what Aaron must do in order to come into the holy place: He must take a bull as an offering for sin and a ram as a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»He must dress in a holy linen robe and wear linen undergarments. He must wear a linen belt and turban. These are holy clothes. He should wash his body and put them on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He will take two male goats from the congregation of Israel as an offering for sin and a ram as a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Aaron must sacrifice the bull as his own offering for sin. By doing this, he will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for himself and his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»He must take the two male goats and bring them into Jehovahs presence at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I will show Aaron which goat will be sacrificed to me and which one will be sent into the desert to the demon Azazel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»After he offers the first goat as a sacrifice for sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the other one must be presented to me alive, before he sends it into the desert to take away the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»He must offer the bull as a sacrifice to ask forgiveness for your own sins and for the sins of your family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»He will take an incense burner full of burning coals from the altar in Jehovahs presence, and two handfuls of finely ground, sweet-smelling incense. He will bring them up to the canopy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»He must place the incense on the fire in Jehovahs presence. The cloud of incense will cover the throne of mercy. This is over the words of God's promise, so that he will not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He will take some of the bull's blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the throne of mercy. Then he will sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times in front of the throne of mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Aaron will slaughter the goat for the people's offering for sin. He will take the blood inside, go up to the canopy, and sprinkle it on the throne of mercy and in front of it, as he did with the bull's blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He will pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for all the sins the Israelites committed against the holy place. These sins happened because the Israelites were unclean and because they committed rebellious acts. He will do the same for the Tent of Meeting that is among an unclean people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»No one may be in the Tent of Meeting from the time Aaron enters the holy place to do this until he comes out. Aaron will pay compensation for wrongdoing and peace with Jehovah for his own sins, his family's sins, and the sins of the entire assembly of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»He will go out to the altar in Jehovahs presence and pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for the sins committed. He will take some of the blood from the bull and some of the goat's blood and put it all around the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»With his finger he will sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times. Because the Israelites made it unclean, he will cleanse it and declare it holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»When he finishes making peace with Jehovah at the holy place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he will bring the living goat forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Aaron will place both hands on its head. He will confess over it all the sins, all the rebellious acts, and all the things the Israelites did wrong. He will transfer them to the goat's head. A man will be appointed to release the goat in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The goat will take all their sins away to a deserted place. The man must release the goat in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Aaron will go to the Tent of Meeting. He will take off the linen clothes he put on to go into the holy place, and leave them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»He will wash his body in the holy place and put on his other clothes. Then he will come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and for the people to make peace with Jehovah for his own sins and the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»He will burn the fat of the offering for sin on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The man who released the goat to Azazel must wash his clothes and his body. Then he may return to the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The bull and the goat used for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to take away sin, will be carried outside the camp and burned. Skin, meat, and intestines must all be burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»The one who burns them must wash his clothes and take a bath before he returns to camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»The following regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come. On the tenth day of the seventh month the Israelites and the foreigners living among them must fast and must not do any work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»On that day the ritual is to be performed to purify them from all their sins, so that they will be ritually clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»That day is to be a very holy day, one on which they fast and do no work at all. These regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»High Priest, properly ordained and consecrated to succeed his father, is to perform the ritual of purification. He must dress in priestly garments</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and perform the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place, the rest of the Tent of Jehovahs presence, the altar, the priests, and all the people of the community.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»These regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come. This ritual must be performed once a year to purify the people of Israel from all their sins.« So Moses did as Jehovah commanded.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
