If the hairs in it have turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a dreaded skin disease, and the priest will pronounce you unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»If the sore is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin around it and the hairs have not turned white, the priest will isolate you for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The priest will examine you again on the seventh day. If in his opinion the sore looks the same and has not spread, he will isolate you for another seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The priest will examine you again on the seventh day.

If there is a white sore on your skin that turns the hairs white and is full of pus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>it is a chronic skin disease. The priest will pronounce you unclean.
