Sacrifice them in Jehovahs presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Tell the Israelites: Take a male goat as an offering for sin, a calf and a lamb, each one-year-old and without defects, as a burnt offering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>a bull and a ram as a fellowship offering, and a grain offering mixed with olive oil to sacrifice in Jehovahs presence. Jehovah will appear to you today.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They took the things Moses commanded and brought them in front of the Tent of Meeting. The entire congregation stood in Jehovahs presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moses said: »Jehovah commanded you to offer these sacrifices so that you may see Jehovahs glory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moses told Aaron: »Come to the altar and sacrifice an offering for sin and a burnt offering to pay compensation for your sins and the sins of the people and make peace with Jehovah. Then make an offering for the people that they may pay compensation for their wrongdoing and to make peace with Jehovah just as Jehovah has commanded.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as his own offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Aaron's sons brought him the blood. He dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar. After that he poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On the altar he burned the fat, kidneys, and lobe of the liver from the offering for sin as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He burned the meat and the skin outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He slaughtered the animal for the burnt offering.

It was cut in pieces and included the head. He burned it on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He washed the internal organs and the legs and laid them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He brought the people's offerings. He took the male goat for the people's offering for sin and slaughtered it. Then he sacrificed it to take away sins as he had done before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He followed the proper procedures and brought forward the burnt offering and sacrificed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He also brought the grain offering.

He sacrificed the offering for sin, the burnt offering, and the fellowship offering. Then he came down from the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting. As soon as they came out, they blessed the people. Then Jehovahs glory appeared to all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Fire came out from Jehovahs presence and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar. As soon as all the people saw this, they shouted and bowed with their faces touching the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
