I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»If you live according to my laws and obey my commands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I will send you rain at the proper time. Then the land will produce crops and the trees will bear fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Your crops will be so plentiful that you will still be harvesting grain when it is time to pick grapes.

The sound of a windblown leaf will make them run. They will run away and fall, but no one will be chasing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»They will stumble over each other. Yet no one will be after them. They will not be able to stand up to their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»They will be destroyed among the nations. The land of their enemies will devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Those who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins and the sins of their ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»However if they confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors and the treacherous things they did to oppose me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»I will oppose them and bring them into the lands of their enemies. Then, if they humble their uncircumcised hearts and accept their guilt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»I will remember my promise to Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham. I will also remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»The land, abandoned by them, will enjoy its time to honor Jehovah while it lies deserted without them. They must accept their guilt because they rejected my rules and looked at my laws with disgust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Even when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or look at them with disgust. I will not reject or cancel my promise to them, because I am Jehovah their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»For their well being, I will remember the promise to their ancestors. I brought them out of Egypt to be their God while nations looked on. I am Jehovah!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the laws, rules, and instructions Jehovah gave to the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
