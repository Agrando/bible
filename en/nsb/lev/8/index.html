All the people gathered assembled at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moses announced to the congregation: »Jehovah has commanded that this is what you must do!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moses had Aaron and his sons come forward. Then he washed them with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He clothed Aaron with the embroidered tunic and tied the sash around him. He also dressed him in the linen robe that is worn with the ephod. He fastened the ephod to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he placed the breastplate on him and he placed the Urim and Thummim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He put the turban on Aarons head and fastened the gold medallion, the holy crown, to the front of the turban as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moses took the anointing oil to anoint the tent and everything in it and dedicate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He sprinkled the altar seven times. He anointed the altar; its utensils, the washbasin and its pedestal. This made them holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He also poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to set him apart for his holy duties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Next, Moses dressed the sons of Aaron. He put shirts on them; put sashes around their waists, and tied caps on their heads, just as Jehovah commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moses brought the young bull for the sin offering. Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moses killed it and took some of the blood. Using his finger he put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, in order to dedicate it. He then poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. In this way he dedicated it and purified it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moses took all the fat on the internal organs. He took the best part of the liver, and the kidneys with the fat on them, and burned it all on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Finally, he took the skin and the flesh of the bull, together with the food still in its stomach, and burned them outside the camp, just as Jehovah commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moses led out the ram for the sacrifice to please Jehovah. After Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moses slaughtered the ram and splattered its blood against the four sides of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The ram was cut into pieces. Moses burned the head with the other pieces and the fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He washed the internal organs and the legs. Then Moses burned the whole ram on the altar as Jehovah commanded him. It was a burnt offering, a pleasant aroma, an offering by fire to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He brought the second ram for the ordination offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the ram's head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moses slaughtered it. He took some of the blood, and put it on Aaron's right ear lobe, on his right thumb, and on the big toe of his right foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Moses also brought Aaron's sons forward. He put some of the blood on their right ear lobes, on their right thumbs, and on the big toes of their right feet. Moses threw the rest of the blood against all the sides of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He took the fat from the tail, all the fat on the internal organs, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He took a loaf of unleavened bread, a ring of bread made with olive oil. He took a wafer from the basket of unleavened bread in Jehovahs presence. He put them on the fat and the right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He placed all these things in the hands of Aaron and his sons. Moses presented all these things to Jehovah as an offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he took them from their hands and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar. These were ordination offerings, offerings by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moses also took the breast from the ram of the ordination offering and presented it to Jehovah. It was Moses' share, as Jehovah commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar. He sprinkled it on Aaron and his clothes and on his sons and their clothes. In this way he dedicated Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Moses told Aaron and his sons: »Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Take the meat and the bread in the basket of the ordination offering. Eat them there as I commanded when I said: Aaron and his sons will eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»You must burn all meat or bread that is left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»You will not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days. Do not leave until the last day of your ordination is over. It will take seven days to ordain you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I did today what Jehovah commanded me to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»You will stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and keep the watch as Jehovah directs you. Then you will not die. This is what I was commanded.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Aaron and his sons did everything Jehovah commanded through Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
