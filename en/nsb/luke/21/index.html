She gave all that she had for living expenses.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Some spoke of how wonderful the temple was. How it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus replied:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Concerning these things you see, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They asked him: »Teacher, when would these things take place? What will be the sign when these things are about to come to pass?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said: »Take heed that you are not led astray. Many will come in my name, saying, I am he but the time is not at hand. Do not follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»When you hear of wars and disturbances do not be terrified. These things must occur first. The end is not immediate.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said: »Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»There will be great earthquakes. There will be famines and pestilences in various places. There shall be terrors and great signs from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Even before all these things, they will capture you, and persecute you. You will be delivered to synagogues and prisons.

The earth will experience distress of nations in disarray for the roaring of the sea and the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Men will faint out of fear for expectation of the things coming on the world.
