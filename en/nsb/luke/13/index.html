I tell you; if you do not turn from your sins, you will die as they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»What about the eighteen people in Siloam killed when the castle tower fell on them? Do you think this proves that they were worse than all the other people living in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»It does not! I tell you if you do not turn from your sins, you will die as they did.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus told them an illustration: »There was a man who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. He looked for figs on it but found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»So he told his gardener, I have been coming here looking for figs on this tree for three years. I have not found any. So cut it down! Why should it continue using the soil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»But the gardener said: Just give it one more year, sir. I will dig around it, fertilize it and leave it alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»If the tree bears figs next year it will be good. If it does not you can have it cut down.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus was teaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A woman had an evil spirit that kept her sick for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not stand straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus called to her: »Woman you are free from your sickness!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He touched her and at once she stood straight up and praised God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The official of the synagogue was angry that Jesus healed on the Sabbath. He told the people: »There are six days in which we should work. Come during those days and be healed, not on the Sabbath!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord answered: »You hypocrites! You would untie your ox or your donkey from the stall and take it out to give it water on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Here is a descendant of Abraham whom Satan has kept in bonds for eighteen years. Should she be released on the Sabbath?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His answer shamed his enemies. The people rejoiced over the wonderful things he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus continued: »To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God? What is it like?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»It is like this. A man plants a mustard seed in his field. The plant grows and becomes a tree. The birds make their nests in its branches.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again Jesus asked: »With what should I compare the Kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>« It is like this. A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour. Soon the whole batch of dough rises.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching the people and traveling toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Someone asked him, »Will only a few people be saved?« Jesus answered them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Strive to go in through the narrow door. Many people will try to go in and will not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»The master of the house will close the door. You stand outside and knock on the door and say: Open the door for us, sir! He will answer: I do not know where you come from!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Then you will answer, we ate and drank with you. You taught in our town!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Again he will say: I do not know where you come from. Get away from me, you wicked people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»You will cry and grind your teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, while you are thrown out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»People will come from east, west, north and south and sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Some Pharisees came to Jesus and warned him: »You must leave and go somewhere else for Herod wants to kill you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus told them: »Go tell that fox I cast out demons and heal people today and tomorrow. On the third day my work will be finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>« I must go on my way today, tomorrow and the following day. It would not be right that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets! You stone those sent to you. How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her own brood under her wings. But you would not have it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Behold, your house is made desolate. I tell you, you shall not see me until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah.« (Psalm 118:26)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
