Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He spent forty days in the wilderness being tempted by the devil. He did not eat anything during those days so when it was over he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The devil said to him: »If you are the Son of God command this stone to become bread.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus answered him: »It is written, man shall not live by bread alone.« (Deuteronomy 8:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He led him up to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the devil said: »I will give all this authority and glory to you, for it has been turned over to me. I may give it to whomever I will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»If you will worship me it will all be yours.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered: »It is written, you shall worship Jehovah your God and him only shall you serve.« (Deuteronomy 6:13-15; Deuteronomy 10:12; Deuteronomy 10:20) (Exodus 20:3-5)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle highest level of the temple. Then he said to him: »If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»It is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning you to guard you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»They will carry you with their hands so you do not dash your foot against a stone.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus replied: »It is said you should not test Jehovah your God.« (Deuteronomy 6:16)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the devil had completed every temptation he departed from him for a season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus was directed by Gods Spirit to return to Galilee. His reputation spread through out the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he returned to Nazareth the place where he was raised. He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day. This was his custom. There he stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it was written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The Spirit of Jehovah is upon me. He anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind. To set at liberty those who are bruised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»To proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah.« (Isaiah 61:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Today,« he said, »you heard this scripture fulfilled.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All witnessed this and wondered at the kind words that he spoke. They said: »Is this not Josephs son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he said: »You will no doubt say this proverb to me, physician heal yourself. That which we heard was done at Capernaum do also here in your own country.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He continued: »Truly I tell you no prophet is accepted welcomedhonored in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I tell you truth. There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah. There was no rain from heaven three years and six months. There came a great famine over all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was only sent to Zarephath in the land of Sidon. She was a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet. Only one of them was cleansed, Naaman the Syrian.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Everyone in the synagogue was angry when they heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They rose up to drive him out of the city. They led him to the top of the hill where their city was built to throw him down the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he passed through the midst of them and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Next he traveled to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. There he taught them on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They were astonished at his teaching for he spoke with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>A man in the synagogue had a spirit of an unclean demon. He cried out with a loud voice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»What have we to do with you Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus rebuked him, saying: »Be quiet and come out of him.« When the demon had thrown him down in front of them, he came out of him without harming him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>All were amazed and spoke to one another. »What is he telling us? For he speaks with authority and with power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A rumor concerning him spread to every place of the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He left the synagogue and went to Simons house. Simons mother in law was suffering with a great fever. They asked him to help her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He stood over her and rebuked the fever. It left her and immediately she rose up and ministered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the sun was setting they brought many who were sick of different diseases to him. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Demons came out from many. They cried out: »You are the Son of God!« He rebuked them and charged them not to speak for they knew he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The next day he went to a secluded place. The crowds followed him. They did not want him to leave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said to them: »I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also. This is why I was sent.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
