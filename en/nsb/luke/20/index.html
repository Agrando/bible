Who gave you this authority?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus responded: »I also will ask you a question. Tell me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They reasoned among themselves, »If we say from heaven; he will say why did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»If we say from men all the people will stone us. They are persuaded that John was a prophet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they answered: »We do not know.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus said: »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He told the people an illustration: »A man planted a vineyard. He rented it to tenants and went to another country for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»At harvest time he sent a servant to the renters to collect fruit of the vineyard. The renters beat him, and sent him away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»He sent another servant who was also treated shamefully, beaten and sent away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»A third servant was sent. They wounded him and threw him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The owner of the vineyard said, what should I do? I will send my beloved son. Maybe they will respect him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»When the renters saw him they reasoned that this is the heir, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy the renters and will give the vineyard to others. When they heard it, they said, God forbid!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He looked at them and asked what does the scripture mean: The stone that the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Every one that falls on that stone shall be broken to pieces. Every one the stone falls on will be scattered as dust.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The scribes and the chief priests attempted to capture him in that very hour. They feared the people. They perceived that he spoke this illustration against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They watched him and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous. The spies listened for something in his speech to deliver him up to the authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Teacher,« they said, »we know that you are right in what you say and teach. You are not partial and do not play favorites. Rather you teach the way of God truthfully.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He perceived their craftiness, and replied:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have?« They said, »Caesars.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said to them: »Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They were not able to apprehend him in front of the people. They were amazed by his answer and kept quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Some Sadducees came to him. They believe there is no resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They asked him: »Teacher, Moses wrote if a mans brother dies and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»The same for the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»The third married her. The remaining of the seven also married her, left no children and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Afterward the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»In the resurrection whose wife shall she be? All seven married her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said, »The sons of this age marry, and are given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Those accounted worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»They cannot die anymore for they are equal to the angels. They are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Even Moses showed that the dead are raised when he was near the bush and he called Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. (Exodus 3:6-14)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live for him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Some of the scribes answered, »Teacher you have said well.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They did not dare to ask any more questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He asked them a question: »How is it that they say the Christ is Davids son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»For David said in the book of Psalms: Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»Till I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. (Psalm 110:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»David therefore called him Lord, and how is he his son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He spoke to the disciples while all the people listened:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Beware of the scribes for they walk around in long robes. They love greetings in the marketplaces. They sit in the chief seats in the synagogues and the head tables at feasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»They devour widows houses. They offer long prayers to show off in front of others. They shall receive great condemnation.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
