Ministers of Gods word delivered it to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Most excellent Theophilus Greek: Theo philos: friend of God: I have accurately traced the course of all things from the beginning. Now it seems good to me to write this report to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In this way you will know with certainty the truth that you were taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a priest named Zechariah. He was of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They were both righteous before God. They blamelessly obeyed all the commandments and ordinances of God Greek: kurios: God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They had no child for Elizabeth was barren and they both were well advanced in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He faithfully executed the priests duties before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The custom was to draw lots to see who served in the temple. It was his turn to enter into the temple of God and burn incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The whole crowd of people prayed outside at the hour of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Gods angel appeared to him when he was standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Zechariah was troubled. When he saw the angel he was filled with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Have no fear Zechariah,« said the angel, »for God has heard your prayer. Your wife Elisabeth will have a son and his name will be John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»You will be filled with joy, and many will be happy at his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»He will be great in the eyes of God. He will not drink wine or strong drink and he will be full of Holy Spirit from the time of his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Great numbers of the children of Israel will return to Jehovah their God because of him. (1 Samuel 7:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He will go before God in the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness. This will make ready a people whose hearts have been directed to Jehovah.« (Malachi 3:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Zechariah asked: »How might I be certain of this for my wife and I are old?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The angel answered: »I am Gabriel, whose place is before God. I have been sent to give you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»You will be without voice or language till the day when these things happen. Your lack of faith in what I say has caused this.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The people were waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised he was in the Temple for such a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he came out he could not speak to them. They realized he saw a vision in the temple. Instead of talking he made signs to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When the days of his priestly service ended he went home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His wife Elisabeth became pregnant. She remained in seclusion for five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She said: »This is the way God has dealt with me by taking away my reproach among men.« (1 Samuel 1:11)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The next month God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin named Mary. Mary was engaged to Joseph, a descendant of King David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Gabriel appeared to her and said: »Greetings highly favored one. God is with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>She was greatly troubled by this and wondered about the meaning of this salutation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The angel said to Mary: »Do not fear for you have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»You will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son. You will call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»He will be great. He will be called the Son of the Most High. Jehovah God will give him the throne of his father David. (Isaiah 11:1-10)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will not end.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Mary asked the angel: »How is this to be for I have had no intercourse with a man?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The angel replied: »Holy Spirit would come to you and the power of the Most High will envelope you. Because of this the newborn will be called the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Your relative Elisabeth has also conceived a son even in her old age. This so-called barren woman is in her sixth month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»When God speaks, these things are possible.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Mary said: »Look, Jehovahs servant. Let it happen to me as you spoke.« The angel departed from her. (1 Samuel 1:11)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Mary traveled with haste to the city of Judah in the hill country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>She entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elisabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When Elisabeth heard the greeting from Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. Elisabeth was filled with Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>She shouted loudly: »Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»When I heard your greeting the baby leaped in my womb for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»Blessed is she that believes. That which God spoke will be fulfilled.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Mary said: »My life magnifies Jehovah my God. (1 Samuel 2:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»My heart and mind rejoice in God my Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»He has looked on the low position of his servant. All generations from now on will call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»He that is mighty has done great things to me. Holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»His mercy is to all generations for all who respect him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»He shows strength with his arm. He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>»He removes rulers from their thrones and exalts the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>»He fills the hungry with good things and sends the rich away empty handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>»He has helped Israel his servant that he might remember mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>»He spoke to our fathers. To Abraham and his seed forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Mary stayed with Elisabeth about three months, and returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth. She gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Her neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>On the eighth day they circumcised the child. They planned to call him Zechariah, after the name of the father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>His mother spoke up and said: »He shall be called John.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>They all said: »None of your relatives are called by this name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« They were all amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Immediately his tongue loosed, his mouth opened and he spoke, blessing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Everyone nearby was in fear. These accounts spread abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>All that heard them wondered in their heart, saying, »What will this child be? For the hand of Jehovah was with him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>His father Zechariah was filled with Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>»Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel. He has visited his people and brought them redemption. (Psalm 72:18)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>»He raised up a horn of salvation power of deliverance for us in the house of his servant David</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>»He spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from ages past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>»He provided salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>»He shows mercy towards our fathers and remembers his holy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>»It was the oath he spoke to Abraham our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>»He gave us deliverance out of the hand of our enemies so we could serve him without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>»May we serve in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>»Your child will be called the prophet of the Most High. You will go in advance of Jehovah God to make his ways ready. (Malachi 3:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>»To give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>»A rising of light will visit us from on high because of the tender mercy of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>»The light will shine on them who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. It will guide our feet into the way of peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>The child grew and became spiritually strong. He lived in the deserts till the time came to show himself to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
