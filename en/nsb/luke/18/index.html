She went to him asking for legal protection from her adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»At first he refused. Then he thought about it and he said to himself, I do not fear God and have little respect for man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»However this widow bothers me. For this reason I will avenge her. If she keeps coming to me she will wear me out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Lord continued: »Pay attention to what the unrighteous judge said.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Should God avenge his chosen that cry to him day and night, and yet he is longsuffering over them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I say to you, that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, will the Son of man find faith on the earth when he comes?»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He then spoke this illustration to some who trusted in themselves. They were very self-righteous. They looked down on others:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Two men went to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The Pharisee stood and prayed like this: God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I fast twice per week. I give tithes of all that I get.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»But the tax collector stood far away and would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven. He beat his breast, saying: God, be merciful to me a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I tell you the tax collector and not the Pharisee was right with God when he went home. He who exalts himself will be humbled! He who humbles himself will be exalted!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They brought all their babes to him that he should touch them. When the disciples saw it they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said: »Invite the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them for the kingdom of God belongs to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Truly I tell you he who does not receive the kingdom of God like little child, shall in no wise enter it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A Jewish leader asked: »Good Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus asked: »Why do you call me good? None is good except one, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»You know the commandments, do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, and do not bear false witness. Honor your father and mother.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The man replied: »I have observed all these things from my youth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When Jesus heard it he said to him, »You lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he heard these things he became very sad for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Seeing him Jesus said: »It is very difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»It is easier for a camel to enter in through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They heard this and asked: »Than who can be saved?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He replied: »The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter said: »Indeed we have left our own to follow you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, no man has left house, or wife, or brother, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive manifold more now and in the age to come everlasting life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He took the twelve to Jerusalem so that the Son of man will accomplish all the things that are written through the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»He will be delivered up to the people of the nations, and will be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»They will beat and kill him. The third day he will rise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not understand for the meaning was hidden from them. They could not perceive the things he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He came closer to Jericho where a blind man sat begging by the side or the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Hearing a crowd go by, he inquired what this meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They told him: »Jesus of Nazareth passed by.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He cried out: »Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They rebuked him and said he should keep quiet. But he cried out even more: »You son of David, have mercy on me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus commanded that he be brought to him. When he was near he spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>What do you want me to do to you? He said: »Lord, give me my sight!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him: »Receive your sight! Your faith has made you whole.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people who saw it praised God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
