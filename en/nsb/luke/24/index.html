They went to the tomb with the spices that they had prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The stone was rolled away from the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When they entered they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were perplexed about what had happened. Two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>This frightened them and they bowed down prostrate on the ground. The two men said to them: »Why do you seek the living among the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»He is not here. He has arisen! Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»He said the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be impaled, and the third day rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They remembered his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them. They told these things to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These words seemed to be idle talk and they did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Peter ran to the tomb. Looking inside he saw the linen cloths by themselves. He departed to his home, wondering about that which occurred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>That day two of them traveled to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They talked between themselves about all the things that happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>While they talked and discussed together Jesus came near and walked with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes did not permit them to recognize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He asked: »What are you talking about with each other as you walk?« They stopped walking and were sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The one named Cleopas answered him: »Do you travel alone in Jerusalem and not know the things that have happened there these days?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He asked: »What things?« They said to him: »The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene. He was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»The chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death. They impaled him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»We hoped he would redeem Israel. Yes and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Some of the women of our company stunned us. They went to the tomb early.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»They did not find his body. They said that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Others with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women said. He was not there!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said to them: »You are foolish men. You are slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Did the Christ need to suffer these things and enter into his glory?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He explained to them all the Scriptures about the things concerning him. He spoke about Moses and all the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They approached the village where they were going and he appeared to be going further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They persuaded him not to go saying, »Abide with us. It is nearly evening and the day is almost gone.« He stayed with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When he had sat down with them to eat he took the bread and blessed; and breaking it he gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Their eyes were opened and they knew him. Then he vanished out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They said to each other: »Were our hearts not burning within us? When he spoke to us in the way and opened the scriptures to us?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven gathered together with others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»The Lord has risen indeed,« they said, »and he appeared to Simon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they told the things that happened in the way, how they recognized him when he broke the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As they spoke these things he stood in their midst and said: »May you have peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were afraid and supposed that they saw a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them, »Why are you troubled? And why do you question in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»See my hands and my feet that it is I. Touch me and see. A spirit does not have flesh and bones like I have.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he said this he showed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While they still did not believe him but were filled with joy and wonder, he asked for something to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He took it and ate it in front of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He said: »These are my words that I spoke to you, while I was yet with you. All things must be fulfilled. They are things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He opened their minds that they might understand the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said: »It is written that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»You are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»You see I send the promise of my Father upon you. You are to wait in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He led them out until they were near Bethany. Then he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Filled with joy, they bowed down to him in adoration. Then they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They continued blessing God in the Temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
