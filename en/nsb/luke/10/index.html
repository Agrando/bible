Pray that the Master ControllerLord of the harvest will send laborers into his harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Go your way for I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Carry no purse, no wallet, and no shoes; and greet no man on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»When you enter a house say; may this house have peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»If a son of peace lives there, your peace shall rest upon him. If not, it shall return to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Remain in that house eating and drinking what they give you. The laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not stay in different houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»When they receive you in their city eat what ever they set before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Heal the sick that are there and say to them, the kingdom of God is near you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»If they do not receive you in their city go into their streets and,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Shake off the dust that clings to your feet, from that city, so they may know that the kingdom of God came near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I tell you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Will you Capernaum be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He that hears you hears me; and he that rejects you rejects me and he that rejects me rejects him that sent me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The seventy returned with joy, saying, »Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to them: »I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any way hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Do not rejoice about this that the spirits are subject to you. Rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that same hour he rejoiced in Holy Spirit and said: »I thank you Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you did hide these things from the wise and the understanding and revealed them to babes. Father, it is pleasing in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»All things have been delivered to me from my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father. And no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Turning to the disciples, he said privately: »Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I tell you many prophets and kings desired to see the things you see and did not see them. To hear the things you hear and did not hear them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>A lawyer stood up to test him. He asked: »Teacher what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said: »What is written in the law? How do you read it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered: »Love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your life, with all your strength and with all your mind. Feelings and total existenceMight and total thinking capacity And you should love your neighbor as yourself.« (Deuteronomy 6:5) (Leviticus 19:18)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He told him: »You answered correctly, do this and you will live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Desiring to justify himself, he said to Jesus: »Who is my neighbor?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered: »A man traveled from Jerusalem to Jericho. He fell among robbers. They stripped him, beat him and left him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»A priest traveled on that road. When he saw him he passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»When a Levite came to the place he saw the man and passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Then a Samaritan arrived where he was. He was moved with compassion when he saw him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»He went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring oil and wine on them. He set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn to take care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»The next day he paid the host two shillings. He said take care of him and if you spend more I will repay you when I return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He said: »The one who showed mercy to him.« Jesus said to him: »Go and you do like wise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Along the way he entered a village. A woman named Martha received him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Her sister Mary sat at the Lords feet and heard his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Martha was worried about the housework. She approached Jesus and said: »Lord do you not care that my sister does not help me? Tell her to help me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Lord answered: »Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»However one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the proper way and it shall not be taken away from her.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
