He went to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He registered himself with Mary, who was engaged to him. She was about to become a mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger. That was because there was no room for them in the inn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Shepherds in the same country were in the field keeping watch by night over their flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Gods angel stood by them and His glory gave illumination around them and they were very afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The angel spoke to them: »Do not be afraid. Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy to all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Christ Messiah the Lord, a Savior, is born this day in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»This is the sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God, and saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Glory to God in the highest. Peace on earth among men with whom he is pleased.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The angels went away from them into heaven. Then the shepherds said to one another, »Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which God told us about.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They hurried to see the baby. They found Mary and Joseph. And they saw the baby lying in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As soon as they saw it they told what they had heard about the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All that heard it wondered at the things that were spoken to them by the shepherds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Mary remembered all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After eight days the baby was circumcised. He was called by the name, Jesus. Jesus: Jehovah is salvation This was the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Following the days of their purification according to the Law of Moses they brought him up to Jerusalem. There they would present him to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It is written in Gods law that every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to Jehovah. (Exodus 13:1, 2)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>According to Gods Law they must offer a sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for God to save Israel. Gods Holy Spirit was working in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Holy Spirit revealed to him that he would not die before he saw the Christ of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Under the power of the spirit he came to the temple. The parents brought in the child Jesus, that they obey the custom of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Let your servant depart according to your word in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»My eyes have seen your salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»That which you prepared before the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»It is a light of revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus father and mother were amazed at the things that were spoken concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother: »This child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel and for a sign that is spoken against.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»A sword will pierce through your mind that the thoughts of many hearts will be disclosed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher was a very old prophetess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>She had been a widow eighty-four years. She never left the temple. She worshipped and fasted with supplications day and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Even up to that time she gave thanks to God and spoke to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of God they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom and was blessed by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Every year his parents went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When he was twelve years old they went to the feast of the Passover, as was their custom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the feast ended they started the return trip. Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem and his parents did not know this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>They thought he was in the traveling company. After a days journey they looked for him among their relatives and friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When they could not find him they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers. He was listening and asking them questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All that heard him were amazed at his understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When they saw him they were astonished. His mother said to him: »Son, why did you treat us this way? Your father and I have searched for you and we have been worried.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He said: »Why did you look for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Fathers house?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>They did not understand what he said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He went with them to Nazareth. He remained subject to them. His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
