This is called the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The chief priests and the scribes searched for a way to put him to death. But they feared the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot. He was one of the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He went away to discuss with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver Jesus to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They were glad, and pledged to give him money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He consented and looked for a way to deliver him to them in the absence of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying: »Go make everything ready that we may eat the Passover.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They asked him: »Where do you want us to get ready?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said: »When you enter the city a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Say to the master of the house: The teacher says; where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make it ready.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They found things as he described them and they made things ready for the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When it was time he sat down with the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them: »I have earnestly wanted to eat this Passover with you before I die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I tell you I will not eat it again until it takes place in the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said: »Take this, and share it among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I say to you, I shall not drink from the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God comes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He gave thanks. Then he took the bread, broke it and gave it to them, saying: »This represents my body that is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he took the cup saying: « This represents the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Look, he who betrays me is at the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The Son of man indeed goes, as it has been determined. But woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They questioned among themselves, which of them would do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Contention grew between them concerning which of them was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He told them: »The kings of the nations have lordship over them. Those who have authority over them are called Benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»But you should not be this way. He who is the greater among you let him become as the younger. He that is chief among you is he who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Which is greater, he who sits and eats or he who serves? Is it he who sits and eats? However I am in the midst of you as he who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»You have continued with me in my temptations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»I assigned a kingdom to you just as my Father assigned it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Just as you eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»I prayed for you that your faith would not fail. Once you have turned again strengthen your brothers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said: »Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said: »I tell you Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until you deny that you know me three times.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Speaking to them he asked: »When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?« They said: »Nothing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now he said: »Take your purse and wallet. If you do not have a sword sell your cloak and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»I tell you that which is written must be fulfilled in me. He was numbered with transgressors for that which concerns me has fulfillment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They said: »Lord, here are two swords.« And he said to them: »It is enough.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He went to the Mount of Olives as was his custom and the disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he arrived he said to them: »Pray that you do not enter into temptation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He went a short distance from them and kneeled down and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He prayed: »Father if it is your will remove this cup from me, nevertheless not my will, but your will be done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>An angel came to him and gave him strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>possible spurious text He was in agony and earnestly prayed. His sweat became, as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When he finished his prayer he went to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of their sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said: »Why do you sleep? Arise and pray that you do not enter into temptation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>As he spoke a crowd followed Judas, one of the twelve. They came to him. Judas approached Jesus and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to him: »Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Those near him saw what happened and asked: »Lord shall we strike them with a sword?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>One of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said: »Do not do any more of this.« Then he touched his ear and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus spoke to the chief priests, captains of the temple and elders who came against him: »Did you come as you would against a robber with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>»I was with you every day in the temple. Yet you did not lift a hand against me. This is your hour for this power of darkness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>They seized him and led him away. They took him to the high priests house. Peter followed from a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>They kindled a fire in the midst of the court. They sat down together. Peter sat in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>A servant girl saw him sitting by the light of the fire. She looked steadfastly upon him and said: »This man was also with him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>He denied it saying: »Woman, I do not know him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>After a little while another saw him, and said: »You are one of them.« Peter replied: »Man I am not!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Another hour passed. Someone else said: »It is true this man was with him for he is a Galilean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Peter responded: »I do not know what you are talking about!« Immediately, while he spoke he heard the cockcrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him: »Before the cockcrow this day you will deny me three times.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He left there and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The men that held Jesus mocked him and beat him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>They blindfolded him, and asked him, saying: »Prophesy: who is it that struck you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>They reviled him and spoke many things against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>The next day the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together. They included chief priests and scribes. They led him away to their council, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>»If you are the Christ, tell us.« But he said to them: »If I tell you, you will not believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I ask you, you will not answer.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>»Soon the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>They all asked: »Are you the Son of God?« He said to them: »You say that I am.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>They responded: »What further need do we have for witnesses? We have heard this from his mouth.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
