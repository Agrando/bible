When he finished one of his disciples said to him: »Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He said: »When you pray say, Father holy sacredsanctifiedblessedconsecrated is your name. Let your kingdom come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Give us day-by-day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Forgive us our sins. For we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And keep us from temptation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He also said: »Which of you have a friend you would approach at midnight and say lend me three loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»This is because a friend of mine is visiting and I do not have any food to feed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You hear a voice from the house say, The door is shut, my children are in bed, do not bother me. I cannot rise and help you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I tell you even if he will not rise and give you what you need because he is your friend, he will arise and give you what you need because you keep asking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I say to you: Ask and it will be given you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Every one who asks receives. Everyone who seeks will find. It will be opened to everyone who knocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»What father would give his son a stone when he asked for a loaf? What father would give a serpent when his son asked for a fish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»If he asked for an egg would he give a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He cast out a demon from a dumb man. When the demon left the man he spoke and the crowds were astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Some of them said: »Beelzebub the prince of the demons casts out demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Others tested him demanding a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He knew their thoughts. So he told them: »Every kingdom that is divided is destroyed. A house divided against itself falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»If Satan is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand? You say I cast out demons with the help of Beelzebub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»If Beelzebub helps me cast out demons, who helps your sons cast them out? They will be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»If I use the finger powerSpirit (Exodus 31:18) (2 Corinthians 3:3) of God to cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»When the fully armed strong man guards his own palace, his goods are safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»When some one stronger comes to him and overpowers him he takes away his armor and steels his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»He who is not with me is against me. He who does not help me gather actually scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»When an unclean spirit leaves a man it passes through desolate places. It seeks rest and finds none. It says, I will return from where I came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»When he returns he finds the place swept and adorned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»He then takes seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell. The last condition of that man becomes worse than the first.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As he was talking a woman out of the crowd shouted: »Blessed is the woman who bore you and nursed you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He replied: »More blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When the crowd gathered to him, he said: »This generation is evil. It seeks a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites; the Son of man will be a sign to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation. She will condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the Wisdom of Solomon and one greater than Solomon is here now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation. They will condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and someone greater than Jonah is here now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»No man lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a bushel. He puts it on a table so those who enter may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»The lamp of your body is your eye. When your eye is clear your entire body is full of light. When it is evil your body is full of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Make sure the light that is in you is not darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If your entire body is full of light and has no darkness you will have no part of the dark. Just as a lamp when shinning brightly gives plenty of light.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As he spoke a Pharisee invited him to dine with him. He accepted the invitation and went to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The Pharisee wondered about Jesus not bathing before dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The Lord said: »You Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter. Yet your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»You foolish ones. Did he that made the outside also make the inside?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>« Give that which is within as charity. Then all things are clean for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»Woe to you Pharisees! You tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God. You should have done these but you leave them undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»Woe to you Pharisees! You love the prominent seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Woe to you! You are as the tombs that do not appear and men walk over them and do not know it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>One of the lawyers said to him: »Teacher, you also insult us by saying this.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus said: »Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to bear. And you will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»Therefore you are witnesses and consent to the works of your fathers. They killed them and you build their tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»It is for this reason the wisdom of God said, I send to them prophets and apostles and they will persecute and kill some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»The blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»This includes the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. I tell you it will be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>»Woe to you lawyers, for you took away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves and you hindered those entering.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When he left there the scribes and the Pharisees became hostile with him. They tried to quarrel with him about many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>They plotted against him and tried to catch him in something he might say.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
