He said to his disciples: »First of all, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Everything covered up will be revealed. Everything hidden will be made known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»That which you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. That which you have spoken in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I tell you my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body. After that they can do no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will show you the one to fear. Fear the one who, after he has killed, has power to destroy you throw into the ever-burning trash fires of the valley of HinnomGreek: Gehenna. This is one you should fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Are not five sparrows sold for two coins of small value? Yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I tell you, every one who confesses me before men; the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»He who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»He who speaks against the Son of man will be forgiven. However he who blasphemes against Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»When you are brought before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about what you will say to answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should say.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A member of the crowd said: »Teacher, help my brother divide the inheritance with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he said: »Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said: »Be careful, do not covet, for life does not come from your possessions.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He spoke an illustration to them: »The land of a rich man produced well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He reasoned to himself, what will I do? I have nowhere to store my fruits?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»He said: »I would pull down my barns and build larger barns. I will store all my grain and goods there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I will say to my self: You have many possessions saved for many years. Take it easy and eat, drink and be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»But God said to him: You fool this night you will give up your life. Then who will have all these things you accumulated?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»He who lays up earthly treasure for himself is not rich toward God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He told his disciples: »Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you eat or what you wear on your body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Life is more than food and clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Consider the ravens for they do not sow or reap. They have no storehouse or barn. Yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to your life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»If you are not able to do even that which is least why worry about the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Consider the way the lilies grow. They do not toil and neither do they spin. Yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»If God clothes the grasses in the field, which is here today and is cast into the oven tomorrow, how much more will he clothe you?

Your Father knows that you need them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Seek first his kingdom and these things will be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Do not fear little flock for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Sell your possessions and give to charity. Make yourselves purses that do not get old, a treasure in heaven where moth and rest cannot corrupt and thieves cannot steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Your heart will be where your treasure is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Gird your loins strengthen yourselves and light your lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Be like men looking for their master to return. He will knock when he returns from the marriage feast, and it will immediately be opened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Those servants are blessed, for the master will find them alert when he comes. I tell you he will tighten his belt, have them sit down at the table, and he will serve them the meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Even if he comes in the second watch or the third and he finds the same his servants are blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming he would have watched. He would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»You be ready! The Son of man will come at a time when you do not think he will.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Peter said: »Lord are you speaking this illustration to us or to everyone?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The Lord said: »Who is the faithful and wise steward, whom his master shall appoint over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»That servant will be blessed when his master comes and finds him doing so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»If that servant says in his heart, my master delays his coming; and beats the other servants and eats and drinks to excess,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the master of that servant will come when he does not expect. He will come in an hour that he does not know. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»The unfaithful servant who knew what his master wanted and did not do it will be beaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»He who did not know and did things unacceptable will receive a lesser punishment. To whom much is given, much will be required and to whom they commit much they will demand even more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>« I came to strike fire upon the earth and what do I care if it is already kindled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»I have a baptism to experience and I am distressed until it is accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»Do you think I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, No, instead division.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>»From now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>»They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He said to the crowd: »When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say it will rain and it does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>»When you see a south wind blowing, you say there will be scorching heat and there is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>»You hypocrites, you know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven but how is it that you do not know how to interpret this time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>»Why do you not judge what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>»For example when an opponent brings you to court, try to settle before you get there. Otherwise, he will drag you in front of a judge and the judge will hand you over to an officer who will throw you into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>»I tell you that you will not get out until you pay every penny of your fine.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
