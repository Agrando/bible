However it is a terrible thing for someone to make them happen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»It would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»So watch how you behave. Admonish your brother to repent when he sins. Forgive him when he repents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»If he sins against you seven times in one day and repents each time, you must forgive him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The apostles said to the Lord: »Increase our faith.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He answered: »If your faith was as big as a mustard seed; you could say to this mulberry tree, uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea and it would obey you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Let us say you have a servant who is plowing or looking after the sheep. Do you tell him to hurry and eat his meal when he comes in from the field?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»No you do not. You say to him get my supper ready. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. After that you may have your meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Does the servant deserve thanks for obeying orders?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The same applies to you. When you have done all you have been told to do, you say, we are unworthy servants. We have done what we ought to have done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus traveled to Jerusalem. He went along the border between Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Entering a village he met ten men suffering from a dreaded skin disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They shouted: »Jesus! Master! Have pity on us!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he saw them he told them to go show themselves to the priests. They were cleansed on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When he was healed, one of them came back and praised God in a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He fell on his face at Jesus feet and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answered: »Were all ten cleansed? Where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Were the others not willing to return with this foreigner to give glory to God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said: »Arise and go your way. Your faith has made you whole.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Pharisees asked: »When does the kingdom of God come?« Jesus answered them: »The kingdom of God does not come with observable signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Neither shall they say it is here or over there! The kingdom of God is here with you in your midstamong you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He said to the disciples: »The time will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»They will tell you go here or go there, but do not follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Just as the light from lightning shines from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, so the Son of man will be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»First he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The days of the Son of man will be like the days of Noah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»They ate, they drank and they got married until Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»The days of Lot were similar. They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted and they built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»But when Lot left Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»It will be similar in the day that the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»A man will be on the housetop. He should not go down into the house to take his possessions. He that is in the field should likewise not return to the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Remember Lots wife!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»He who seeks to gain his life will lose it. He who loses his life will preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I tell you, that on that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken learnbe received and the other will be left omitedforsaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»There will be two grinding together. One will be taken and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other will be left.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They asked him: »Where, Lord?« And he said to them: »Where the body is the eagles will also gather.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
