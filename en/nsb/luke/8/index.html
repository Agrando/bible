This included Mary Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Also healed was Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna. There were many others, who supported them out of their private substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A great crowd came to him from every city. He spoke to them with an illustration:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed some fell by the side of the road. It was trampled under foot and the birds of heaven devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Other seed fell on the rock. As soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Still other seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew with it, and choked it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Other seed fell on the good ground. It grew and produced fruit a hundredfold.« As he said these things he cried. He said: »He who has ears to hear let him hear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>His disciples asked him what this illustration means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said: »You are meant to know the secrets of the kingdom of God. I speak to the rest in illustrations, that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Now the illustration is this: The seed is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Those by the side of the road are they who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy. These have no root. They believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»The seeds that fell among the thorns are people who hear the word and go their own way. They are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and do not produce fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The good ground represents the honest and good-hearted people. They hear the word, hold fast to it and produce forth fruit with patience.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»No one lights a lamp and puts a cover over it or hides it under a bed. Instead he places it on a stand that everyone entering may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed. Nothing is secret that will not be made known and come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Pay attention and hear! Whoever has will be given more. Whoever does not have, more will be taken away, and even what he thinks he has will be taken.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>His mother and brother tried to come to him but could not because of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They told him: »Your mother and your brothers are near. They wish to see you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He answered, »My mother and my brother are these who hear the word of God, and do it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He said to his disciples: »Let us go to the other side of the lake.« Then he and his disciples boarded a boat and did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus fell asleep as they sailed to the other side. A large windstorm came to the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in danger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They awoke him saying: »Master, Master, we parish!« He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and there was calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He asked them, »Were is your faith?« They were afraid and they marveled. They asked: »Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is near Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he arrived on the shore, a demon-possessed man met him. He wore no clothes and did not live in a house but in the tombs. He had been this way a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down in front of him. He shouted in a loud voice: »What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I implore you do not torment me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The spirit seized him many times. For this reason he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the deserts. Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus asked him: »What is your name?« He answered: »Legion« for many demons had entered into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They pleaded with him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. They entreated him that he would allow them to enter into them. He gave them permission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The demons came out from the man and entered into the swine. The herd rushed down the hill into the lake, and was drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The herdsmen saw what happened and rushed to the city to tell others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They went out to see what happened. They came to Jesus and found the man who had been demon possessed. He was clothed, in his right mind and sitting at the feet of Jesus. They were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They then learned how he was possessed with demons and became whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The people of the country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart. They were very much afraid. So he boarded a boat and left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The man who once had demons asked him if he could go with him. Jesus sent him away saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Return to your house and declare the great things God has done for you.« He went throughout the whole city telling the great things Jesus had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him. They were all waiting for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue came to Jesus. He fell down at Jesus feet and implored him to come to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>His twelve-year old daughter was dying. She was his only daughter. As he went the crowds surrounded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>There was a woman having an issue of blood twelve years. She spent all her money on physicians, and could not be healed by any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>She came behind him and touched the border of his garment. Immediately the issue of blood stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jesus said: »Who touched me?« Peter and the others with him said: »Master, the people press in from all sides.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus said: »Someone did touch me. I perceived that power went from me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When the woman knew she was discovered she trembled, fell down before him and declared in the presence of all the people why she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He said to her: »Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he yet spoke someone came from the ruler of the synagogues house saying: »Your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>When Jesus heard this he said: »Do not fear, only believe and she will be made whole.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>When he arrived at the house he allowed only the mother and father of the girl, Peter, John and James to enter with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They were all weeping and morning her. He said: »Do not weep for she is not dead, but sleeps.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He took her hand and called: »Maiden, arise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Her life force returned and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given her to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Her parents were amazed. He charged them to tell no man what had been done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
