He forbids payment of tax to Caesar. He claims to be Christ a king.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Pilate asked him: »Are you King of the Jews?« He answered him: »You say it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: »I find no fault in this man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They were more insistent saying: »He excites the people throughout all Judea, beginning in Galilee even to this place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Pilate heard it, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he knew that he was from Herods jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod. He was in Jerusalem at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Herod was very happy to see Jesus. He had wanted to see him for a long time. He hoped to see him perform a miracle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He offered many questions but received no answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The chief priests and the scribes vehemently accused him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Herod with his soldiers despised him with contempt, and mocked him. They arrayed him in magnificent apparel. Then they sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Herod and Pilate became friends that day. Before that time they were at enmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said: »You brought this man to me as one who perverted the people. I examined him before you and find no fault in this man. He has not done the things you accuse him of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Herod found no fault and sent him back to us. He has done nothing worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I will therefore punish him, and release him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He must release one prisoner to them at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They cried out in unison: »Take this man away and release to us Barabbas!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He was thrown into prison for insurrection sedition in the city and murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pilate spoke to them again desiring to release Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they shouted, »Impale him! Impale him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A third time he said to them: »Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no reason to put him to death. I will therefore chastise him and release him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were insistent and spoke in loud voices asking him to impale him. And they prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pilate pronounced a sentence that what they asked for should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He released the man who was in prison for insurrection and murder and he delivered Jesus to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They led him away. Simon of Cyrene was traveling from the country. They seized him and forced him to carry the stake for Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A great crowd of people followed. Many women cried and grieved over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus turned to them and said: »Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»The days are coming when they will say blessed are the barren those without children and the breasts that never nursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Then they will say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»If they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Two criminals were to be put to death with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They came to the place called the skull. They impaled him and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said: »Father, forgive them for they do not know what they do.« This verse not found in older manuscripts. They cast lots and divided his garments among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The people stood watching while the rulers scoffed at him, saying: »He saved others let him save himself if this is his chosen, the Christ of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The soldiers mocked him and offered him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>saying: »If you are the King of the Jews save yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There was a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>One of the criminals who were hanged complained bitterly to him saying: »Are you the Christ? Save yourself and us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The other rebuked him saying: »Do you not respect God, seeing you are also condemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»We are indeed justly condemned for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man has done nothing wrong.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He said: »Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He replied: »Today I tell you this. You will be with me in paradise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It was about the sixth hour. Darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The sun failed to shine. The veil of the temple was torn in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus cried with a loud voice: »Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.« After saying this he quit breathing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The centurion saw what was done and glorified God, saying: »Certainly this was a righteous man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The crowds gathered at this sight. When they saw the things that were done they left beating their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>All of his friends and the women who followed him from Galilee stood watching from a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Joseph was a member of the council and a good and righteous man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He was from Arimathaea a city of the Jews and was looking for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth. Then he laid him in a tomb that was carved in stone. No man had ever lain in this tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>It was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath was near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The women from Galilee went with him to see the tomb and the place for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
