They were there to eat on the Sabbath. They watched him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There was in his presence a man who had the dropsy swollen arms and legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees: »Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They did not speak. So he held the man and healed him and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He said: »Which of you who has an ass or a bull that falls into a well, and will not immediately pull him up on a Sabbath day?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Again they could not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He spoke an illustration to the invited guests. He noticed they chose from the most important seats. So he said to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»When you are invited to a marriage feast do not take the place of honor. Someone more distinguished than you may be invited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Your host would tell you, give this person your place. Then you would be embarrassed and have to take the place of least honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»When you are invited, take the place of least honor. Then, when your host comes, he will tell you, friend, move to a more honorable place. And the other guests will see how you are honored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Those who exalt themselves will be humbled. And people who humble themselves will be exalted.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus said to his host: »When you give a lunch or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors. They will invite you back, and in this way you will be paid for what you did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»You will be blessed because they are not able to pay you back. God will repay you on the day the good people rise from death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>One of the guests at the table then said to Jesus: »Those who sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God will be happy!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said: »There was a man who gave a great feast to which he invited many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He sent his servant to tell the guests that everything is ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»They all made excuses one after another. The first one told the servant: I bought a field and must go and look at it. Please accept my apologies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Another said: I purchased five pairs of oxen and am on my way to try them out. Please accept my apologies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Another explained: I am newly married and I cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»The servant returned and conveyed this to his master. The master was furious. He commanded his servant to hurry into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring back the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The servant soon told his master, Your order has been carried out but there is still more room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»The master told the servant, Go to the country roads and lanes and make people come so my house will be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»None of those who were invited will taste my dinner!« He said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus turned to speak to the large crowd of people who were traveling with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»You who come to me may not be my disciple unless you love me more than you love your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters and yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Those who do not carry their own stake and come after me may not be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»If you plan to build a tower, you sit down first and figure out what it will cost. Then you see if you have enough money to finish the job.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»If you do not, you will not be able to finish the project after laying the foundation. Everyone who sees what happened will ridicule and poke fun of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»You started and could not finish, they will say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>« When a king commands ten thousand men to fight another king who comes against him with twenty thousand men, he will sit down first and decide if he is strong enough to defeat the other king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»If he is not strong enough he will send messengers to the other king to ask for terms of peace while he is still far away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Likewise,« concluded Jesus, »none of you may be my disciples unless you give up everything you have.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Salt is good. But if it loses its saltiness it cannot be made salty again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»It is neither good for the soil nor for the manure pile. You throw it away. Listen if you have ears!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
