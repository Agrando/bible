Do not take a staff or food or money. Do not even take two coats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Stay at the house you enter until you depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»If someone does not receive you, when you leave the city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against that person.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They departed and went throughout the villages preaching the good news, and healing everywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Herod the ruler of Galilee heard of all that was done and was very perplexed confusedskeptical. Some said John the Baptist was raised from the dead and that he did it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Others said that Elijah had appeared and others and that one of the old prophets had risen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Herod said: »I beheaded John, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?« He wanted to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the apostles returned they told Jesus about the things they had done. They traveled to the city of Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The crowds followed him and he welcomed them. He spoke to them about the kingdom of God. He healed many who were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As the day wore on the twelve came to him and said: »Send the people away, that they may go into the villages and country nearby to find lodging and get food, for we are here in a lonely place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said to them: »You feed them.« They replied: »We have no more than five loaves and two fishes unless we should go and buy food for all these people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They did so, and made them all sit down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He took the five loaves and the two fishes. Looking up to heaven, he blessed them and broke the bread. Then he gave them to the disciples to pass out to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They ate and were all filled. Twelve baskets of left over pieces remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>After he prayed the disciples went to him. He asked them: »Who do the crowds say that I am?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said: »John the Baptist. Others say Elijah and still others say one of the old prophets has risen again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»But who do you say I am?« He asked. Peter answered him: »The Christ of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He commanded them to tell this to no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Son of man must suffer many things, he told them. The elders, chief priests and scribes will reject him and kill him. The third day he will be raised up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He told them all: »If any man would come after me let him deny himself. Let him take up his stake of self-denial daily, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»He who would save his life shall lose it. He who would lose his life for my sake shall save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»For what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»If any man is ashamed of my teachings, and of me the Son of man will be ashamed of that person. This will happen when he comes in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»I tell you the truth, there are some here who shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>About eight days after he said these things he took Peter, John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>While he prayed his appearance changed and his clothes became white and brilliant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moses and Elijah talked to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They appeared in glory and spoke about the death he was about to experience at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Peter and his companions were very sleepy. When they awoke they saw his brilliance and the two men that stood with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Before they left Peter said to Jesus: »Master it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles. We could make one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.« He did not know what he was saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>While he said these things a cloud enveloped them and they were filled with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A voice came out of the cloud saying: »This is my Son my chosen one. Listen to him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When the voice came Jesus was found alone. They kept quiet and told no man what they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A man in the crowd cried, »Teacher, please look at my son. He is my only child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»A spirit controls him and suddenly he cries out. He foams at the mouth. It throws him into convulsions and he is badly bruised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»I asked your disciples to cast it out and they could not.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus answered: »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and put up with you? Bring your son to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When he came near the demon slammed him down and through him in to a convulsion. Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>They were all overwhelmed by the greatness of God. Everyone marveled at all the things he did. Jesus said to his disciples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Let these words sink into your ears. The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They did not understand what he said. The meaning was concealed from them. They could not comprehend it. And they were afraid to ask him about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They reasoned among themselves which of them was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When Jesus detected the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then he said to them: »Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. He who is least among you will be the greatest!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>John said: »Master we saw some one casting out demons in your name. So we prevented him from doing this because he does not follow us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said: »Do not forbid him for he that is not against you is for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>The days were approaching for his ascension. He was determined to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He sent messengers ahead of him. They entered the village of the Samaritans to get ready for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They did not receive him because he traveled to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When his disciples James and John saw this they said: »Lord, do you want us to request fire from heaven to consume them?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He turned and rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They went to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>On the way a man came to him and said: »I will follow you wherever you go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus told him: »Foxes have holes and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>He told another: »Follow me.« But he said: »Lord first let me go bury my father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>»Let the dead bury the dead. You go and publish abroad the kingdom of God.« Jesus replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Another said: »I will follow you Lord, but first let me go say good by to my relatives.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus responded: »No man, who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
