Being a short person he could not see over the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore fig-mulberry tree near where he would pass by in order to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Jesus came to the place he looked up at Zacchaeus and said: »Come down quickly for today I must visit your home.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He hurried down to receive him joyfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Many in the crowd complained saying: »He is staying with a man who is a sinner.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Zacchaeus stood before Jesus and said: »Lord, I now give half of all my possessions to the poor. If I have defrauded any one I will give back four times the amount taken.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to him: »Salvation has come to this house today. He is also a son of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were close to Jerusalem. They assumed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. Jesus responded to their assumption with an illustration.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He said: »A nobleman traveled to a country far away to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»He called ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds, and said do business with this until I return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»His citizens hated him. They sent a spokesman to him saying we do not want this man to rule us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»He received the kingdom and went back to check on his servants. He wanted to know what they had gained by trading with the money he gave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»The first reported: Your pound has made ten pounds more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He said: Well done, you good servant. You were faithful in very little. Now you shall have authority over ten cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The second said: Your pound, Lord, has made five pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»He replied: You should be over five cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Another reported: Lord, here is your pound. I kept it stored in a napkin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I feared you because you are an austere man. You take up what you do not lay down and you reap that which you did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»He said to him: Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Why did you not put my money in the bank? That way I could collect interest when I returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»The nobleman said: Take away the pound he was given and give it to him that has the ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»They said: Lord he has ten pounds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I say to you, that every one who has more shall be given. The man who does not have what little he has shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Bring my enemies that do not want me to rule over them and kill them in front of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After Jesus spoke he went to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he came close to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He told them, »Go into the nearby village. You will find a colt tied. No man has ever sat on him. Untie him and bring him to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»If any one asks why you untied him say the Lord needs him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They left and found things to be as he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The owners found them when they untied the colt and asked why do you untie the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said: »The Lord needs him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They brought him to Jesus. Then they threw their garments on the colt and Jesus sat on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As he went, they spread their garments in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He was near the descent of the Mount of Olives. The entire crowd of disciples rejoiced and praised God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They said: »Blessed is the King that comes in the name of Jehovah! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!« (Psalms 118:26; 134:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, rebuke your disciples.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He answered: »I tell you if these remain quiet the stones will cry out!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When he came close to the city he wept over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He said: »If you only knew today the things needed to bring peace! But they are hidden from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»The time is coming when your enemies will surround you and blockade you with a rampart wall on all sides. They will close in on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»They will knock you and your children down to the ground. They will not leave one stone upon another. Whats more you do not know when this visit will take place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jesus entered the temple and drove out the merchants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said: »It is written my house shall be a house of prayer. You have made it a den of robbers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Everyday he taught in the temple. The chief priests, scribes and other important men of the people looked for ways to destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>They could not find a way for the people listened to every thing he said.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
