He asked him to come and save his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They came to Jesus and earnestly pleaded with him saying: »He is worthy and you should do this for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He loves our nation and he also built our synagogue for us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus went with them. As he approached the house, the centurion sent friends to him saying, »Lord do not trouble yourself. I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I am also not worthy to come to you. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I also am a man with much authority. I am in charge of soldiers and say to this one go and he goes and to another I say come and he comes. I tell my servant to do this and he does it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus heard this and marveled at him. He turned to the crowd and said, »I tell you I find no greater faith in Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the messengers returned to the house they found the servant in good health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After that he, his disciples and a great crowd went to a city called Nain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he came near the gate of the city he saw people carrying a dead person. It was the only son of a widow. Many people were with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the Lord saw her he had sympathy for her. »Do not cry,« he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He came near the casket and touched it. The bearers stood still. He said, »Young man arise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who was dead sat up and spoke and he was returned to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They were all afraid and they praised God. They said: »A great prophet has appeared among us. God has visited inspectedselected his people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>News about him went through out all Judea and around the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The disciples of John told him the news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>John sent two of his disciples to the Lord. They asked, »Should we look for another or are you the one?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the men found him they said: »John the Baptist sent us. Are you the one who comes or should we look for another?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour he cured many diseases, plagues and evil spirits. Sight was restored to the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He answered Johns disciples: »Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard. The blind receive their sight! The lame walk and lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear! The dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Blessed is he who is not offended by me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After Johns disciples departed he told the crowd about John: »What did you go into the wilderness to find? Was it a reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»What did you go to see, a man clothed in fancy clothes? Only kings dress in fancy clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»What did you go out to see, a prophet? Yes I tell you and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»This is he of whom it is written, Behold I send my messenger before you. He will prepare a way before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»I say to you, of those who are born of women there is none greater than John. Yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When the people heard, they acknowledged Gods justice. They received their baptism from John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God and were not baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»To whom or what should I compare the men of this generation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children that sit in the marketplace and call to each other. We played the flute for you but you did not dance. We wailed and you did not weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»John the Baptist came fasting and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»The Son of man came eating and drinking, and you say look he is a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»All her children vindicate wisdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>One of the Pharisees asked him to dine with him. He went to the Pharisees house and sat down to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A sinful woman went to the Pharisees house. She brought an alabaster vase filled with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Standing by his feet weeping, she wet his feet with her tears. She wiped them with the hair of her head. Then she kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The Pharisee saw it and thought to himself if this man were a prophet he would know what kind of woman touched him. She is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to Simon: »I have something to tell you.« He replied: »What teacher?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»A certain lender had two debtors. One owed five hundred shillings and the other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»They did not have money to pay the debt so he forgave them both. Which of them did he love the most?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered: »I suppose it was the one whom he forgave the most.« Jesus said: »Your judgment is correct.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Turning to the woman, he said to Simon: »See this woman? I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet. She watered my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»You did not kiss me. Since the time I came in she has not ceased kissing my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»You did not anoint my head with oil. She anointed my feet with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»She loved much! She has many sins and they are forgiven. When little is forgiven, little love is shown.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He said to her: »Your sins are forgiven!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Those who ate with him said within themselves: »Who is this who even forgives sins?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He said to the woman: »You are saved because of your faith. Go in peace.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
