His disciples plucked the ears, rubbed them in their hands and ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Some of the Pharisees asked: »Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus answered: »Have you not read what David did when he was hungry. He and his companions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>entered into the house of God. They and the others with them ate the showbread holy bread. It is only lawful for the priest to eat it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He continued: »The Son of man is lord of the Sabbath.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath and taught. There was a man there whose right hand was withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The scribes and the Pharisees watched to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. They looked for a way to accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He knew their thoughts. So he said to the man that had the withered hand: »Stand up and come here.« He arose and stepped forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said: »I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm? Is it lawful to save a life, or to destroy it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He looked around at everyone and said to the man: »Stretch out your hand.« And he did so and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were all very angry and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He went to the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The next day he called his disciples to choose from them twelve, whom he named apostles ambassadorsmessengers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealous one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And finally there was Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He came down with them, and stood on a level place. A great crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem came to hear him. Others from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Those who were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The crowd tried to touch him for power came forth from him and healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He looked at his disciples and said: »Blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Blessed are you who hunger now for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now: for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of mans sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. For your reward is great in heaven. Your fathers treated the prophets the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Woe to you who are rich! You have received your reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Woe to you who are full now! For you will hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! You will mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Woe to you when all men speak well of you! Their fathers did the same to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»I tell you who listen, love your enemies and do good to those who hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who despitefully use you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»When someone slaps you on one cheek offer the other. Give your coat to the one who takes your topcoat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Give to every one who asks of you and do not demand back your goods from he who takes from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»As you would like men to do to you, do also to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»If you love those who love you what thanks do you have? Even sinners love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»If you do good to those who do good to you what thanks do you have? Even sinners do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what thanks do you have? Even sinners lend to sinners to receive again as much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Love your enemies and do good to them. Lend expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great. You will be sons of the Most High for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Be merciful even as your Father is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Give and it shall be given to you. You will receive a good measure. It will be pressed down, shaken together, running over and they will give it to you. For with the measure that you measure out it will be measured to you also.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He told them an illustration: »Can the blind guide the blind? Would they both fall into a pit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»The disciple is not above his teacher. Every one will be like his teacher when he is fully trained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Why do you see the speck in your brothers eye? Yet you do not consider the beam in your own eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»How can you say to your brother: Let me remove the speck in your eye when you do not notice the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»A good tree does not produce corrupt fruit and a corrupt tree does not produce good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»The identity of a tree is made clear by the fruit it produces. Men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good. The evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth that which is evil. Out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Why do you call me Lord, and do not do what I tell you to do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»He is like a man building a house. He dug and laid a deep foundation upon the rock. A flood sent a stream of water against the house and could not shake it because it was well built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»He who hears but does not do is like a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation. A flood will send a stream of water and immediately it will fall. The ruin of that house will be great.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
