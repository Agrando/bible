You leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the pasture and go looking for the one you lost until you find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»When you find it you are happy. You carry it on your shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You bring it back home. You invite your friends and neighbors together to celebrate. You say, I am so happy I found my lost sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»It is the same. I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine good people who do not need to repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Suppose a woman with ten silver coins loses one of them. What does she do? She lights a lamp and sweeps her house. She looks carefully everywhere until she finds it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»When she finds it she calls her friends and says let us celebrate. I am happy I found the lost coin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I tell you, it is the same for the angels of God who rejoice over one sinner who repents.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus said: »A man had two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The younger one said to him, Father I want my share of the property. He divided his property between his two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»In a short time the younger son sold his share of the property. He left home with the money and traveled to a far away country where he wasted his money in reckless living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He spent everything! When a famine spread over that country he was left with nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»He went to work for a citizen of that country who sent him to his farm to take care of the pigs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He wanted to eat the Carob bean pods the pigs ate, but no one gave him anything to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Finally it dawned on him, my fathers hired workers have more than they can eat and I am about to starve!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I will go to my father and say: Father I have sinned against God and against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I am not fit to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired workers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»He went to his father. He was a long way from home when his father saw him. His heart filled with pity. He ran and threw his arms around his son and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Father, the son said: I have sinned against God and against you. I am not fit to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The father called his servants. He said: Hurry and bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Get the prize calf and kill it. Let us celebrate with a feast!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»My son was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he has been found. The feasting began.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»The older son was out in the field. When he came close to the house he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>« He asked one of the servants what was happening?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Your brother returned home, the servant answered. Your father killed the prize calf because he has returned safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»The older brother was so angry he would not enter the house. His father came out and begged him to come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»He spoke to his father in anger. All these years I have worked like a slave for you. I have never disobeyed you. What have you given me? Not even a goat for me to have a feast with my friends!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»This son of yours wasted all your property on prostitutes. When he comes home you kill the prize calf for him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»The father answered, »My son, you are always here. And everything I have is yours!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»We had to celebrate and be happy. Your brother was dead. Now he is alive! He was lost and now he has been found!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
