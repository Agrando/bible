The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing their nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He boarded one of the boats. It was Simons boat. He asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When he finished speaking he asked Simon to put into deep water and let down the nets for a catch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Simon answered, Master we worked all night and caught nothing. At your word I will let down the nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they did this they caught a large number of fish and their nets were breaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They called their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They filled both boats until they began to sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Simon Peter saw this he fell down at Jesus knees. He said: »Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon: »Do not fear. From now on you will catch men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After they brought their boats to land they left all and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One time while he was in one of the cities a man full of leprosy fell on his face before Jesus. He said: »Lord, if you want to you can make me clean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He stretched forth his hand and touched him, saying: »I want to, be made clean.« Immediately the leprosy departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He told him to tell no one and go and show himself to the priest. Then he was to make a cleansing offering, just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The news about him spread far away and large crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He withdrew to a quiet place and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One day when he was teaching, Pharisees and doctors of the Law were in the crowd. People came from every village of Galilee, Judea and Jerusalem. Gods power was with him to heal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Men brought a man on a bed. He was paralyzed. They tried to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd. So they went up to the housetop and let the man and the bed down through the tiles to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Seeing their faith, Jesus said: »Man your sins are forgiven you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The scribes and the Pharisees reasoned saying: »Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus perceived their reasoning and said to them: »Why do you reason in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or arise and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»So you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins,« he said to the man who was paralyzed, »I say to you, arise, take up your bed and go to your house.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Immediately he rose up before them, took his bed and departed to his house, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Everyone was amazed and they glorified God. They were filled with fear. They said: »We have seen strange things today.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After that he met a tax collector named Levi sitting at his place of business. He told him: »Follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He gave up everything and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Levi made him a great feast in his house. There was a large group of tax collectors and of others that were sitting at the meal with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Pharisees and their scribes complained to Jesus disciples. They asked: »Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them: »Those who have good health do not need a physician. The sick do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»I did not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said: »The disciples of John fast often and make supplications. So do the disciples of the Pharisees. But yours eat and drink.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus replied: »Could you make the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»The days will come and when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He told an illustration to them: »No one takes a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise he will tear the new. Also the new will not match the old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»No one puts new wine in old wine skins. The new wine will burst the old skins and spill the wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»After drinking old wine no one desires the new for the old is better.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
