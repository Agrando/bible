That Achaia has been prepared since last year. Your zeal stirred up many of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But I have sent the brothers that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect. Even as I said, you may be prepared:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lest by any means, if any from Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to speak of you, should be put to shame in this respect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I thought it necessary therefore to request the brothers to go before me to you, and prepare your generous gift before hand, that the same might be ready as a gift and not extortion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will reap bountifully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let each man do according as he has purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>God is able to make all grace abound toward you. You have plenty of everything you need and should abound in every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As it is written: He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor. His righteousness abides forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You will be made rich in everything. And you can be generous on every occasion. This will cause thanksgiving to God through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This service not only takes care of the needs of the holy ones, but also abounds with many expressions of thanksgiving to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The proof of this ministry is that they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the good news of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
