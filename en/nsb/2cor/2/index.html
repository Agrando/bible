It is the same one whom I made sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I wrote this very thing that when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice. I have confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears. Not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have more abundantly for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part that I press not too heavily to you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sufficient to such a one is this punishment that was inflicted by the many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excess sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I urge you to confirm your love toward him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I write for this purpose, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whoever you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I had no relief for my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother: but leaving them, I went to Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thanks to God, who always leads us in triumph triumphal procession in Christ. He makes known through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God. We are an aroma for those who are saved and those who perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the one an aroma of death leading to death and to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God; but sincere and from God. We speak in Christ in the sight of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
