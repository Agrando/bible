We wronged no person. We wronged and corrupted no one. We took advantage of no person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I say it not to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Great is my confidence in you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in our entire affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When we came to Macedonia our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side, fighting on the outside and fears on the inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Nevertheless he who comforts the lowly, even God, comforted us by the coming of Titus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>This is not by his coming only, but also by the comfort he brought from you. He told us about your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me so that I rejoiced yet more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it for I see that that letter made you sorry, though but for a season,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I now rejoice, not because you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance; for you were made sorry after a godly fashion, that you might not suffer loss by us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For godly sorrow works repentance leading to salvation. This is a repentance that brings no regret: but the sorrow of the world works death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This very thing that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it made in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, yes what vindication! You demonstrated yourself to innocent in the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Although I wrote to you, I did not write for the sake of the one who did wrong, nor for the one who suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest to you in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. We enjoyed our comfort the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because all of you have refreshed his mental disposition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If in anything I have boasted about him to you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our boasting also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His affection is even greater for you as he remembers your obedience and how with reverence and trembling you received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice that in everything I am encouraged because of you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
