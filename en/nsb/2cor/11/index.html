For I promised you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds will be lead away from the simplicity and the purity cleanness that is toward Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If someone comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different good news, which you did not accept, you do well to put up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For I do not consider myself inferior to the super apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not in knowledge. We have in every way made this evident to you in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you the good news of God without charge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I robbed other congregations, taking pay from them that I might minister to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man. For the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will continue to do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me from doing this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why? Is it because I do not love you? God knows I do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that in whatever matter they boast, they may be found equal with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder for even Satan fashions himself into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, let no man think me foolish. If you do, yet receive me as foolish that I also may boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You being wise tolerate the foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You suffer, if a man brings you into bondage, if a man devours you, if a man takes advantage of you, if a man exalts himself, if a man strikes you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. If any are bold, I speak foolishly for I am also bold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool. I am more in labors more abundant, beaten beyond number, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, I suffered shipwreck three times, a night and a day I have spent in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brothers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In weariness and painfulness, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Beside those things that are from the outside, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the congregations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I do not burn with indignation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I need to boast, I will boast about the things that concern my infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed forever knows I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The governor under King Aretas put guards around the city of Damascus to catch me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
