First they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But as you have plenty of everything, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love for us, see that you have plenty of this undeserved kindness also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But now complete the doing. There was the eager will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he does not have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I do not say this for the ease of others and for your affliction</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But thanks to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth to you of his own accord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we have sent together with him the brother, whose praise in the good news has spread through all the congregations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and not only so, but who was also appointed by the congregations to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to show our readiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Avoid this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty that is ministered by us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for we think of honorable things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>We send our brother with them, whom we have many times proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you or our brothers, they are the messengers of the congregations, and they are the glory of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Show to them as representatives of the congregations the quality of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
