I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago whether in the body, I do not know; or whether out of the body, I do not know; God knows, such a one caught up even to the third heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I know such a man whether in the body, or apart from the body, I do not know; God knows,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will brag about this person, but I will not brag about myself unless it is about my weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If I ever wanted to brag, I would not be a fool. Instead, I would be telling the truth. But I am going to spare you so that no one may think more of me than what he sees or hears about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I was given a painful physical ailment that will keep me from being puffed up with pride because of the many wonderful things I saw. It acts as Satan's messenger to beat me and keep me from being proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Three times I prayed to God about this and asked him to take it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He told me: »My grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness.« Most gladly therefore, I would rather glory in my infirmities frailities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me cover me like a tentdescend upon meabide with me. (Isaiah 40:29-31)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become a fool in boasting. You have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended about you: for in nothing am I inferior to the most prominent apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>What is it in which you were inferior to other congregations, except that I was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you. I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you. The children should not provide for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will gladly spend and be spent for you. When I love you more abundantly should I be loved less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Just the same, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I gain you by any of them whom I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus gain you? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same mental disposition? Did we not walk in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for youre up building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I am afraid that I may come and find you different from what I want you to be, and that you may find me different from what you want me to be. I fear that there may be rivalry, jealousy, hot tempers, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly conduct.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am afraid that the next time I come my God will humiliate me in your presence, and I shall weep over many who sinned in the past and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication and loose conduct that they have practiced.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
