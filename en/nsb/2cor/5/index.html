It is an everlasting house in the heavens, not made with human hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In this we sigh in silent prayer, longing to be clothed with our habitation that is from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Indeed being clothed we will not be found naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>While in this tabernacle we groan and sigh with prayer. We are concerned that we would be clothed with what is mortal and be swallowed up devoured by this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He that prepared us for this very purpose is God. He gave the Spirit to us as a guarantee pledgesecurity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are always confident for we know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We walk by faith, not by sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We are of good courage, I say, and are willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether it is good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We know what it means to respect the Lord so we persuade others. God knows us and I hope that you know us in your hearts consciences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We are not again commending ourselves to you. But we are giving you an occasion to be proud of us. That way you may have an answer for those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if we are beside ourselves crazyinsane it is to God. If we are of sound mind, it is to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the love of Christ compels us to judge, that one died for all and therefore all died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for their sakes and rose again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From now on we know no man according to the flesh: even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things have passed away. Behold, they have become new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ. He gave the ministry of reconciliation to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ. He was not imputing their trespasses against them, for he had committed the word of reconciliation to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ that you be reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He made the one who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf. That way we might become the righteousness of God in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
