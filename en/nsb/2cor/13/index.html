The testimony of two or three witnesses must uphold an accusation. (Deuteronomy 19:15)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I told you in advance as if I were present the second time. Being absent now I write to those who have sinned and to all others. If I come again I will not spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you but is mighty in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Though he was impaled through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. We are weak through him also, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith. Prove your own selves. Do you not know this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is with you, unless you are disqualified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we may seem disqualified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong.
