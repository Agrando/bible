We destroy false arguments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>We cast down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God. We bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are ready to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You look at the things that are before you. If any man trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself that, even as he is Christ's, so also are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I should boast a great deal concerning the authority the Lord gave us to build you up, and not to tear you down, I would not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong. But his bodily presence is weak and his speech of no account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let a person like this take this into account: what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such we will also be in deed when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves. But they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves. They are without understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not boast beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the province that God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are not overstretching ourselves though we did not reach to you. We reached out to you with the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We did not boast beyond our assignment in other men's labors. Having hope that, as your faith grows, we shall be made great among you according to our territory for further abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let us preach the good news to the parts beyond you. Let us not boast in someone elseÂ’s territory in concerning things ready for our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who boasts let him boast in Jehovah! (Jeremiah 9:24)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is not he that commends himself that is approved. It is the one whom Jehovah commends. (Proverbs 29:26)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
