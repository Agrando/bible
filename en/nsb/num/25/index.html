The people ate and bowed down to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So Israel joined itself to Baal of Peor. Jehovah was angry against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehovah said to Moses: »Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before Jehovah so that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moses said to the judges of Israel: »Each of you put to death those men who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>One of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman to his brothers. He did this right in front of Moses and the entire congregation of Israel while they were crying at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of the priest Aaron, saw this. He left the assembly and grabbed a spear in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He went into the tent after the Israelite man. He drove the spear through the man and into the womans body. Because of this, the plague that the Israelites were experiencing stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Twenty-four thousand people died from that plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah continued speaking to Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah said to Moses: »Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of the priest Aaron, turned my fury away from the Israelites. Since he stood up for me, I did not have to stand up for myself and destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Tell Phinehas that I now make a promise of peace to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»My promise is that he and his descendants will be priests for a very long time because he stood up for his God. He made peace with Jehovah for the Israelites.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The name of the Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri, son of Salu. Salu was the leader of a family from Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi, daughter of Zur. Zur was the head of a family from the Midianite tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah said to Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Treat the Midianites as your enemies, and kill them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»This is because they treated you as enemies. They plotted to trick you in the incident that took place at Peor. They used their sister Cozbi, daughter of a Midianite leader, who was killed on the day of the plague caused by the incident at Peor.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
