So he attacked them and captured some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then the Israelites made a vow to Jehovah: »If you will let us conquer these people, we will unconditionally dedicate them and their cities to you and will destroy them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah heard them and helped them conquer the Canaanites. The Israelites completely destroyed them and their cities, and named the place Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They moved from Mount Hor following the road that goes to the Red Sea. That way they could go around Edom. The people became impatient on the trip</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and criticized God and Moses. They said: »Why did you make us leave Egypt only to let us die in the desert? There is no bread or water, and we cannot stand this awful food!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah sent poisonous snakes among the people. They bit the people, and many of the Israelites died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The people came to Moses and said: »We sinned when we criticized Jehovah and you. Pray to Jehovah so that he will take the snakes away from us. So Moses prayed for the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah said to Moses: »Make a snake and put it on a pole. Anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moses made a copper snake and put it on a pole. People looked at the copper snake after they were bitten and lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Israelites moved and set up camp at Oboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After leaving that place, they camped at the ruins of Abarim in the wilderness east of Moabite territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they camped in Zered Valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They moved again and camped on the north side of the Arnon River, in the desert that extends into Amorite territory. The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That is why The Book of Jehovahs Battles speaks of the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the valleys; the Arnon River,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the slope of the valleys that extend to the town of Ar and toward the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From there they went on to a place called Wells, where Jehovah said to Moses: Bring the people together, and I will give them water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The people of Israel sang this song: »Wells, produce your water; And we will greet it with a song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The well dug by princes and by leaders of the people, dug with a royal scepter and with their walking sticks. They moved from the wilderness to Mattanah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and from there they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of the Moabites, below the top of Mount Pisgah, looking out over the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»The people of Israel sent messengers to the Amorite king Sihon to say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Let us go through your country. We will not go through any of your fields or vineyards or drink any of the water from your wells. We will stay on the kings highway until we have passed through your territory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all his troops and came out into the desert to attack Israel. When Sihons troops came to Jahaz, they fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Israel defeated them in battle and took possession of their land from the Arnon Valley to the Jabbok River. They stopped at the border of the Ammon because it was fortified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns. They settled in the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>King Sihon ruled from Heshbon after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon River gorge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That is why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon: »Come and rebuild Heshbon, King Sihons capital city!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»His armies marched out like fiery flames, burning down the town of Ar and destroying the hills along the Arnon River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»You Moabites are done for! Your god Chemosh deserted your people. They were captured, taken away by King Sihon the Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»We completely defeated Moab. The towns of Heshbon and Dibon, of Nophah and Medeba are ruined and gone.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>After the Israelites settled in the Amorite territory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Moses sent some men to explore the town of Jazer. Some time later, the Israelites captured the villages surrounding it and forced out the Amorites who lived there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They turned around and went by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people for battle at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jehovah said to Moses: »Do not fear him for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land. You will do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Israelites defeated him, his sons, and all his troops, leaving no survivors. They took possession of his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
