They were on the plains of Moab east of the Jordan River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Balak, son of Zippor, saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The Moabites were very afraid because there were so many Israelites. Also, the Moabites did not like these people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the Moabites said to the leaders of Midian: »All those people will eventually eat up everything around us the same way cattle eat up the grass in a field. At that time Balak, son of Zippor, was king of Moab.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He sent messengers to summon Balaam, son of Beor, who was at Pethor, on the Euphrates River, in the land where his people lived. Balaks message was: »A nation has just come here from Egypt. They have spread out all over the countryside and are setting up their camp here in front of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»They outnumber us, so please come and put a curse on them for me. Then maybe we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that when you pronounce a blessing, people are blessed, and when you pronounce a curse, they are placed under a curse.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The elders of Moab and Midian left. They took money with them to pay for Balaams services. They came to Balaam and told him what Balak had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Spend the night here,« Balaam said to them, »and I will report to you what Jehovah tells me.« So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God came to Balaam and asked: »Who are these men with you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Balaam answered: »Balak, son of King Zippor of Moab, sent them with this message:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Some people came from Egypt and are spreading out all over the countryside. Now come and curse them for me. Maybe I will be able to fight them and force them out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>God said to Balaam: »Do not go with them! Do not curse these people. They are blessed!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Balaam got up in the morning, he said to Balaks princes: »Go back to your own country. Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Moabite princes went back to Balak and said: »Balaam refused to come with us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Balak sent a larger group of more highly respected princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When they came to Balaam they said to him: »This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I will make sure you are richly rewarded. I will do whatever you ask. Please, come and curse execrate these people for me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Balaam answered Balaks servants: »Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not disobey the command of Jehovah my God no matter whether the request was important or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Now, please stay here tonight, as the others did, and I will find out what else Jehovah may have to tell me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That night God came to Balaam and said: »If these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and left with the Moabite princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>God became angry that he was going. So the angel of Jehovah stood in the road to stop him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The donkey saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the road with his sword drawn. The donkey turned off the road into a field. Balaam hit the donkey to get it back on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Where the road went through the vineyards, it was narrow, with stonewalls on both sides. Now the angel of Jehovah stood there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The donkey saw the angel and it moved over against the wall and crushed Balaams foot against it. Again Balaam beat the donkey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Once more the angel moved ahead. He stood in a narrow place where there was no room at all to pass on either side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down. Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jehovah gave the donkey the power of speech. The donkey said to Balaam: »What have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Balaam answered: »It is because you have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The donkey replied: »Am I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life? Have I ever treated you like this before?« »No,« he answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jehovah let Balaam see the angel standing there with his sword. Balaam threw himself face down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The angel demanded: »Why have you beaten your donkey three times like this? I have come to bar your way, because you should not be making this journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If it had not, I would have killed you and spared the donkey.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Balaam replied: »I have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you think it is wrong for me to go on I will return home.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the angel said: »Go on with these men, but say only what I tell you to say.« Thus Balaam went on with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Balak heard that Balaam was coming. He went to meet him at Ar, a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Balak said to him: »Why did you not come when I sent for you the first time? Did you think I was not able to reward you enough?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Balaam answered: »I am here now. But now, what power do I have? I can say only what God tells me to say.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, from where Balaam could see a part of the people of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
