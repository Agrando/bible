Then bring me seven bulls and seven rams.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Balak did as he was told. He and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Balaam said to Balak: »Stand here by your burnt offering. I will go to see whether or not Jehovah will meet me. I will tell you what he reveals to me.« So he went alone to the top of a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>God met him and Balaam said to God: »I have built the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah told Balaam: »Go back to Balak and give him my message.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He went back to Balak and found him standing beside his burnt offering with all the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Balaam delivered this message: »Balak brought me from Aram. The king of Moab summoned me from the eastern mountains. Come and curse Jacob for me,« he said. Come and condemn Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I condemn those whom Jehovah has not condemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I see them from the top of rocky cliffs. I look at them from the hills. I see a nation that lives by itself! These are people who do not consider themselves to be like other nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The descendants of Jacob are like specks of dust. Who can count them or number even one-fourth of the people of Israel? Let me die the death of innocent people. Let my end be like theirs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Balak responded to Balaam: »What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but all you have done is bless them!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Balaam answered: »I must say what Jehovah tells me to say.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Balak said: »Please come with me to another place, where you can see the Israelites. You will see only some of them, not all of them. Curse them for me from there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he took him to the Field of Zophim on top of Mount Pisgah. He built seven altars there. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Balaam said to Balak: »Stay here beside your burnt offering while I meet with God over there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah met Balaam and told him what to say. He sent him back to Balak to give him his message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he returned and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering. He was with the leaders of Moab. Balak asked what Jehovah said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Balaam uttered this prophecy: »Come, Balak son of Zippor, and listen to what I have to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»God is a not man that he should lie. He is not a son of man who changes his mind. Does he ever promise and not fulfill? Does he ever speak and not act?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I have been instructed to bless. And when God blesses, I cannot call it back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»He has not observed wickedness in Jacob. Nor has he seen trouble in Israel! Jehovah his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»God brings them out of Egypt. He is for them like the horns of the wild bull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»For there is omen spell against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel. At the proper time it will be said to Jacob and Israel: What God has done!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Behold, the nation of Israel! It is like a mighty lion: It will rise and not lie down again until it has torn and devoured its pray. It will drink the blood of those it has killed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Balak said to Balaam: »You refuse to curse malign the people of Israel, but at least do not bless them!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Balaam answered: »Did I not tell you that I must do everything Jehovah tells me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Balak replied: »Come with me. I will take you to another place. Perhaps God will be willing to let you curse them for me from there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So he took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor overlooking the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Balaam said to him: »Build seven altars for me here and bring me seven bulls and seven rams.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Balak did as he was told. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
