It was made exactly like the one Jehovah had shown Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah said to Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites. Make them clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»This is what you must do to make them clean: Sprinkle them with water to take away their sins. Make them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. Then they will be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»They must take a young bull and the grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil that is offered with it. You must take a second young bull as an offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting. Assemble the whole congregation of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Then bring the Levites into Jehovahs presence, and the Israelites will place their hands on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Aaron will present the Levites to Jehovah as an offering from the Israelites. Then they will be ready to do Jehovahs work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The Levites will place their hands on the heads of the young bulls. Sacrifice one of them as an offering for sin and the other one as a burnt offering to Jehovah. These sacrifices will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Make the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons, and present them as an offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»In this way you will separate the Levites from the other Israelites. The Levites will be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Once you have made them clean and presented them as an offering, the Levites may come and do their work at the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»They will be the only Israelites given to me. I have taken them to be mine as substitutes for every firstborn male offspring of the Israelites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»When I killed all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated as my own the oldest son of each Israelite family and the first-born of every animal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I am now taking the Levites instead of all the first-born of the Israelites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons, as a gift from the Israelites. They are to work in the tent for the people of Israel and to protect the Israelites from the disaster that would strike them if they came too near the Holy Place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moses, Aaron, and all the people of Israel dedicated the Levites, as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Aaron dedicated them as a special gift to Jehovah. He also performed the ritual of purification for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The people did everything Jehovah commanded Moses concerning the Levites. Thus the Levites were qualified to work in the tent under Aaron and his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jehovah said to Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»From the age of twenty-five each Levite shall perform his duties in the tent of my presence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»They must retire from active service when they are fifty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»They may assist the other Levites in their duties at the tent of meeting. But they may not do any regular work. This is how you will handle the Levites duties.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
