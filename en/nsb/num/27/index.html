Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They came to Moses and stood in front of him, the priest Eleazar, the leaders, and the entire congregation at the entrance to the tent of meeting. They said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Our father died in the desert. He was not a part of Korahs followers who joined forces against Jehovah. He died for his own sin and left no sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Why should our fathers name be allowed to die out in his family because he had no son? Give us property among our fathers relatives.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Moses brought their case to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah said to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Zelophehads daughters are right. You must give them property of their own among their fathers relatives. Turn their fathers property over to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Tell the Israelites: If a man dies and leaves no sons, turn his property over to his daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»If he has no daughters give his property to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»If he has no brothers give his property to his uncles on his fathers side of the family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»If he has no uncles, give his property to the nearest relative in his family. That relative will take possession of it. This will be a rule for the Israelites, as Jehovah commanded Moses.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jehovah said to Moses: »Go up into the Abarim Mountains, and take a look at the land I will give the Israelites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»After you see it, you, too, will join your ancestors in death, as your brother Aaron did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»You both rebelled against my command in the Desert of Zin. You did not show the people how holy I am when they were complaining at the oasis. »This was the oasis of Meribah at Kadesh in the Desert of Zin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moses prayed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»O Jehovah our God, source of all life, appoint, I pray, a man who can lead the people</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and can command them in battle. Do not allow your congregation to be like sheep without a shepherd.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah said to Moses: »Take Joshua son of Nun, a capable man, and place your hands on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Have him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the entire congregation, and there before them all proclaim him as your successor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Give him some of your authority, so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»He will depend on Eleazar the priest, who will learn my will by using the Urim and Thummim. In this way Eleazar will direct Joshua and the whole congregation of Israel in all their affairs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. He had Joshua stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moses put his hands on Joshuas head and proclaimed him as his successor, just as Jehovah proclaimed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
