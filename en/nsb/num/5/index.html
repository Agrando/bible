They must not make this camp where I live among you unclean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus the Israelites did as Jehovah told Moses. They sent these unclean people outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah said to Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Tell the Israelites: If you do something wrong to another person, you have been unfaithful to Jehovah. When you realize your guilt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>you must confess your sin, pay in full for what you did wrong, add one-fifth to it, and give it to the person who was wronged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»There may be no heir to whom the payment can be made. In that case, the payment for what you did wrong must be given to Jehovah for the priest to use. This payment is in addition to the ram that is used to pay compensation for the wrongdoing makes peace with Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Any contribution over and above the holy offerings that the Israelites bring to the priest belongs to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Each persons holy offerings will belong to that person. Everything given to the priest will belong to the priest.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Speak to the Israelites and say: A mans wife may have been unfaithful to him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and may have had sexual intercourse with another man without her husbands knowledge. She may have kept it secret if there were no witnesses to accuse her and she was not caught in the act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»A husband may have a fit of jealousy and suspect his wife, whether she was actually unfaithful or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»He must then take his wife to the priest along with eight cups of barley flour as an offering for her. He must not pour olive oil on the flour or put frankincense on it, since it is a grain offering brought because of the husbands jealousy. It is an offering used for a confession, to remind someone of a sin that was committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»The priest will have the woman come forward and stand in Jehovahs presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The priest will then take holy water in a piece of pottery and put some dust from the floor of the tent into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The priest will bring the woman into Jehovahs presence and loosen her hair. In her hands he will put the offering used for a confession, that is, the grain offering brought because of the husbands jealousy. The priest will hold the bitter water that can bring a curse in his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The priest will say to her: If no other man has had sexual intercourse with you and you have not been unfaithful to your husband, you are not guilty. This bitter water that can bring a curse will not harm you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»If you have indeed been unfaithful and have had sexual intercourse with another man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Jehovah will make you an example for your people to see what happens when the curse of this oath comes true: Jehovah will make your uterus drop and your stomach swell. Then the priest will administer the oath and the curse by saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»May this water that can bring a curse go into your body and make your stomach swell and your uterus drop!« Then the woman will say: »Amen!« »Amen!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»The priest will write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»He will have the woman drink the bitter water that can bring the curse. This water will go into her and become bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»The priest will take the grain offering she was holding. He will present it to Jehovah, and bring it to the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The priest will take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar. Then he will have the woman drink the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»If she has become unclean by being unfaithful to her husband, the water that can bring the curse will go into her and become bitter. Her stomach will swell, her uterus will drop, and she will become cursed among her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»However if the woman is not unclean and is pure, she is not guilty and will be able to have children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»These are the instructions for how to deal with jealousy. They tell you what to do when a woman is unfaithful to her husband and becomes unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»They also tell you what to do when a husband has a fit of jealousy and is suspicious of his wife. He will make his wife stand in Jehovahs presence. The priest will do everything these instructions tell him to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»The husband is not guilty of doing anything wrong. But the woman will suffer the consequences of her sin.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
