They may be burnt offerings or any other kind of sacrifice. They may be offered to fulfill a vow, as a freewill offering, or as one of your festival offerings. They may be cattle, sheep, or goats. These are offerings that are a soothing pleasantrestful aroma to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Whoever presents the offering must also give Jehovah a grain offering of eight cups of flour mixed with one quart of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»With each sheep or goat for the burnt offering or any other sacrifice, also give an offering of one quart of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»With a ram, give a grain offering of sixteen cups of flour mixed with one and one quarter quarts of oil</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and an offering of one and one quarter quarts of wine. Offer them as a soothing aroma to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»When you sacrifice a young bull as a burnt offering to Jehovah or make any other kind of sacrifice to keep a vow or as a fellowship offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Offer with the young bull a grain offering of twenty-four cups of flour mixed with two quarts of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Also give an offering of two quarts of wine. It is an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Do this for each bull, each ram, and each sheep or goat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Do it for each animal, however many you sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»All native-born Israelites must do it this way when they bring an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Make a food offering, an odor that pleases Jehovah. If foreigners live among you, whether on a temporary or a permanent basis, they are to observe the same regulations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»For all time to come, the same rules are binding on you and on the foreigners who live among you. You and they are alike in Jehovahs sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»The same laws and regulations apply to you and to them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah gave Moses</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>the following regulations for the people of Israel. They are to observe them in the land he was going to give them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»When any food produced there is eaten, some of it is to be set aside as a special contribution to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»When you bake bread, the first loaf of the first bread made from the new grain is to be presented as a special contribution to Jehovah. This is to be presented in the same way as the special contribution you make from the grain you thresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»For all time to come, this special gift is to be given to Jehovah from the bread you bake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Suppose someone unintentionally fails to keep some of these regulations Jehovah gave Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Also suppose that in the future the congregation fails to do everything Jehovah commanded through Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»If the mistake was made because of the ignorance of the congregation, they are to offer a bull as a burnt offering, an odor that pleases Jehovah. Use the proper grain offering and wine offering. In addition, they are to offer a male goat as a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»The priest will perform the ritual of purification for the congregation. They will be forgiven since the mistake was unintentional and they brought their sin offering as a food offering to Jehovah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The whole congregation of Israel and the foreigners living among them will be forgiven, because everyone was involved in the mistake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»If any of you sin unintentionally, you should offer a one-year-old female goat as a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»The priest shall perform the ritual of purification at the altar to purify you from your sin. You will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»The same regulation applies to all who unintentionally commit a sin, whether they are native Israelites or resident foreigners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Any who sin deliberately, natives or foreigners, are guilty of treating Jehovah with contempt. They shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»They have rejected what Jehovah said and have deliberately broken one of his commandments. They are responsible for their own death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>One time, while the Israelites were still in the wilderness, a man was found gathering firewood on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He was taken to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They held him in custody until they decided what to do with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jehovah said to Moses: »This man must be put to death. The whole congregation must take him outside the camp and stone him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the whole congregation took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jehovah said to Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Speak to the Israelites and tell them: »For generations to come they must wear tassels on the corners of their clothes. Each tassel should have violet threads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»When you look at the threads in the tassel, you will remember all Jehovahs commandments and obey them. Then you will not do whatever you want and go after whatever you see, as if you were chasing after prostitutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»You will remember to obey all my commandments. You will be holy to your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am Jehovah your God!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
