He also commanded you to give the property of our relative Zelophehad to his daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Remember, if they marry men of another tribe, their property will then belong to that tribe, and the total allotted to us will be reduced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»During the Year of Restoration, when all property that has been sold is restored to its original owners, the property of Zelophehads daughters will be permanently added to the tribe into which they marry and will be lost to our tribe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Moses gave the people of Israel the following command from Jehovah.
