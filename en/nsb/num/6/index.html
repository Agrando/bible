They must never eat fresh grapes or raisins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»As long as they are Nazirites they must never eat anything that comes from a grapevine, not even grape seeds or skins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»As long as they are under the Nazirite vow no razor may touch their heads. During the entire time that they are dedicated to Jehovah as Nazirites, they will be holy. They must let their hair grow long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»While they are dedicated to Jehovah as Nazirites, they must never go near a dead body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Even if their own father, mother, brother, or sister dies, they must not make themselves unclean by going near them.
