The cloud came to rest in the wilderness of Paran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah gave the command through Moses for them to march.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They were in the same order each time they moved. Those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Judah started out first, company by company, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nethanel son of Zuar was in command of the tribe of Issachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Eliab son of Helon was in command of the tribe of Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the tent would be taken down. The clans of Gershon and Merari carried it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Next, the banner of the division led by the tribe of Reuben would start out, company by company. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was in command of the tribe of Simeon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Eliasaph son of Deuel was in command of the tribe of Gad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Levite clan of Kohath started the march.
