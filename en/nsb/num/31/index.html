After that you will join your ancestors in death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Moses said to the people: »Your men must get ready to go to war against the Midianites. Jehovah will use them to get even with Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Send one thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus one thousand men from each tribe were supplied from the divisions of Israel, twelve thousand men ready for war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moses sent them off to war. There were one thousand men from each tribe along with Phinehas, son of the priest Eleazar. Phinehas took with him the holy articles and the trumpets for the fanfare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They went to war against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses, and killed every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Included in those killed were the five kings of Midian-Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam, son of Beor, in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Israelites took the Midianite women and children as prisoners of war. They also took all their animals, their livestock, and their valuables as loot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They burned the cities where the Midianites lived and all their settlements.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They took everything as loot including all the people and animals,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and brought the prisoners of war, the loot, and everything to Moses, the priest Eleazar, and the congregation of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moses, the priest Eleazar, and all the leaders of the congregation went outside the camp to meet them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of the companies and battalions, who were returning from battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moses asked them: »Have you spared all the women?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Look, these women caused the Israelites, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor. Thus the congregation of Jehovah experienced the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»So kill all the Midianite boys and every Midianite woman who has gone to bed with a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»But keep alive for yourselves every girl who has never gone to bed with a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Everyone who killed a person or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp seven days. You and your prisoners of war must use the ritual water on the third and seventh days in order to take away your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»You must do the same for all the clothes and everything made of leather, goats hair, or wood.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle: »This is what Jehovahs Law told Moses to do:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Only the gold and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin and the lead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it will be clean. It must be purified with water for impurity. Anything that cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»You must wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean. After that you may enter the camp.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehovah spoke to Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the families of the congregation take a count of the booty that was captured, both of man and of animal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and the entire congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Levy a tax for Jehovah from the men of war who went out to battle, one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, as an offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»From the sons of Israels half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys and of the sheep, from all the animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The booty that remained from the spoil the men of war had plundered was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and seventy-two thousand cattle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and sixty-one thousand donkeys,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and of human beings, of the women who had not known man intimately, all the persons were thirty-two thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The half, the portion of those who went out to war, was as follows: the number of sheep was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jehovahs levy of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There were thirty-six thousand cattle, from which Jehovahs levy was seventy-two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>There were thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, from which Jehovahs levy was sixty-one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There were sixteen thousand human beings, from whom Jehovahs levy was thirty-two persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Moses gave the levy that was Jehovahs offering to Eleazar the priest, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And from the Israelites half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The congregations half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and thirty-six thousand cattle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and the human beings were sixteen thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animals from the Israelites half. He gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, just as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>They said to Moses: »Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»So we brought as an offering to Jehovah what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and ankle bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of molded articles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>All the gold of the offering they gave to Jehovah, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Each of the men of war had taken booty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
