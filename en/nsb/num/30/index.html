He must do everything he said he would do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»A young girl, who still lives in her fathers house, might make a vow to Jehovah that she will do something or swear an oath that she will not do something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»She must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her father raises an objection when he hears about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»If her father forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. Jehovah will forgive her, because her father refused to let her keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»If an unmarried woman makes a vow, whether deliberately or carelessly, or promises to abstain from something, and then marries,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»If her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. Jehovah will forgive her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»A widow or a divorced woman must keep every vow she makes and every promise to abstain from something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»If a married woman makes a vow or promises to abstain from something,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>her husband may hear about it but may say nothing and not object. Then her vow or oath must be kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»But if her husband cancels it when he hears about it, nothing she said in her vow or oath has to be kept. Her husband has canceled it. Jehovah will free her from this vow or oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»A husband decides whether or not his wife has to keep any vow to do something or any oath to do without something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»If he says nothing to her about it day after day, this means he decided that she must keep her vow or oath. She must keep it because he said nothing to her when he heard about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»If he cancels it later, he will suffer the consequences.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are the laws Jehovah gave Moses for husbands and wives, and for fathers with young daughters still living at home.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
