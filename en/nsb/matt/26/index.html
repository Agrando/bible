At that time the Son of man will be captured and impaled.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The chief priest and the elders of the people assembled at the court of Caiaphas, the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All of them, using deceit, worked together to capture Jesus and kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They insisted: »Not during the feast; it could start a riot among the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A woman came to him having an alabaster vase containing very precious ointment. She poured it upon his head while he was eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The disciples saw it and were indignant. »To what purpose is this waste?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»This ointment could have been sold for much and the money given to the poor.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus was aware of this and said: »Why do you trouble the woman? Her expression to me was good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The poor are always with you, but I am not always with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»She poured this ointment on my body to prepare me for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I tell you, Everywhere this good news is preached in the entire world, this good deed done by this woman will be spoken of in memory of her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He asked them: »What are you willing to give me to deliver him to you?« They paid him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He continued to seek opportunity to turn him over to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus. They asked: »Where do you wish to eat the Passover?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus told them to go into the city and tell a certain man: »The Teachers time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The disciples did as Jesus told them, to get ready for the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When evening arrived, he sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>While they ate, he said: »One of you will betray me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They were filled with sorrow, and each one asked him: »Is it I, Lord?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He answered: »He who dips his hand with me in the dish is the same one who will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»It is written that the Son of man will depart. The man who betrays him will experience much grief. It would have been better if that man had not been born.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Judas, the man who betrayed him, asked: »Is it I, Rabbi?« Jesus replied: »You said it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed, and broke it; and he gave to the disciples. Then he said: »Take, eat; this is representsmeansexemplifies my body.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took a cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: »Drink it all.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»This is representsmeansexemplifies my blood of the covenant, poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»I tell you, I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>After they sang a song of praise to God, they went to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus said to them: »All of you will fall away because of me tonight. It is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»When I am raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter answered: »Even if everyone falls away because of you, I will never fall away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said: »I say to you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter protested: »Even if I must die for you, I would not deny you!« His disciples said the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus went with them to Gethsemane. He said to his disciples: »Sit here while I go over there and pray.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. He was sorrowful and very troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He told them: »My heart is deeply grieved to the point of death. Stay with me and watch.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed: »My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he came to the disciples, they were sleeping. He said to Peter: »Could you not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Watch and pray continually that you do not enter into temptation!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>A second time he went away and prayed, saying: »Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, your will be done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He returned to find them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He went away to pray a third time, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>After returning to the disciples, he said: »Do you sleep now and take your rest? The hour is here and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Arise, let us go; the man who betrays me is here.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>As he spoke, Judas, one of the twelve, followed by a crowd carrying swords and spears, approached him. The chief priest and elders of the people had sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that betrayed him gave them a sign. He told them: »The one I kiss is he. Take him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He went directly to Jesus and said: »Hail, Rabbi,« and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus told him: »Do that for which you came.« They laid hands on Jesus, and captured him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Look, one of them with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus told him: »Put your sword in its place. Those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>»Do you think I cannot ask my Father for help? He would send me more than twelve legions of angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>»How then will the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>That very hour Jesus said to the people, »Have you come out to take me with swords and sticks as if I were a thief? You did not take me when I taught in the Temple daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>»This has taken place so that the writings of the prophets will come true.« Then all his disciples left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Those who captured Jesus took him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and those in authority also gathered there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter kept his distance. He followed him to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the servants, to see the outcome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus. They wanted to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>They failed, even though a number of false witnesses came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Later two witnesses came. They said: »This man said, I am able to destroy the Temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>The high priest stood up and said to him: »Have you no answer? What is it these say against you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Jesus said nothing. The high priest said to him: »I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him: »You said it yourself. And I say to you, after this you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest ripped his robes apart and said: »He has said evil against God! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard his words of blasphemy!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>»What is your opinion?« The crowd answered: »Put him to death!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>They spat in his face and hit him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>»Prophesy to us, you Christ; tell us who hit you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Peter was seated in the square outside the house, and a servant-girl came to him. She said: »You were with Jesus the Galilean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>In front of everybody, he replied: »I do not know what you are talking about.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>When he reached the gate, another saw him and said: »This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Again he denied with an oath: »I have no knowledge of the man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>A few moments later, those who were near approached and said to Peter: »Indeed, you are one of them, because the way you speak gives you away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then with curses and oaths he said: »I do not know the man!« And immediately a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>Peter remembered what Jesus told him: »Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.« He went out and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
