Come; see the place where the Lord lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead. See, he goes before you to Galilee. You will see him there, as I have told you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They departed quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy. They ran to bring his disciples the news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus met them and greeted them. They approached and took hold of his feet and kissed them in adoration.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus told them: »Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to travel to Galilee. I will see them there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While they were going, some of the guard came into the city. They told the chief priests all the things that happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They took counsel with the elders. Then they bribed the soldiers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The soldiers were instructed to say: »His disciples came at night and stole him while we slept.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»If the governor hears about this, we will persuade him so you may be free from worry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus specified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw him, they bowed down in adoration for him. But some doubted were lacking faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying: »All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Teach them to observe all the things I have commanded you.
