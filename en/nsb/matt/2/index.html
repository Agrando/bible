Astrologers arrived in Jerusalem from the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They asked: »Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and came to offer him praise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>King Herod was troubled when he heard this. Jerusalem was also troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law and asked where will the Messiah be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Bethlehem in Judea,« they answered. This is what the prophet wrote:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Bethlehem in the land of Judah, you are not the least of the leading cities of Judah. A leader will come out of you. He will shepherd my people Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod secretly called the astrologers to find out exactly the time the star appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He sent them to Bethlehem. He said: »Search diligently for the young child. When you find him, bring me word so I may come and bow down to him also.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After they heard the king, they followed the star until it stopped over the place where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They were overwhelmed with joy to see the star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They entered the house and saw the young child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and paid him homage. Then they opened their treasure chests and offered gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>God warned the astrologers in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they departed for their country by a different road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they left, the angel of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: »Herod is looking to kill the young child. Arise, take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to leave.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Joseph took the child and his mother to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They did not return until the death of Herod. The words spoken by Jehovah through the prophet were fulfilled: »I called my son out of Egypt.« (Hosea 11:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Herod saw that the astrologers tricked him and he was furious. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys two years old and younger in or near Bethlehem. This matched the time he learned from the astrologers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jeremiahs prophecy came true:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»A sound was heard in Ramah, the sound of crying in bitter grief. Rachel is weeping for her children. She would not be comforted, because they were dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After Herod died Gods angel appeared in a dream to Joseph who was in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The angel told him: »Take the child and his mother and go to Israel. Those who tried to kill the child are dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Joseph took the child and his mother to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he heard that Archelaus succeeded his father, Herod, as king of Judea, Joseph feared going. Warned in a dream, he left for Galilee instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He made his home in Nazareth. Thus the prophecy came true: »He Jesus will be called a Nazarene.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
