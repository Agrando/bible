Be made clean.« Right away his leprosy was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus told him not to tell anyone. »Show yourself to the priests and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When he entered Capernaum, a centurion captain of one hundred men approached him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said: »Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home and terribly tormented.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him: »I will come and heal him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The centurion replied to Jesus: »Lord, I am not worthy that you come under my roof. Say the word and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I also am a man having authority and commanding soldiers. I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard it, he was amazed, and said to the crowd: »I tell you, I have not found such great faith in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»but the sons of the kingdom will be cast forth into the outer darkness: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus said to the centurion: »Go. Just as you believe, so it will be done to you.« The servant was healed in that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus went to Peters house. He saw his wifes mother lying sick of a fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He touched her hand and the fever left her. She arose, and ministered to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That evening, they brought many people possessed with demons to him. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In so doing, that which was spoken through Isaiah was fulfilled. Isaiah wrote: »He took our sicknesses and removed our diseases.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Jesus saw how large the crowd was growing, he gave orders to depart to the other side of the lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A scribe came to him and said: »Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus replied: »Foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>One of his disciples said: »Lord, first allow me to go bury my father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him: »Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he entered a boat, his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Suddenly a storm blew in and the boat was covered with waves. Jesus was asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they came to him, woke him, and cried: »Save us, Lord, or we will perish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to them: »Why are you afraid, you of little faith?« Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea. Suddenly there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The disciples were in awe. They asked: »What kind of man is this, for even the winds and the sea obey him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he arrived at the other side of the lake in the country of the Gadarenes two men possessed by demons came to him from out of the tombs. They were extremely violent, so no man could pass by that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They screamed at him, saying: »What have we to do with you, Son of God? Have you come to torment us before the time?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>A large herd of swine was feeding in the distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The demons pleaded with him: »If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He told them to go. And they came out, and went into the swine. The entire herd rushed down the hill into the sea, where they perished in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The herdsmen fled to the city to tell everything that happened to the swine that were possessed with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Everyone in the city came out to meet Jesus. They begged him to go away from their country.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
