That explains the power working in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Herod locked John in prison to please Herodias, his brother Philips wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For John had said to him: »It is not lawful for you to have her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Herod wanted to put him to death but he feared the people since they believed John was a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It was Herods birthday. The daughter of Herodias danced for him and pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he promised with an oath to give her anything she wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Prompted by her mother, she said: »Give me John the Baptists head on a platter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The king was grieved. He gave his oath and many were watching so he commanded that it be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He gave the order to behead John in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head was brought on a platter to the young lady. She in turn gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>John the Baptists disciples took the corpse and buried him, and then came and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus heard it, he left in a boat to a secluded place. The crowds heard this and followed him on foot from the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He saw the great crowd, had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Evening came and the disciples approached Jesus and said: »This place is desolate. Send the people away so they may go to the villages and buy themselves food.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus told them: »They have no need to go away: you feed them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They remarked: »We have only five loaves, and two fishes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Bring them to me,« Jesus replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He commanded the crowd to sit down on the grass. Then he prayed. He gave the five loaves and two fishes to the disciples to distribute to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all had plenty to eat. In fact they had twelve baskets full of food left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>About five thousand men, plus women and children ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus sent the disciples in a boat to the other side of the sea. He stayed there until he sent the crowd away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After sending the crowd away, he went to the mountain to pray by himself. He was there alone that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea. The wind and the waves caused great trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Just before morning, Jesus walked to them on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When they saw him walking on the water they were troubled. »It is a spirit apparitionillusion!« they screamed! They cried out with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>At once Jesus said: »It is I; do not be afraid.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter said to him: »Lord, if it is you, give me the order to come to you on the water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said: »Come.« Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When he noticed how strong the wind was, he became afraid. He began to sink, and cried: »Help me Lord!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Suddenly, Jesus put out his hand and took hold of him, and said: »You of little faith, why were you in doubt?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wind went down when they got into the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Those on the boat loved him intensely, saying: »Truly, you are the Son of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They came to land at Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When the men of that place heard the news about Jesus they told everyone in the country. The sick were taken to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They wanted to touch his robe to be made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
