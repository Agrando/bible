When he was seated his disciples came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He opened his mouth and taught them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Blessed Greek: makarios: happy, blessed are those conscious of their spiritual need, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Blessed are the meek gentlemildhumble, for they will inherit the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Blessed are the merciful and compassionate, for they will receive mercy and compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Blessed are you when men revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Rejoice, and be filled with joy, for great is your reward in heaven. The prophets, who came before you, were also persecuted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»You are the salt of the earth. If its taste goes away, how will you restore it? It is good for nothing. All you can do is throw it on the ground and walk on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill may be seen by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»A light is not placed under a cover. To the contrary, it is placed on a table so all may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Likewise, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill perfectexecuteaccomplish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I solemnly tell you, heaven and earth would pass away before one small letter detail will pass away from the Law. All things must be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Whoever disobeys even the least of the commandments and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. On the other hand whoever obeys and teaches others to obey the Law will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I also tell you, your righteousness must be greater than the scribes and Pharisees or you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»You were told in the past, do not murder kill. Any one who murders will be brought to trial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Now I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be guilty before the court. Whoever speaks to his brother with words of contempt shall receive condemnation before the Sanhedrin Supreme Court. Curse your brother and you will be guilty enough to be destroyed by fire, with the burning trash, at the Valley of Hinnom, outside of Jerusalem Greek: Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»When making an offering at the altar and you remember your brother has something against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»leave your gift at the altar and go make peace with your brother. Then return and make your offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Come to an agreement quickly with the one who has a legal case against you. Do it before he turns the case over to the judge and you are thrown into jail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Take it from me; you will stay in jail until you pay the very last penny of your fine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You have heard it was said, You should not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»However, I tell you that whoever looks at a woman with lustful thoughts commits adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away! It is better to lose a part of your body then to have your whole body destroyed in the ever-burning fires of the Valley of Hinnom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose part of your body, than for your whole body to be destroyed in the ever-burning fire. Figuratively: lose prospect for everlasting life; ever-burning fire means total destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Again, it was said, Whoever gets rid of his wife has to give her a certificate of divorce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except for the reason of fornication, makes her liable to commit adultery. And if she marries again, the man she marries also commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»You were also told that you should keep a promise oath. Always keep your promises vows to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I tell you, offer no promises at all, not by heaven, because it is Gods throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Not by earth, for it is the footstool under His feet. Not by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»And do not promise by your head, for you cannot even control the hair on your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Let your answer be Yes or No. Anything more than this is from the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»You have heard it said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»But I tell you, do not resist a wicked person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to that person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»If someone takes you to court to sue you and takes your shirt, let him have your coat as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Whoever makes you go one mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»Give to those who ask. Lend to those who borrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»You have heard it said, You should love your neighbor and hate your enemy. (Leviticus 19:18)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»I say love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»You will then act as true children of your Father in heaven. He gives sunlight to both evil and good people. He sends rain for the just and the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»What good is there, when you love only those who love you? Even corrupt tax collectors do that!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»When you are kind only to your friends and brothers what makes you different from anyone else? Even people of the nations do that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»Be perfect mature, even as your Father in heaven is perfect mature.
