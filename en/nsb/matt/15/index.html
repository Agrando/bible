They eat food with unwashed hands.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His answer to them was in the form of a question: »Why do you go against the word of God in favor of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»God said, Honor your father and mother. He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»You teach that a man should tell his father or mother that what he has that could help them, is given to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You say there is no need for him to give honor to his father. You have invalidated the word of God because of your tradition!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You hypocrites liars! Isaiahs prophecy was right about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»These people honor me with their lips, but their heart innermost thoughts is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules commands of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He got the people together and said to them: »Listen, and let my words be clear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»That which comes out of the mouth makes a man unclean, not that which goes into the mouth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The disciples told him the Pharisees were upset by what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In answer he replied: »Every plant my Father in heaven has not planted in the earth will be pulled out by the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Let them be. They are blind guides. If a blind man guides another blind man, they will fall in a hole together.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Peter said to him: »Make the story clear to us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He replied: »Are you, like them, without wisdom?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Do you not see, that which goes into the mouth, goes into the stomach and is sent out as waste?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»That which comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart and makes a man unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Evil thoughts come from the heart! Thoughts about murder, adultery, fornication, theft, lying, and slander come from the heart!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»These things make a man unclean. Eating food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A woman of Canaan came crying and saying: »Have pity on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He did not answer her. His disciples said to him: »Send her away; she keeps shouting at us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He answered: »I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She bowed down before him and asked for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said: »It is not right to take the childrens bread and give it to the dogs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said: »Yes, Lord; but even the dogs take the scraps from under their masters table.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»O woman,« Jesus replied, »your faith is great! Let your desire be done.« And her daughter was made well from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus went from there to the Sea of Galilee. He went up into the mountain and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Many people came to him. They brought those who were lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many other people. They laid them down at his feet and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The people marveled as they saw the mute speak, the crippled and lame walk, and the blind see. They glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus called his disciples and said: »I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples replied: »Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus asked: »How many loaves do you have?« They said: »Seven, and a few small fish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He told the people to sit down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He took the seven loaves and the fish and offered a prayer of thanksgiving. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. The disciples gave them to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They all ate and were satisfied. When they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, there were seven large baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Four thousand men, besides women and children were fed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>After dismissing the crowds, Jesus took a boat to the region of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
