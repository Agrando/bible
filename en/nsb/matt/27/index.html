The chief priests and those in authority conspired to put Jesus to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They tied his hands with cords and led him to the ruler, Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Judas, his betrayer, heard he was to be put to death. Out of regret, he took the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and those in authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He said: »I have done wrong in giving a righteous man to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He left the silver in the Temple. Then he went away and hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The chief priests took the silver. They said: »It is not right to put it in the Temple treasury, for it is the price of blood.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They decided to use the silver to buy the potters field. This would be a place to bury strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This is the reason the field was named »Field of Blood.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jeremiahs prophecy was fulfilled: »They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price he was valued by the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Then they paid for the potters field, just as God directed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus stood before the governor. He asked him: »Are you the King of the Jews?« Jesus said to him: »It is as you say.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate said to him: »Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus did not answer. Not even a word! The governor was greatly surprised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It was a custom for the governor to set one prisoner free at the time of the feast. The people were to help choose that prisoner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time they held an important prisoner named Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they assembled, Pilate asked: »What is your choice? Barabbas or Jesus, the one called the Christ?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He knew it was because of envy they gave him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While he was seated in judgment his wife sent a message to him. She said, »Do not judge that righteous man. I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The chief priests and elders got the people to request Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The governor responded to them. He asked: »Which of the two do you want me to set free?« They shouted: »Barabbas!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate said to them: »What am I to do with Jesus, the one called Christ?« They all said: »Put him to death. Impale him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»What evil has he done?« Pilate asked. But they shouted: »Impale him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pilate saw that he could do nothing. The people were ready to cause much trouble. He took water and washed his hands in front of the people. He said: »The blood of this man is not on my hands. You are responsible.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The people answered: »Let his blood be on us, and on our children.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He set Barabbas free. He had Jesus whipped. Then he commanded that he be put to death on the stake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the palace guard took Jesus into the open square and gathered their squad together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They took off his clothes and dressed him in a scarlet robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They placed a rod in his right hand. Then they bowed down on their knees before him. They mocked him, saying: »Long life to the King of the Jews.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They spat on him and hit him on the head with the rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>After they mocked him, they took off the robe. He was dressed in his garments and he was led away to be impaled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They then found Simon, a man from Cyrene. They forced him to go with them to carry the stake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Golgotha, the Place of the Skull, was to be his final destination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They gave him vinegar bitter wine to drink mixed with poison a druggall. When he tasted it he would not drink. (Psalm 69:21)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When they impaled him, they divided his garments among themselves by casting lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then they sat and watched him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A sign was placed above his head with an accusation written: »This is Jesus the King of the Jews.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Two robbers were impaled with him. One was on the right hand and one on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>People passing by spoke evil abuse to him. They wagged their heads</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and said, »You who would destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God come down from the stake.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In like manner the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They said: »He saved others, but cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the stake and we will believe in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusts in God. Let him save him now if he wants him. After all he said: »I am the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The robbers that were impaled with him also insulted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, »Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?« Which translated means: »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>After hearing it some said this man calls Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Suddenly, one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The rest said: »Let it be, and see whether Elijah comes to save him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>The veil curtain of the temple was ripped in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks split.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The tombs were split open and many dead bodies were tossed upright on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They came out of the tombs after his resurrection.Manuscript text unclear. Many people saw them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake. Filled with much fear of the things that were done, they proclaimed: »Truly, this was the Son of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The women who followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to him watched from a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Included among the women were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>A disciple of Jesus named Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate commanded that it be given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>He laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone in front of the door of the tomb, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Mary Magdalene was near the tomb. The other Mary was also there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>It was morning, the day after Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together with Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>They said: »Sir, we remember while he was yet alive, the deceiver said, After three days I will rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>»Command the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise his disciples could come and steal him away. They could say to the people. He is risen from the dead. The last deception will be worse than the first.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate said to them: »You have a guard; make it as secure as you can.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So they made the tomb secure. They sealed the stone and placed a guard there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
