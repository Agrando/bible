Then he sent them into his vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»He went out the third hour and saw others in the marketplace doing nothing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»He said to them: Go to the vineyard with the others. I will pay you whatever is right. So they went to work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He went out the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The eleventh hour, he saw others doing nothing. He asked: Why are you here all the day doing nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»They said: No man has given us work. He told them to go work with the rest in the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»When evening came, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager: Let the workers come and pay them from the last to the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Those men who went to work at the eleventh hour were each given a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Those who worked longer, expected to be paid more. They were also given a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»When they got it, they protested against the master of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»They said: The last ones have done only one hours work. You have made them equal to us. We have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»He told them: I do you no wrong. You made an agreement with me for a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Take what is yours and leave. I wish to give to the last workers the same as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Is it lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Or is your eye jealous because I am generous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»So the last will be first, and the first last.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus went to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and talked to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»When we get to Jerusalem,« he said, »The Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes. They will give orders for him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»They will turn him over to the heathen to be made sport of and to be whipped. He will be put to death on the stake. The third day he will come back from the dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons. She bowed down and requested a favor of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»What is your desire?« he asked. She said to him: »Let my two sons be seated, the one at your right hand, and the other at your left, in your kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus told her: »You have no idea what you are requesting. Are you able to take of the cup I am about to take? »</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They said: »We are able.« »Truly, you will take of my cup,« he said. »But to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give. It is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the ten heard it, they were angry with the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus called them to himself and said: »You know that the rulers of the nations exercise absolute dominion over them. They lord it over them and behave like tyrants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»But it will not be so among you. He who will be great among you must be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he who will be first among you will be your attendant servantminister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»The Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom in payment for many.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A great crowd followed him when they departed from Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Two blind men sitting by the side of the road heard Jesus pass by and cried out: »Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The crowd told them to be quiet. But they cried even more, saying: »Have mercy on us, O Lord, you Son of David!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus stood still and asked them: »What do you want me to do to you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said: »Lord give us our sight.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Now they could see! So they followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
