His face was as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Moses and Elijah appeared, and they were talking to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Peter told Jesus: »Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let us make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud, saying: »This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces. They were very afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus touched them and told them to get up and not be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They saw only Jesus when they opened their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone what they saw, until the Son of man has risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples asked him: »Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In answer he said: »Elijah truly has to come and put all things right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I tell you that Elijah has come. They did not know him and treated him badly as they pleased. They will do the same with the Son of man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples saw that he was telling them about John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When they approached the people, a man fell to his knees before him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Lord, have mercy on my son. He has mental problems and is in great pain. He frequently falls into the fire and into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I took him to your disciples, and they were not able to make him well.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answered: »You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus ordered the unclean spirit to leave the boy. It left him and the boy was made well immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said: »Why were we not able to send it out?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He told them: »It was because of your lack of faith: Truly I say to you, if you have faith as small as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move and it will move. Nothing will be impossible to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>omitted, text not found in early manuscripts</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they were traveling in Galilee, Jesus said to them: »The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»They will put him to death. The third day he will be raised from death.« They were very sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They arrived at Capernaum. The collectors of the two-drachma tax asked Peter: »Does your master make payment of the Temple tax?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said: »Yes.« When he entered the house, Jesus said to him: »What is your opinion, Simon? Who pays the tax assessed by the kings of the earth? Is it from their sons or from other people?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When he said: »From other people,« Jesus replied: »Are the sons free of tax?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»We will not cause them trouble. Go to the sea, and let down a hook, and take the first fish you catch. You will see money a stater coin in its mouth. Give it to them for me and for you.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
