Seeing their faith Jesus said to the sick man: »Have courage; your sins are forgiven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Some of the scribes said among themselves: »This man has no respect for God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said: »Why are your thoughts evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Which is easier, to say, your sins are forgiven, or to say, get up and walk?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So that you know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he turned and spoke to the paralytic or paralyzed man: »Get up, take your bed and go to your house.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He arose, and departed to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But when the people saw it, they marveled, and glorified God who had given such authority to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus moved on. He then saw Matthew seated at his work collecting taxes. He said to him: »Follow me.« He rose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus was a dinner guest at Matthews house. Many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the Pharisees saw it, they asked his disciples: »Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he heard it, he said: »People who are well do not have need of a physician. The sick do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»You should learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; for I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The disciples of John asked: »Why do your disciples not fast?« They frequently fasted, and so did the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus replied: »Should the wedding guests mourn and also celebrate with the groom? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Why patch an old garment with cloth that has not been shrunk? The patch shrinks and pulls away from the old cloth leaving a big hole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Neither do men put new wine in old wineskins. The skins burst and the wine is lost. They put new wine in fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was speaking, an official came and paid him respect. He said: »By now my daughter must be dead. Come and lay your hand on her and she will live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A woman who had a hemorrhage chronic flow of blood for twelve years came behind him. She touched the border of his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>She said to herself: »If I touch his garment, I will be healed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus turned to see her and said: »Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well.« The woman was healed at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus went into the officials house and saw flute players and the crowd making a lot of noise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He told them to leave: »For the girl is not dead, but sleeps.« They all scornfully laughed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The people were sent away. He went to the girl, took hold of her hand, and she got up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The news about this spread to all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus left that place and walked along the road. Two blind men followed him. They shouted: »Have mercy on us, Son of David!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He went into a nearby house. The blind men followed him. Jesus asked them: »Do you believe that I can heal you?« They said: »Yes Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He touched their eyes. »Let it be done,« he said, »according to your faith.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly warned them: »Do not let anyone know about this.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They spread the news about Jesus all over that part of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Next, a dumb man possessed with a demon was brought to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke. The crowd marveled, saying: »We have never seen anything like this in Israel!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Pharisees complained: »He casts out demons with the help of the ruler of the demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus went to all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the kingdom. He healed every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When he saw the large crowds of people, he was moved with compassion for them. He knew they were distressed and scattered like sheep not having a shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to his disciples: »The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Pray that the Lord of the harvest will send out workers into his harvest.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
