He entered a boat while the crowd stood on the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He told them many illustrations. He said: »A farmer went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds devoured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Others fell on rocky places and did not have much soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»When they grew, the sun scorched them, and because they had no root they withered and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Others fell upon the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Some fell on good ground and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»He that has ears let him hear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples asked him: »Why do you speak in illustrations?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He responded: »You are allowed to know the divine secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but it is not for others to know. The Greek word for »you« is plural and is applied to the disciples as a group.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»He who has shall receive more to the point of abundance. He who does not have, it shall be taken away including that which he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I speak to them in illustrations storiesparablesallegories, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear. They just do not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»The prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled. By hearing, you shall hear, and shall in no way understand. By seeing you shall see, and shall in no way perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The heart of this people is callous and dull. Their ears are plugged. They cannot hear. They closed their eyes and cannot see. They cannot see nor hear nor understand with their heart. They should turn around and I would heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Happy and blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Truly, I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see, and could not see them. They also desired to hear the things that you hear, and could not hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Listen to the illustration of the sower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one takes away that which was sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Anyone sown among the rocky places hears the word and immediately with joy receives it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»There is no root in him. He endures for a while. When he has tribulation or persecution because of the word, he falls away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»He that was sown among thorns hears the word. The cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»He that was sown upon the good ground hears the word, and understands it. He bears fruit, producing sometimes a hundredfold, sometimes sixty, and sometimes thirty.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He told another illustration, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a man that sowed good seed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»While he slept, his enemy came and sowed weeds with the wheat, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»When the blade sprouted and brought forth fruit, it looked like wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The servants of the householder said to him: Sir, did you sow good seed in your field? Why does it have weeds mixed in with the good wheat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»He replied: An enemy did this. The servants offered to remove the weeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»He said: No, you might uproot the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Let both grow together until the harvest. In the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: »Gather weeds first, and bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat into my barn.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In another illustration Jesus said: »The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man sowed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. Yet when it grows it becomes as large as a tree. In fact the birds of heaven lodge in the branches.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He offered another illustration: »The kingdom of heaven is similar to leaven. A woman hid leaven in three measures of meal until it was all leavened.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus spoke with illustrations to the crowds. He did not speak anything without using illustrations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That which was spoken through the prophet was fulfilled, saying: »I will open my mouth in illustrations. I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples gathered near him. They said: »Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said: »He that sows the good seed is the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»The field is the world the society of mankind. The good seed are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»The enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age. The reapers are angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»The weeds are gathered up and burned destroyed with fire. It will be this way at the end of the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»The Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all who stumble others and commit lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»The angels will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»The righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found the treasure and hid it again in the field. He is so filled with joy he sells everything he owns and buys the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»The kingdom of heaven is also like a merchant seeking valuable pearls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»When he found one pearl of great value, he sold all that he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea. It gathered fish of every kind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»They drew it up on the beach when it was full. They gathered the good into containers and threw away the bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»It will be that way at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»The wicked will be cast into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»Have you understood all these things?« They said to him: »Yes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said to them: »Every scribe journalistwriter who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a householder, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>After Jesus finished telling these illustrations, he left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He went to his own country and taught in the synagogue. They were astonished and asked where this man got this wisdom and these mighty works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>»Is this man the carpenters son? Is his mother called Mary? Are his brothers James and Joseph, Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>»Are his sisters all with us? Where did he get all these things?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>They resented him. But Jesus responded to them: »A prophet is without honor in his own country, and in his own house.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>He did not do many mighty works there because of their lack of faith.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
