He went to the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Large crowds followed him, and he healed many of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Pharisees came to him. They tested him, asking: »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He answered: »Have you not read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. The two shall become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What God has joined together, let no man pull apart separate!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They asked him: »Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, to send her away?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He answered: »Moses allowed you to send your wives away because of your hardness of heart. It was not allowed from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. And he who marries her when she is divorced, commits adultery.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples said to him: »This being the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said: »This does not apply to everyone, only to those God has given it to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»For there are men who, from birth, were without sex. There are some who were made that way by men. There are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this let him accept it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then some people brought little children to him. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and bless them. But the disciples tried to stop them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus said: »Let the little ones children come to me. Do not keep them away: for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He put his hands on them, and then went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>One man said: »Master, what good thing must I do, so that I may have eternal life?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answered him: »Why are you questioning me about what is good? There is one who is good. If you desire life, obey the Law.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The man replied: »Which law?« And Jesus said: »Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Honor your father and your mother, and Love your neighbor as yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The man said to him: »I have done all these things; what more is there?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus then replied: »If you wish to be complete, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor. You will have wealth in heaven. Then follow me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But hearing these words, the young man went away grieving, for he was very wealthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to his disciples: »Truly I tell you, it is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Again I say, It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The disciples were greatly surprised when they heard this. »Who, then, may have salvation?« they asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus looked at them and said: »With men this is not possible. All things are possible with God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter said: »See, we have given up everything to follow you. What then will we have?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus replied: »Truly I say to you, when all things are made new, and the Son of man is seated in his glory, you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Everyone who has given up houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or child, or land, for my name, will receive many times as much, and have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Many who are first will be last. Some who are last will be first.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
