Come meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The virgins awoke and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»All the foolish virgins said to the wise: Give us your oil, for our lamps are going out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»But the wise answered: There will not be enough for both of us. Go to the dealers and buy oil for yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»While they were away, the bridegroom came. They that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Later the other virgins came, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»But he told them: I do not know you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»It is like a man going to another country. He called his servants and put them in charge of his property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one. He assigned according to the servants ability. Then he went on his journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Right away the servant who received the five talents traded with them and made another five talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»In like manner, he who received the two gained another two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»He who received the one dug a hole in the ground and hid his lords money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»After a long time the lord of those servants came back to settle with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»The servant who received five talents brought another five talents. He said: Lord, here are your five talents, plus the five I gained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»His lord said: Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, so I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The one who received two talents said: Lord you gave me two talents and I gained another two talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»His lord said: Well done, good and faithful servant. You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»The servant who received one talent said: Lord, I knew you to be a hard man. You reap where you did not sow and gather where you did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I was afraid, so I hid your talent in the earth. See, you have what is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»But his lord answered: You wicked and lazy servant. You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You should have put my money in the bank. I should have received my money back plus interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»More will be given to every one who has and he will have abundance.

I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you took me in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»The righteous will answer him: Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or naked and dress you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»The King will answer: To the extent that you did it to one of the least of my brothers, you did it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Then he will tell those on his left: Depart from me, you cursed, into the ever-burning fire that is prepared for the Devil and his fallen angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»I was a stranger and you did not take me in. I was naked and you did not dress me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»They will also ask: Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison and not minister to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»The King will answer: To the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of my brothers, you did not do it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»These will go away into ever-burning fire everlasting cutting offdeathtotal destructiondoompunishmenteverlasting penalty, but the righteous to everlasting life.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
