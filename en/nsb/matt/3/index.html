Make his paths straight.« (Isaiah 40:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John wore clothes made from camels hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>People from Jerusalem, Judea, and the whole Jordan Valley went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They confessed their sins and were baptized by John in the Jordan River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism. »You offspring of vipers,« he said, »who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Bear fruit worthy of repentance!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Do not presume that Abraham is your father.

He will then burn the husks in a fire that cannot be put out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I need to be baptized by you,« John said. »Why are you coming to me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus answered emphatically: »This is the proper way to do everything that God requires. This is the way it must be!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Jesus was baptized and came up from the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened. He saw Gods Spirit coming down like a dove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then a voice from heaven said: »This is my Son whom I love and whom I have approved.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
