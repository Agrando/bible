It was Sabbath day and yet Jesus and his disciples went through the grain fields plucking ears and eating them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Pharisees saw it and said to him: »Your disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He replied to them: »Have you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»He entered into the house of God, and he and his companions ate the showbread holy bread, which it was not lawful for them to eat. It was only lawful for the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Have you read the law that on the Sabbath day the priests in the Temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I say to you, one greater than the Temple is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»If you had known what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He left and went into their synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There he saw a man who had a withered hand. They asked him if it is lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? They wanted to accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to them: »Which of you having one sheep, if this sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not get it and lift it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»How much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he said to the man: »Stretch out your hand.« He stretched it out and it was restored whole like the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Pharisees left and took counsel against him, to decide how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus was aware of this and withdrew from the place. Many followed him and were healed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He warned them not to tell anyone where he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Look! My servant whom I have chosen. I am well pleased with him. I will put my Spirit upon him and he will declare judgment to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»He will not quarrel, nor cry aloud. None will hear his voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»He will break a bruised reed. He will quench smoking flax. This he will do until he sends forth judgment to victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»The nations will hope in his name!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Someone possessed with a demon, blind and dumb was brought to him. He healed him and the dumb man spoke and could see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The crowds were amazed, and said: »Can this be the son of David?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the Pharisees heard it, they said: »This man casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of the demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: »Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed. Every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How will his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»If I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Let them be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»But if I cast out demons by Gods Spirit, then the kingdom of God has come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»How can one enter into the house of a strong man and steal his things, except he first tie up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»He that is not with me is against me. And he that does not gather with me, scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men. But the blasphemy against Gods Spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt. The fruit a tree produces provides its reputation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»You offspring of vipers. How can you who are evil speak good things? Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»The good man performs good things out of his good treasure. The evil man performs evil things out of his evil treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»I tell you there will be an account in the Judgment Day for every careless word that men say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: »Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He answered them: »An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign. No sign will be given but the sign of Jonah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the huge fish, so the Son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it. After all, they repented at the preaching of Jonah. Yet someone greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it. She came from the ends of the earth to hear the Wisdom of Solomon. Someone greater than Solomon is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»When an unclean spirit goes out of a man it passes through the desert seeking rest. It does not find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»It tries to return to the place from where it came. It finds it empty, swept, and fixed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»Then it takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. It will also be like this with this evil generation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While Jesus was yet speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers stood nearby. They wanted to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Someone told Jesus: »Look, your mother and your brothers stand nearby seeking to speak to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he answered: »Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said: »Behold, my mother and my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»For everyone who does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
