You are able to see the face of heaven, but not the signs of the time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»An evil and false generation is searching after a sign. However, no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.« Then he left them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The disciples came from the other side of the sea. They did not think to obtain bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said: »Take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They reasoned among themselves, saying: »We took no bread.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hearing this, Jesus said: »You of little faith, why are you reasoning among yourselves about not having bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Do you still not see or remember the five cakes of bread of the five thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Why do you not understand I was not talking about bread? Instead, about keeping away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they realized it was not the leaven of bread he had in mind. It was the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus traveled to parts of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples: »Who do men say that the Son of man is?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They said: »John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Who do you say that I am?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon Peter answered: »You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answered him: »Bless you, Simon son of John. This knowledge came from my Father in heaven and not from man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»You are Peter Greek: petros: piece of rock, and on this rock-mass Greek: petra: mass of rockreferring to Jesus I will build my congregation. The entrance to the grave Greek: Hades will not have power to stop it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is improper and unlawful in heaven, and whatever you declare lawful on earth must be lawful in heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He gave orders to the disciples to tell no man he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time forward Jesus made it clear to his disciples how he would have to go to Jerusalem. He told them he would undergo much at the hands of the authorities, including the chief priests and scribes. He let them know he would be put to death. The third day he would come back from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Peter protested and rebuked Jesus. He said: »Do not think of that, Lord; it will never happen to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He turned to Peter and said: »Get behind me, Satan. You are a stumbling block to me. You think the things of men, not of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus told his disciples: »If any man wants to follow me be mine, let him deny disown himself, and take up his stake and follow me Greek: akoloutheo moi, let him be following meaccompany mebe in the same way with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»He who wants to save his life will lose it. He who is willing to lose his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»What will a man profit, if he gains the whole world, and gives up his life? What will a man give in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels. He will then reward each man according to his deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»I tell you truly, there are some that stand here who will not experience death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
