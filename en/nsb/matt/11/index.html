He sent his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They asked Jesus: »Are you the Expected One or should we look for another?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered: »Go tell John the things you hear and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The blind receive their sight. The lame walk! The lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear. The dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Blessed and happy is he who is not offended by me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When these men left, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John. »What did you go into the wilderness to find? Did you look for a reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»What did you expect to see, a man clothed in fancy clothes? Those who wear fancy clothes are in kings houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Did you go to see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»This is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare the way for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I tell you, there is none, born of women, greater then John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been mans goal, and men of violence have attempted to take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»He who has ears to hear let him listen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Of what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their playmates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»They say: We piped for you and you did not dance. We cried and you did not mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, A gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! Wisdom is justified by its actions.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he denounced the cities where most of his mighty works were done, because they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon that were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Will you, Capernaum, be exalted into heaven? You will go down into the grave. If the mighty works had been done in Sodom, which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment, than for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jesus prayed: »I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and have revealed them to children. (Acts 2:36)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Yes, Father, for it was very pleasing in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»All things have been delivered to me from my Father. Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father. The Son tells others about the Father so that they can know him too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Come unto me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me. I am meek mild and humble in heart. You will have a restful life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>» for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
