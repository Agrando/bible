There he was tested tempted by the Devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He fasted forty days and nights, and was very hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Satan, the Tempter, said to him: »If since you are the Son of God order these stones to turn into bread.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In reply Jesus answered: »It is written; man shall not live on bread alone, but on all everythingevery wordevery utteranceevery declaration that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah.« (Deuteronomy 8:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the Devil took him into the holy city and had him stand on top of the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»If since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. The Scriptures say: God will give orders to his angels about you and they will hold you with their hands, so that not even your feet will strike the ground.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Again it is written,« Jesus replied, »you must not put Jehovah your God to the test.« (Deuteronomy 6:16)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This time the Devil took Jesus to an extremely high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world with all their greatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I will give all this to you,« the Devil told Jesus, »if you kneel down and worship me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Go away, Satan!« demanded Jesus. »It is written, »It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.« (Deuteronomy 6:13-15)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Devil left Jesus, and the angels came and served him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus heard that John had been arrested. So Jesus withdrew to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He left Nazareth to reside at Capernaum, a town by Lake Galilee, in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus the prophecy revealed to Isaiah would be fulfilled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»the people sitting in darkness saw a great light. Light rose upon those sitting in a region of deathly shadow.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From that time on Jesus preached this message: »Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is near.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus walked on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother. They were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said to them: »Follow me and I will teach you to catch people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At once they abandoned their nets and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother. They were in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Instantly they left the boat and their father, and went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus walked all over Galilee teaching in the synagogues. He preached the Good News about the Kingdom. He also healed every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>News about him spread throughout the country of Syria. People sick and suffering from diseases, people with demons, epileptics and paralytics, came to him. Jesus healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because of this, large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the land on the other side of the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
