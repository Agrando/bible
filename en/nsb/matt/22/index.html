Oxen and fat livestock are butchered and everything is ready, so come to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»But they paid no attention and went about their business. One went to his farm and another went to his trade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The rest violently attacked his servants and put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The king was angry, and sent his armies to put the evil servants to death and to destroy their town with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He said to his servants, The feast is ready, but the guests were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Go then, to the main roads, and invite all those whom you see to come to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»They went to the roads and brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike. And the banquet room was filled with guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»When the king met the guests he found that one of them was not wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The king asked why did he not wear proper clothes for the wedding? But the guest had no excuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The king gave orders for that person to be tied hand and foot and thrown outside into the dark. That is where people will cry and grind their teeth in pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Many are called, but few chosen.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Pharisees took counsel how they might trap him in his talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They sent their disciples with the Herodians to Jesus. They said: »Teacher we know you are truthful. You teach the way of God in truth. And you are not partial to the influence of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Tell us what you think? Is it lawful to pay the poll tax to Caesar, or not?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus perceived their wickedness. He said: »Why do you test me, you hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Show me the tribute money.« They brought a penny denarius to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He asked: »Whose image and superscription is on this coin?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Caesars,« they said. Then he said: »Pay Caesar the things that are Caesars. Pay God the things that are Gods.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they heard it, they were amazed and left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That same day, Sadducees came to him. They believe there is no resurrection. They asked him a question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Teacher, Moses said if a man dies having no children, his brother should marry his wife, and bring up seed for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»There were seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no children, left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The same happened to the second, right on through the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»After that the woman died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»In the resurrection, with which of the seven will she be married? All seven had her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered: »You are mistaken! You do not know the scriptures or the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»In the resurrection they will not marry nor be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you read that which was spoken to you by God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»God said: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When many people heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Pharisees assembled together when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>One of them, a lawyer, tested him by asking a question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Teacher what is the greatest commandment in the law?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus told him: »You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart Greek: kardia: feelings, emotions, and with all your being, and with your entire mind Greek: dianoia: understanding. (Deuteronomy 6:5)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»This is the greatest and first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»The second like it is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»The law and the prophets are based on these two commandments.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Pharisees were gathered together, so Jesus asked them a question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?« They said: »The son of David.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said: »How then does David, directed by Spirit, call him Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Jehovah said to my Lord, »Sit on my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet.«  (Psalm 110:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»If David called him Lord, how is he his son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>No one was able to answer him. After that they asked no more questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
