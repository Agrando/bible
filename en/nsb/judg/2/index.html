You will throw down their altars. You have not obeyed my voice. Why have you done this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I also said: I will not drive them out from before you. They will be thorns in your sides. Their gods will snare trap you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel the people wept loudly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They called that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Joshua let the people go the children of Israel went, every man, to his inheritance to possess the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works Jehovah did for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Joshua son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died at the age of a hundred and ten years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They buried him on the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of Gaash hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>After those generations were gathered to their fathers died another generation followed them. This new generation did not know Jehovah or the works he had done for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served Baalim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They forsook Jehovah God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them. They bowed to them and provoked Jehovah to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They forsook Jehovah and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel. He delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherever they went the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil. For Jehovah had sworn to them and as Jehovah had sworn they were greatly distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Nevertheless Jehovah established judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet they would not listen to their judges, but prostituted themselves to other gods. They worshiped them. They turned quickly, out of the way in which their fathers walked obeying the commandments of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When Jehovah established judges he supported each judge. He delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days the judge lived. He had compassion for them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When the judge was dead they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers. They followed other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel. He said: »Because this people have transgressed my covenant, which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I will not drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»That through them I may test Israel, to see whether they will keep the way of Jehovah and walk in it as their fathers did.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out. He did not deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
