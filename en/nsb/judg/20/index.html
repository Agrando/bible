They were united in Jehovahs presence at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The leaders of all the tribes of Israel were present at this gathering of Gods people. There were four hundred thousand foot soldiers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the people of Benjamin heard that all the other Israelites had gathered at Mizpah. The Israelites asked: »Tell us, how did this wicked deed happen?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The Levite whose concubine had been murdered answered: »My concubine and I went to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The men of Gibeah came to get me. They surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me. Instead they raped my concubine, and she died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I took her body and cut it in pieces. Then I sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel for these people have committed an evil and immoral act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»What are you Israelites going to do about this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The people stood together and said: »None of us, whether he lives in a tent or in a house, will go home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»This is what we will do: We will draw lots and choose some men to attack Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»One tenth of the men in Israel will provide food for the army. The others will go and punish Gibeah for this immoral act they committed in Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The men of Israel assembled with one purpose, to attack the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The tribes of Israel sent messengers through the territory of the tribe of Benjamin to say: »What is this crime that you have committed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Hand over those perverts in Gibeah, so that we can kill them and remove this evil from Israel.« But the people of Benjamin would not listen to their brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>People from all the cities of Benjamin came to Gibeah to fight the other people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They mobilized twenty-six thousand soldiers from their cities that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Besides these, the citizens of Gibeah gathered seven hundred specially chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a strand of hair and never miss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not including the tribe of Benjamin, the well-trained soldiers of Israel numbered four hundred thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Israelites went to the house of God at Bethel, and there they asked God: »Which of us should attack the Benjaminites first?« Jehovah answered: »The tribe of Judah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the Israelites started out the next morning and camped near the city of Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They went to attack the army of Benjamin, and placed the soldiers in battle array to fight against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The army of Benjamin came out of the city. That day they killed twenty-two thousand Israelite soldiers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Israelite army was encouraged as they placed the soldiers in position again at the place where they put themselves the first day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They mourned in the presence of Jehovah until evening. They asked him if they should go again in battle against their brothers the Benjaminites? Jehovahs answer was: »Yes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Israelites marched against the army of Benjamin a second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The second time the Benjaminites came out of Gibeah. This time they killed eighteen thousand trained Israelite soldiers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The people of Israel went up to Bethel and mourned. They sat there in Jehovahs presence and fasted until evening. They offered fellowship sacrifices and burned some sacrifices whole in the presence of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The Ark of the Covenant was there at Bethel in those days. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, was in charge of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The people asked Jehovah: »Should we go to battle against our brothers the Benjaminites again, or should we cease?« Jehovah answered: »Fight. Tomorrow I will give you victory over them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Israelites hid some soldiers around Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then for the third straight day they marched against the army of Benjamin. They placed their soldiers in battle position facing Gibeah, as they had done before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Benjaminites came out to fight and were drawn away from the city. Just as before they killed some Israelites in the open country, on the road to Bethel and on the road to Gibeah. They killed about thirty Israelites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Benjaminites said: »They are defeated just as before. But the Israelites planned to retreat and lead them away from the city onto the roads.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The main army of the Israelites pulled back and regrouped at Baaltamar. The men surrounding Gibeah suddenly rushed out of hiding in the rocky country around the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ten thousand, specially chosen men, out of all Israel, attacked Gibeah, and the fighting was fierce. The Benjaminites did not realize they were about to be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jehovah gave Israel victory over the army of Benjamin. The Israelites killed twenty five thousand one hundred of the enemy that day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Benjaminites knew they were defeated. The main body of the Israelite army had retreated from the Benjaminites. This is because they relied on the men that were hiding around Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>These men ran quickly toward Gibeah. They spread out and killed everyone there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The main Israelite army and the men in hiding had a prearranged signal. When they saw a big cloud of smoke going up from the town,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>the Israelites out on the battlefield were to turn around. By this time the Benjaminites had already killed the thirty Israelites. They told themselves: »We have beaten them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The signal appeared. A cloud of smoke rose above the town. The Benjaminites looked behind them to see the whole city going up in flames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then the Israelites turned around. The Benjaminites were thrown into panic because they could see that they were about to be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They retreated from the Israelites. They ran toward the open country and could not escape. They were caught between the main army and the men now coming out of the city. They were destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The Israelites trapped the enemy. Without stopping they pursued them as far as a point east of Gibeah. They killed them as they advanced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Eighteen thousand of the best Benjaminite soldiers were killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The others turned and ran to the open country to Rimmon Rock. Five thousand of them were killed on the roads. The Israelites continued to pursue the rest to Gidom, killing two thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In all, twenty-five thousand brave Benjaminites were killed that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Six hundred men were able to escape to the open country to Rimmon Rock. They stayed there four months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Israelites turned back against the rest of the Benjaminites and killed them all, men and women, children and animals as well. They burned every town in the area.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
