They made a solemn promise to Jehovah: »None of us will allow a daughter to marry a Benjaminite.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The people of Israel went to Bethel and sat there in the presence of God until evening. They lifted their voices and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They said: »Jehovah God of Israel, why has this happened? Why is the tribe of Benjamin about to disappear from Israel?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The next morning the people got up early and built an altar there. They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They asked: »Is there any group out of all the tribes of Israel that did not go to the gathering in Jehovahs presence at Mizpah?« They had taken a solemn oath that anyone who had not gone to Mizpah would be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The people of Israel felt sorry for their brothers the Benjaminites. They said: »Israel has lost one of its tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»We have made a solemn promise to Jehovah that we will not give them any of our daughters. How can we make sure that the remaining men of Benjamin will have wives?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they asked if some group out of the tribes of Israel had not gone to the gathering at Mizpah, they found out that no one from Jabesh in Gilead had been there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>No one from Jabesh responded to the roll call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The assembly sent twelve thousand of their bravest men with the orders: Go kill everyone in Jabesh, including women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Kill all the males, and also every woman who is not a virgin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They found four hundred young virgins among the people in Jabesh. They brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The whole assembly sent word to the Benjaminites who were at Rimmon Rock and offered to end the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Benjaminites came back. And the other Israelites gave them the young women from Jabesh whom they had not killed. But there were not enough of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The people felt sorry for the Benjaminites because Jehovah had broken the unity of the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the leaders said: »There are no more women in the tribe of Benjamin. What shall we do to provide wives for the men who are left?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Israel must not lose one of its twelve tribes. We must find a way for the tribe of Benjamin to survive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»We cannot allow them to marry our daughters. We have put a curse on anyone who allows a Benjaminite to marry one of our daughters.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said: »The yearly festival of Jehovah at Shiloh is coming soon. Shiloh is north of Bethel, south of Lebonah, and east of the road between Bethel and Shechem.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They told the Benjaminites: »Go hide in the vineyards.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»When the young women of Shiloh come out to dance during the festival, you come out of the vineyards. Each of you should take a wife by force from among them and take her back to the territory of Benjamin with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»If their fathers or brothers come to you and protest, you can tell them: Please let us keep them, because we did not take them from you in battle to be our wives. Since you did not give them to us, you are not guilty of breaking your promise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Benjaminites did this. Each of them chose a wife from the young women who were dancing at Shiloh and carried her away. They went back to their own territory, rebuilt their towns, and lived there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The rest of the Israelites left, and every man went back to his own tribe and family and to his own property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
