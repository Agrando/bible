I have delivered the land into his hand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Judah said to Simeon his brother: »Come up with me to my allotted territory that we may fight against the Canaanites. I likewise will go with you to your territory.« So Simeon went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Judah went up and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand. They killed ten thousand men at Bezek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him. They killed the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Adoni-bezek fled and they chased him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Adoni-bezek said: »Seventy kings with their big toes cut off have gathered food scrapes under my table. God has repaid me for what I have done.« So they brought him to Jerusalem where he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They put it to the sword and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that lived in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Judah went against the Canaanites that lived in Hebron previously called Kirjath-arba and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>From there they advanced against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Caleb said: »He that attacks Kirjath-sepher, and captures it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When she came to him she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey Caleb said to her: »What do you wish?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She said: »Give me a blessing: for you have given me a land south with spring water.« And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The children of the Kenite, Moses father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah to the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad to live with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they attacked the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Judah took Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory as well as Ekron with its territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah was with Judah. He drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised and he expelled the three sons of Anak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem. The Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel: and Jehovah was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him: »Show us the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he showed them the entrance into the city, they struck the city with the edge of the sword. But spared the man and all his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city. He called it Luz, which is its name this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites wanted to live in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Israel was strong they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor. They did not completely drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that lived in Gezer. But the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became forced laborers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became forced laborers to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain. They would not allow them to come down to the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became forced laborers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The boundary of the Amorites was from the Ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
