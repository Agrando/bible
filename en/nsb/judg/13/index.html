So he let the Philistines rule them for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There was a man named Manoah from the town of Zorah. He was a member of the tribe of Dan. His wife was not able to have children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovahs angel appeared to her and said: »You have not been able to have children, but you will become pregnant and have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Do not drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»After your son is born never cut his hair. This is because from the day of his birth he will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite. He will begin the work of delivering Israel from the Philistines.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the woman told her husband: »A man of God came to me. He looked as frightening as the angel of God. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»He told me I would become pregnant and have a son. He told me: Do not drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food. This is because the boy is to be dedicated to God as a Nazirite as long as he lives.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah: »Please, Jehovah, let the man of God that you sent come back to teach us what we must do with the boy when he is born.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God did what Manoah asked. His angel came back to the woman while she was in the field. Her husband Manoah was not with her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She ran to tell him, »The man who came to me the other day appeared to me again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Manoah followed his wife to the man and asked, »Are you the man who talked to my wife?« »Yes,« he answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Manoah said: »When your words come true, what must the boy do? What kind of a life must he live?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovahs angel answered: »Your wife must be sure to do everything I told her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine. She must not drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food. She must do everything I told her to do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Not knowing that it was Jehovahs angel, Manoah said: »Please do not go yet. Let us cook a young goat for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The angel replied: »If I stay I will not eat your food. But if you want to prepare it, burn it as an offering to Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Manoah replied: »Tell us your name. We want to honor you when your words come true.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The angel asked: »Why do you want to know my name? It is Wonderful.« (Isaiah 9:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took a young goat and some grain, and offered them on the rock altar to Jehovah the God who works wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>While the flames were going up from the altar, Manoah and his wife saw Jehovahs angel go up toward heaven in the flames. They did not see the angel again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Manoah knew then that the man was Jehovahs angel. He and his wife fell on their faces to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Manoah told his wife: »We will die, for we have seen God a God-like being!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His wife answered: »If Jehovah wanted to kill us he would not accept our offerings. He would not have shown us all this or told us these things.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The child grew and Jehovah blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehovahs power strengthened him while he was between Zorah and Eshtaol in the Camp of Dan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
