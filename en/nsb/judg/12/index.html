They crossed the Jordan River to Zaphon and said to Jephthah: »Why did you cross the border to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We are going to burn the house down over your head!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jephthah replied: »My people and I had a great struggle with the Ammonites. I called you, but you would not rescue me from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»When I realized you were not going to, I risked my life and crossed the border to fight them. Jehovah gave me victory over them. Why are you coming to fight me now?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jephthah brought all the men of Gilead together and fought the men of Ephraim and defeated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>To keep the Ephraimites from escaping, the Gileadites captured the places where the Jordan could be crossed. When any Ephraimite who was trying to escape would ask permission to cross, the men of Gilead would ask: »Are you an Ephraimite?« If he said: »No,«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>they would tell him to say »Shibboleth.« But he would say »Sibboleth,« because he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they would kill him at the Jordan River crossing. Forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites were killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jephthah led Israel for six years. Then he died and was buried in his hometown in Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>After Jephthah, Ibzan from Bethlehem led Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters in marriage outside the clan and brought thirty young women from outside the clan for his sons to marry. Ibzan led Israel for seven years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>then he died and was buried at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After Ibzan, Elon from Zebulun led Israel for ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He died and was buried at Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel from Pirathon was leader of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys.
