This would find out whether or not the Israelites would obey the commandments that Jehovah gave their ancestors through Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The people of Israel settled down among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They intermarried with them and worshiped their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The people of Israel forgot Jehovah their God. They sinned against him and worshiped the idols of Baal and Asherah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah became angry at Israel and let King Cushan Rishathaim of Mesopotamia conquer them. They were subject to him for eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Israelites cried out to Jehovah, and he sent someone to free them. This was Othniel, the son of Calebs younger brother Kenaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he became Israels leader judge. Othniel went to war, and Jehovah gave him the victory over the king of Mesopotamia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There was peace in the land for forty years until Othniel died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The people of Israel sinned against Jehovah again. Because of this Jehovah made King Eglon of Moab stronger than Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Eglon joined the Ammonites and the Amalekites. They defeated Israel and captured Jericho, the city of palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Israelites were subject to Eglon for eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Israelites cried out to Jehovah. So he sent someone to free them. This was Ehud, a left-handed man, who was the son of Gera, from the tribe of Benjamin. The people of Israel sent Ehud to King Eglon of Moab with gifts for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ehud made himself a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long. He fastened it on his right side under his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He took the gifts to Eglon, who was a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When Ehud gave him the gifts, he told the men who carried them to go back home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Ehud turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal, went back to Eglon, and said: »Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.« So the king ordered his servants: »Leave us alone!« Then they all went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king was sitting there alone in his cool room on the roof. Ehud went over to him and said: »I have a message from God for you.« The king stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>With his left hand Ehud took the sword from his right side and plunged it into the kings belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The whole sword went in, handle and all, and the fat covered it up. Ehud did not pull it out of the kings belly, and it stuck out behind, between his legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ehud went outside, closed the doors behind him, locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he left. The servants came and saw that the doors to the upstairs room were locked. They only thought that the king was inside, relieving himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They waited as long as they thought they should. When he still did not open the door, they took the key and opened it. There lying dead on the floor was their master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ehud got away while they were waiting. He went past the carved stones and escaped to Seirah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he arrived there in the hill country of Ephraim, he blew a trumpet to call the people of Israel to battle. Then he led them down from the hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them: »Follow me! Jehovah has given you victory over your enemies, the Moabites.« So they followed Ehud and captured the place where the Moabites were to cross the Jordan. They did not allow anyone to cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They killed about ten thousand of the best Moabite soldiers. None of them escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That day the Israelites defeated Moab. There was peace in the land for eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The next leader was Shamgar son of Anath. He too rescued Israel, and did so by killing six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
