The Israelites were determined to fight. The people gladly volunteered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you rulers! I will sing and play music to Israels God, Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Jehovah, when you left the mountains of Seir, when you came out of Edom, the earth shook, and rain fell from the sky. Yes, water poured out of the clouds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The mountains shook before Jehovah of Sinai, before Jehovah, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted. Travelers used the back roads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The towns of Israel were abandoned. They stood empty until I Deborah came, came like a mother for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»There was war in the land when the Israelites chose new gods. Of the forty thousand men in Israel, did anyone carry shield or spear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»My heart is with the commanders of Israel, with the people who gladly volunteered. Praise Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Speak of it, you who ride on white donkeys, sitting on saddles. You that must walk wherever you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Listen! The noisy crowds around the wells are telling about Jehovahs victories, the victories of Israels people! Then Jehovahs people marched down from their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Wake up, wake up, Deborah: awake, awake, and utter a song. Arise, Barak, and lead your captives away, you son of Abinoam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Then he made those who remain to dominate over the nobles among the people. Jehovah made me have dominion over the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»They came from Ephraim to the valley. They were behind the tribe of Benjamin and its people. The commanders came down from Machir. The officers came down from Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The leaders of Issachar came with Deborah. Issachar came and Barak too, and they followed him into the valley. But the tribe of Reuben was divided; they could not decide to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Why did they stay behind with the sheep? Did they listen to shepherds calling the flocks? Yes, the tribe of Reuben was divided; they could not decide to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The tribe of Gad stayed east of the Jordan. The tribe of Dan remained by the ships. The tribe of Asher stayed by the seacoast. They remained by the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The people of Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives on the battlefield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The kings fought at Taanach, by the stream of Megiddo. The kings of Canaan fought, but they took no silver away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»As the stars moved across the sky they fought against Sisera.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»The River Kishon swept them away. That ancient flooding river swept them away. March on! March on and be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Then the horses hooves thundered and his mighty steeds stamped the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Curse Meroz, says Jehovahs angel: Curse those who live there. They did not come to help Jehovah. They did not come as soldiers to fight for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, is the most blessed of women. The most blessed of women who live in tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Sisera asked for water. She gave him milk. She brought him cream in a beautiful bowl.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»She took a tent peg in one hand and hammer in the other. She struck Sisera and crushed his skull. Yes, she pierced him through the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»He sank to his knees and fell down at her feet. At her feet he sank. He fell to the ground, dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Siseras mother looked thru the window. From behind the lattice she looked. Why is his chariot so late in coming? She asked. Why are his horses so slow to return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»The wisest of her ladies answered her, and she told herself over and over,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»They are finding things to capture and divide. They find a woman or two for every soldier, rich cloth for Sisera, embroidered pieces for the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»May all your enemies die like that, Jehovah, may your friends shine like the rising sun! There was peace in the land for forty years.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
