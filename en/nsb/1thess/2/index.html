He has judged us worthy to be entrusted with the Good News. We do not try to please people, but to please God, who tests our motives examines our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You know very well that we did not come to you with flattering talk praise for selfish gain. We did not use words to cover up greed insatiable desire for wealth. God is our witness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We did not try to get praise from anyone, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we could have made demands on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But we were gentle when we were with you, like a mother taking care of her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Having much affection for you, we were well pleased to impart the good news of God to you and also to share our lives with you. You have become very dear to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You may remember, brothers, our labor and hardship. We worked day and night that we would not burden any of you when we preached the good news of God to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You and God are witnesses, how devoutly and righteously, without blame, we behaved toward you who believe!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You know how we dealt with each one of you. It was like a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging and showing you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You should walk worthily of God, who called you into his own kingdom and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this purpose we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message, even the word of God, you accepted it, not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You brothers became imitators of the congregations of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus. You also suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They did not please God and are contrary to all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They hindered us from speaking to the nations so that they may be saved. The result was that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we have been taken away from you for a short while. We have been taken away in person, not in spirit. We are all the more eager with great desire to see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We wanted to come to you. I, Paul, wanted to more than once and yet Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is our hope, or joy, or crown of exultation? Is it not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are our glory and joy!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
