(Zephaniah 1:14)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When they say, »Peace and security!« then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come to a pregnant woman.

That day should not overtake you by surprise as a thief would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You are all the children sons of light, and the children of the day.
