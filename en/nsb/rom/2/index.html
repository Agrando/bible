For when you judge another you condemn yourself. After all you do the same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>We are sure that the judgment of God, according to truth, is against those who commit such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>What do you reason O man? When you judge these things, and you also do them, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering? Do you not know that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thanks to your stubborn and unrepentant heart, you store up wrath for yourself, in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He will render to each according to his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He offers everlasting life for those who search for incorruptible glory and honor by enduring in good works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Those who are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will receive wrath and indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There will be tribulation and distress on every person who works evil, for the Jew first and for the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There will be glory, honor and peace to every one who does good works, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God is not partial! God does not play favorites!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For all who have sinned without law will perish without law. All who have sinned under law will be judged under law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The hearers of the law are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When those of the nations, who have no law, practice by nature the things of the law they are a law to themselves even though they do not have any law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They show the work of the law written in their hearts. Their conscience also bears witness, and their thoughts accuse or excuse them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my good news, by Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you are a Jew in name and are resting on the law and taking glory in God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>you know his will. You approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you have confidence that you are a leader of the blind, a light to those in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You are an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You then who teach another, do you teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You who say man should not commit adultery do you commit adultery? You who abhors idols do you rob temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You who boast in the law do you by transgression of the law dishonor God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, just as it is written. (Ezekiel 36:20, 21)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Circumcision is a benefit if you obey the law. But if you are a transgressor of the law your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If therefore someone not circumcised obeys the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be considered circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The uncircumcised person is by nature, fulfilling the law. He will judge you because you transgress the law with your written code and circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He is not a Jew who is one on the outside. Neither is circumcision that which is on the outside in the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he is a Jew who is so on the inside with circumcision of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
