Another who is weak eats only vegetables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Let the one eating not look down on the one not eating. Let the one who does not eat judge him that eats, for God has received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who are you to judge another mans servant? He stands or falls before his own master. Yes, he will be made to stand for God can make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One person judges one day above another. Another person judges every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who regards the day regards it to God and he who does not regard the day does not regard it to God. He, who eats, eats to God, for he gives God thanks. He who does not eat does not eat to God and he gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if we live, we live to God and if we die, we die to God. Therefore should we live or die, we are Gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>To this end Christ both died, and rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Why do you judge your brother? Why do you look down on your brother with contempt? We will all stand before the judgment seat of God Theos.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is written: As I live, says Jehovah, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will acknowledge confess to Jehovah. (Isaiah 45:23)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then every one of us will give account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us not judge one another any more. Let no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean in itself. If someone thinks something is unclean it is unclean to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If because of your food your brother is grieved, you do not walk in love. Do not allow what you eat to destroy the one for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not let the good you do be spoken of as evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he that serves Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let us follow after the things that make for peace, and things that are encouraging to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good neither to eat food, nor to drink wine, nor any thing that causes your brother to stumble or be offended and weakened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you have faith? Have it for yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in that thing that he allows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that doubts is damned if he eats, because he eats not by faith. Whatever is not by faith is sin!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
