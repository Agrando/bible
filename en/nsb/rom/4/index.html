It is not as grace but as a debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who does not work but believes in him who justifies absolves the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>David also pronounces blessing on the man, to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying: »Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Blessed is the man to whom, Jehovah will not impute sin.« (Psalm 32:2)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say: »To Abraham his faith was counted for righteousness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while he was not circumcised. That way he could be the father of all those who believe, though they are not circumcised, that righteousness might be counted to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The father of circumcision to those who not only are circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of faith of our father Abraham that he had when he was not circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world was not through the law but through righteousness by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The law produces wrath violent passionindignation. But where there is no law there is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this reason it is by faith that it may be according to grace divine influenceloving-kindness. The promise may be sure to all descendants! This is not only to that which is of the law, but to that also which is by the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is written: »I have made you a father of many nations.« This was in the presence of God, the one in whom he believed. He gives life to the dead, and calls into being that which does not exist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In hope against hope Abraham believed that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken: »So your descendants will be.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Not being weak in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead he being about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarahs womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet, he looked to the promise of God. He did not waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith. He gave the glory to God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He was fully assured that what he had promised, he was able to perform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»It was counted to him as righteousness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was counted to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It is also for our sake, to whom it shall be counted, who believe in him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification acquittal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
