We should not just please ourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For even Christ did not please himself. However it is written, »The reproaches insults hurled at you have fallen on me.« (Psalm 69:9)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The things written in earlier times were written for our instruction, that we through endurance and the encouragement from the Scriptures might have hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>To this end you may glorify God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one accord languageunited expression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcised for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That the nations might glorify God for his mercy as it is written: »For this cause I will confess you to the people of the nations, and sing to your name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And again he says: »Rejoice, you nations, with his people.« (Deuteronomy 32:43)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again: »Praise Jehovah, all you nations; and laud him, all you people.« (Psalm 117:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, Isaiah says: »Then in that day the nations will search for and turn to the root of Jesse. He will stand as a signal for the peoples. His resting place will be glorious.« (Isaiah 11:10)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nevertheless, brothers, I have written more boldly to you on some points, keeping you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, ministering the good news of God, that the offering of these nations might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I glory in Jesus Christ in my service to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not dare to speak of any of those things that Christ has not accomplished through me. I will lead the nations to obey God in word and deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God. From Jerusalem, and round about Illyricum, I have fully preached the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have strived to preach the good news, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another mans foundation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is written, »To whom he was not announced, they shall see: and those who have not heard shall understand.« (Isaiah 52:15)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I have no more places to go in these parts, and have a great desire these many years to come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When I take my journey to Spain, I will come to you. I trust to see you in my journey, and to be escorted on my way by you, after I have been satisfied with your company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor holy ones in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It pleased them to do so and they are debtors for this. If the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in physical things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come to you in Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I am sure that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I beg you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christs sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted by the holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
