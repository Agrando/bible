What is the benefit of circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Much in every way. First they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what? If some have not believed, will their unbelief make the faith of God of no effect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Certainly not! But let God be true, and every man false. It is written: So that you should be proved righteous in your words and should overcome when you are judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If our unrighteousness defines Gods righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his anger is he? I speak in human terms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not at all! For how will God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But what if my untruth serves Gods glory by making his truth stand out more clearly? Why should I be condemned as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why not say, »Let us do evil so that good may come?« Some people have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing! They should be condemned and they will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Are we Jews in any better condition than the people of the nations? Not at all! I have already shown that Jews and the people of the nations are all under the power of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Scriptures say: »There is no one who is righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»There is no one who has insight. No one seeks God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»All have turned away from God; they have all done wrong. No one does what is right, not even one.« (Psalm 53:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Their throat is an open grave. They have practiced deceit with their tongues. The poison of snakes is under their lips.« (Psalm 5:9)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.« (Psalm 10:7)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Their feet are swift to shed blood.« (Proverbs 1:15)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Destruction and misery are in their ways.« (Isaiah 59:7)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»They have not known the way of peace.« (Isaiah 59:7, 8)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no respect reverence for God before their eyes. (Psalm 36:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law. Every mouth may be stopped and the entire world may become liable to God for punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No flesh will be justified before God by works of the law. Knowledge of sin comes from the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>God makes people righteous through their active faith in Jesus Christ. God does this to all who believe in Christ, because there is no difference at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>being justified freely by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>God displayed Christ publicly as propitiation atonement by his blood through faith. It demonstrated his righteousness. It was through the forbearance of God that he passed by the sins that had taken place before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It showed his righteousness at this present season that he might himself be righteous, and the justifier of he who has faith in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where is the boasting? It is excluded. Is it by law? Is it by works? No, it is by a principle of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We reason therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the nations also? Yes, of the nations also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If God is one he will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we nullify the law through faith? No we do not! In fact, we establish continuestand byuphold the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
