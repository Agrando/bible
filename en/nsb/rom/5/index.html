And we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>We have access to grace Gods favor by faith through him. This is where we stand. We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Not only that, but we also rejoice in our tribulations knowing that tribulation produces endurance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tribulation produces an approved condition and an approved condition produces hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts. It comes through Holy Spirit, which is Gods gift to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>While we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die. Perhaps for the good man some one would even dare to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But God demonstrates commends his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Much more, now justified by his blood, we will be saved from the wrath of God through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son. Being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation restorationatonementdivine favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, through one-man sin entered into the world, and death through sin. So death passed to all men, for all have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Until the law sin was in the world. Sin is not imputed put on account when there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even for those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adams transgression. Adam is in some ways like Christ who came later.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the two are not the same, because Gods gift spiritual endowment is not like Adams sin. It is true that many people died because of the sin of that one man. But Gods grace is much greater, and so is his gift to so many people through the loving-kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there is a difference between Gods gift spiritual endowment and the sin of one man. After the one sin, came the guilty judgment; but after so many sins, comes the undeserved gift of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It was by the transgression of the one that death ruled as king through that one. Even more so shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, rule as kings in life by the one, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The result of one trespass was condemnation for all men. The result of righteousness was justification acquittal, which brings life for all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Through the disobedience of one man many have been made sinners. Yet through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The law came that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased Gods loving kindness increased even more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what for? Just as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
