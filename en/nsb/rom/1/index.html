Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I pray that I might by the will of God successfully come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift so that you may be strengthened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each others faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I want you to know, brothers, that I was often determined to come to you, but was hindered until now, that I might have some fruit among you as well as the rest of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am a debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians, both to the wise, and to the unwise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I am ready to preach the good news to you in Rome also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I am not ashamed of the good news; for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who exerts active faith believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It reveals the righteousness of God from faith-to-faith for it is written: »The righteous shall live by faith.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That which is known about God is clear to them, for God revealed it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His invisible attributes are clearly seen since the creation of the world. The things made prove His eternal power and divine nature. Mankind has no excuse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God. They did not thank him and were vain in their reasoning, for their foolish hearts were darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Claiming to be wise, they became fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God gave them up to uncleanness because of the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creation more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Also the men left the natural use of the woman and burned in their lust, one toward another; men with men working that which is obscene. They receive full recompense due for their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They did not like to retain God in their knowledge, so God gave them over to a reprobate depraved mind, to do things that are not fitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They are filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil mindedness; they are whisperers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, and unmerciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They know the judgment of God, that those who commit such things are worthy of death! And yet, they not only do the same, but also approve of those who do them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
