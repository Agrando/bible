They do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The law of the Spirit gives us life through withbecause of Christ Jesus. It has set me free from the law of sin and death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God did what the Law could not do, because human nature was weak. He sent his own son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering and do away with sin. So he condemned sin in sinful human nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>God did this so that the righteous requirements of the Law might be fully satisfied in us who live according to the Spirit, and not according to human nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They who live according to flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh. They who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The mind of sinful flesh fleshly thought means death; but the mind influenced by the Spirit gives life and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>This is because the mind of the flesh is hostile toward God. It is not subject to the law of God for it cannot be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Those influenced by the sinful flesh cannot please God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed Gods Spirit dwells in you. If any one does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If Christ is with you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit is life on account of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from among the dead dwells with you, he who raised Christ from among the dead shall also make your mortal bodies alive. This is on account of his Spirit that dwells with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, brothers we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh human nature,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for if you live according to flesh, you are about to die. If by the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you have not received a spirit of bondage again causing fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Father, Father! Chaldee: Abba, meaning father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit itself Greek:autos ho pneumaitself the Spirit bears witness with our spirit mind and heart, that we are children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If children, then heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ. If indeed we suffer with him we may also be glorified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the manifestation revelationdisclosure of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was subject to corruption, not by its own will but by reason of the one who subjected it on the basis of hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The creation will also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation groans and is in pain together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>We also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption and the release from our bodies by ransom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We are saved by this hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For does a man hope for what he sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we hope for what we do not see, do we have patience to wait for it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the Spirit also helps our weaknesses. We do not know what we should pray for, as we should. The Spirit of God makes intercession with groaning that cannot be spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he who searches the hearts knows what is the inclination purposemind-set of the Spirit of God, because the Spirit makes intercession for the holy ones according to the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Those he first recognized, he ordained in advance that they be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He ordained in advance the ones he called. He declared righteous the ones he called. He also glorified those he declared righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What shall we then say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who will bring any charge against the ones God has chosen? It is God who justifies makes righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>It is written: »For your sake we are put to death all day long. We are considered as sheep for the slaughter.« (Psalm 44:22)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Ephesians 6:12)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
