Certainly not! I also am an Israelite, a descendant of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God has not rejected his people whom he first knew. Do you remember what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he made intercession to God against Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Jehovah, they have killed your prophets, and torn down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life.« (1 Kings 19:14, 18)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>What does God say in answer to him? »I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so at this present time there is a remnant chosen according to Gods grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If it is by grace then it is no longer on the basis of works. Otherwise grace is not grace undeserved kindness. But if it is of works then it is not by grace. Otherwise works are no longer works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks. The chosen ones have obtained it, and the rest were blinded rendered stupidhardenedmade insensitive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It is written, »God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear to this very day.« (Deuteronomy 29:4)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>David says, »Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and recompense to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.« (Psalm 69:23)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I ask: Did they stumble and fall? Certainly not! But rather through their fall into sin salvation has come to the nations. This will provoke them to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if their fall into sin means riches to the world, and their decrease means riches of the nations how much more will their full number mean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I speak to you people of the nations. For I am the apostle to the nations and I glorify honorpraisecelebrate my ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If by any means I may provoke those who are of my flesh fellow countrymen, and might save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If their rejection means reconciliation for the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If the first piece is holy, the lump is also holy. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Some of the branches are broken off. You, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them. Therefore you partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not boast against the branches. But if you boast, you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say, »The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They were broken off because of unbelief! You stand by faith! Do not be conceited but be reverent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>God did not spare the natural branches and he will not spare you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Observe both Gods kindness and severity. Severity is for those who fail to continue. But kindness is for you as long as you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If they do not continue in unbelief they will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a garden olive tree: how much more could these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I do not want you to be ignorant of this secret, lest you should be wise in your own conceits estimation. Blindness has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the nations comes in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: The deliverer will come out of Zion and will remove ungodliness from Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Concerning the good news, they are enemies for your sakes. With reference to the chosen ones, they are beloved for the fathers sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In times past you have not believed did not obey God. Yet you have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Even so these also do not believe now. Through the mercy shown they also may obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has stopped all disobedience so he might show mercy to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments. His ways are beyond human understanding!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who has known the mind of Jehovah? Or who has been his counselor? (Isaiah 40:13)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Or who has first given to him, that it shall be repaid to him again? (Job 41:11)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For from him, and through him, and to him are all things: Glory to him forever! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
