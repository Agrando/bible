For there is no authority except by God. God allows the authorities to serve in their positions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Whoever opposes the authority resists the ordinance of God. Those who resist will receive judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are objects of fear, not to good works, but to the evil. Will you not have respect for the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid for he does not bear the sword in vain. He is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You must be in subjection, not only because of that wrath, but also for the sake of your conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That is why you pay taxes. They are Gods ministers continually serving this very purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render therefore to all their due. Provide tribute to whom tribute is due. Give custom to whom custom is owed. Render fear to whom fear is owed and offer honor to whom honor is deserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no man any thing but to love one another. He that loves another has fulfilled obeyed the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the Law code says: You must not commit adultery, you must not murder, you must not steal, you must not bear false witness, and you must not covet. If there is any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying; namely, you must love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love works no ill to his neighbor. Therefore love is the laws fulfillment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You know the time. It is the hour for you to awake from sleep. Now our salvation is nearer than when we became believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far along and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk honestly as in the daytime, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and loose conduct, not in strife and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Put on live likeclothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
