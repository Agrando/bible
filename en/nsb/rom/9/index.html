I do not lie! My conscience bears witness with me in Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I could wish that I were accursed separatedbannedexcommunicated from Christ for the good of in behalf of my countrymen and brothers the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They are Israelites and the adoption belongs to them. They have the glory of the covenants. The law was given to them along with the service and promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The forefathers belong to them from whom came the Christ according to the flesh. God who is over all is blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It is not as if the word of God failed. Not all who come from Israel are really Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It is not because they are Abrahams that they are all children, but: »What will be called your seed will be through Isaac.« (Genesis 21:12)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, the children of the flesh are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The word of promise: »According to this time I will come and Sarah will have a son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Not only that, but Rebecca conceived by Isaac our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they had not yet been born nor performed anything good or vile, so the purpose of God regarding the choosing would continue without dependence on works but on the One who calls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She was told: »The older will serve the younger.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It is written: »I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? There is not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He says to Moses, »I will show mercy to the one I choose to show mercy, and I will feel compassion for the one I choose to feel compassion.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then it does not depend on mans will or effort, but on God who shows mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The scripture says to Pharaoh: »For this reason I have raised you up, that I might through you, show my power and declare my name in all the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He shows mercy to the one he chooses, and he allows others to be stubborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You say to me: »Why does he yet find fault? Who resists his purpose will?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yes, but you, O man, who are you to answer back to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: »Why have you made me this way?« (Isaiah 45:9)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or does the potter not have authority over the clay? Can he make out of the same lump one vessel to honor, and another for common use? (Jeremiah 18:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If God decided to show his wrath and make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fit for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that way he could make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy that he had prepared in advance for glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We are the ones he has also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He says also in Hosea: »Those who are not my people I will call my people. And she who is not loved I will call loved.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the place where it was said to them: »You are not my people, they will be called Sons of the living God.« (Hosea 2:23)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: »Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»He is bringing the matter to an end, and cutting it short in righteousness. Jehovah will make an accounting on the earth.« (Isaiah 10:22)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Just as Isaiah said earlier: »Unless Jehovah of Hosts had left a seed to us, we should have become like Sodom, and Gomorrah.« (Isaiah 1:9)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say? The nations did not pursue righteousness. Yet they have attained to righteousness, the righteousness that is based on the principle of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel, pursuing after a law of righteousness, has not attained to that law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why? It is because it was not based on the principle of faith, but on that of works. They have stumbled at the stumbling stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>It is written: »Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence and he that believes on him will not be ashamed.« (Isaiah 8:14)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
