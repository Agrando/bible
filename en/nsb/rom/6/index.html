Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God forbid. We died to sin! How could we any longer live in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Or are you ignorant to the fact that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death. Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, that we might walk in the newness of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be in the likeness of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We know this that our old self was impaled with him that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we should no longer be in bondage to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who has died is freed from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We know that Christ being raised from the dead died no more; death no longer has dominion over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the death that he died, he died with reference to sin once. But the life that he lives, he lives to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Consider yourselves to be dead with reference to sin, but alive with reference to God through Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let no sin rule in your mortal body, that you should obey the lustful desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness. Present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient servants you are his voluntary servants because you obey him? This could be obedience to sin with death in view or obedience to righteousness with holiness in view?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thanks to God, that you were the servants of sin yet you became obedient from the heart to the teachings delivered to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>After being made free from sin, you became servants of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. You once presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to sin. Now you present your members as servants to righteousness and sanctification purificationholiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You are now ashamed of the fruit you had at that time. For the results of these things is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now you are free from sin and are servants to God. You have your fruit in holiness, and the end everlasting eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift from God is everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
