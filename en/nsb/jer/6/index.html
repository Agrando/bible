Run from the midst of Jerusalem! Blow a rams horn in Tekoa and raise a signal over Beth-haccerem. Evil looks down from the north. There is great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will destroy the beautiful and luxurious one, the daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Shepherds and their flocks will come to her. They will pitch their tents around her. They will pasture each in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Prepare for war against her. »Arise, and let us attack at noon.« »Woe to us, for the day declines is nearly over, for the shadows of the evening lengthen!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Arise, and let us attack at night and destroy her palaces!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah of Hosts says: »Cut down trees and build up a siege against Jerusalem. This city should be punished, for there is only oppression in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»As a well pours out its water, so Jerusalem pours out her wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard in her. Sickness and wounds are ever before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Be warned, O Jerusalem, I will be alienated from you. I will make you desolation, a land not inhabited.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehovah of Hosts says: »They will thoroughly glean as the vine the remnant of Israel. Pass your hand again like a grape gatherer over the baskets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»To whom can I speak and give warning that they may hear? Their ears are closed and they cannot listen. Behold, the word of Jehovah has become a reproach to them. They have no delight in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am full of the wrath of Jehovah. I am weary with holding it in. Pour it out on the children in the street and on the gathering of young men together. For both husband and wife will be taken, the aged and the very old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Their houses, their fields and their wives will be turned over to others. I will stretch out my hand extend my power against the inhabitants of the land,« declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»From the least of them even to the greatest of them, everyone is greedy for gain! From the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Superficially they have healed the brokenness of my people. They declare: Peace! Peace! »But there is no peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Are they ashamed because of the abomination they have done? They are not even ashamed! Not at all! They do not even know how to blush. Therefore they will fall among those who fall. When I punish them, they will be cast down,« says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah says: »Stand by the way of life and see and ask for the ancient paths. Walk in the good way and you will find rest.« But you said: »We will not walk in it!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I set watchmen over you. I said: Listen to the sound of the trumpet! But they said: We will not listen!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Hear, O earth: behold, I am bringing disaster on this people as the fruit of their plans. This is because they have not listened to my words, and have rejected my law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»What purpose does frankincense come to me from Sheba and the sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable and your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, Jehovah says: »I am laying stumbling blocks before this people. They will stumble against them, Fathers and sons together; Neighbors and friends will perish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jehovah says: »Behold, a people is coming from the northland! A great nation will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»They seize bow and spear. They are cruel and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses. They are arrayed as a man for the battle against you, O daughter of Zion!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard the report! Our hands are limp. Anguish has seized us! We have pain like a woman in childbirth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Do not go out into the field. Do not walk on the road. The enemy has a sword and terror is on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>O my people put on sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn as for an only son, a lamentation most bitter. For suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»I have made you an assayer and a tester among my people. You will know and assay their course of life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All of them are stubborn rebels. They go about telling false stories. They are copper and iron. They are all corrupt, all of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows blow fiercely and the fire consumes the lead. The refining goes on in vain, but the wicked are not separated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They call them rejected silver, for Jehovah has rejected them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
