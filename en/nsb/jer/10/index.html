Do not be frightened by the signs in the sky because they frighten the nations.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The peoples customs are erroneous and empty. It is wood cut from the forest. It is the work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»They decorate it with silver and with gold. They fasten it with nails and with hammers so that it will not tip over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They are like scarecrows in cucumber fields. They cannot speak. They must be carried, for they cannot walk! Do not fear them! For they can do no harm and they can do no good.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is none like you, O Jehovah. You are great and your name is powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who would not respect you, O King of the nations? It is your right! There is none like you among all the wise men of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They are very stupid and foolish. They teach vanity to a tree. Their idol is wood!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz. It is the work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith. Violet and purple are their clothing. They are all the work of skilled men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah is the true faithfulright God! He is the living God and the everlasting king. The earth quakes at his wrath. The nations cannot endure his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You will say to the idolaters: »The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who made the earth by his power, and established the world by his wisdom; also stretched out the heavens by his understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He speaks, and the water in the sky produces a storm. He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning flash with the rain. He brings wind out of his storehouses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every man is stupid lacking knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols. His molten images are deceitful. There is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are worthless, a work of mockery. In the time of their punishment they will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jacobs share is not like this. For he made everything! Israel is the tribe of his inheritance. Jehovah of Hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Pick up your bundle from the ground, you who dwell under siege!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah says: »I am evicting the inhabitants of the land at this time. I will cause them distress that they may be found.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Oh, I am wounded! My wound is serious. Then I thought that this is my punishment, and I will bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent is destroyed. All the ropes are broken. My children have left me and have disappeared. There is no one to set up my tent again or put up my tent curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The shepherds are foolish. They do not look to Jehovah for help. That is why they will not succeed and all their flocks will be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The report has arrived. Listen! An incredible uproar is coming from the land of the north. Its army will destroy Judah's cities and make them homes for jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O Jehovah, I know that humans are not able to govern their own lives. Humans cannot administer their own steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Correct me, O Jehovah but please be fair. Do not correct me when you are angry. Otherwise, you will reduce me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out your fury on the nations who do not know you and on people who do not worship you. They have devoured the descendants of Jacob. They have devoured them completely. They have destroyed their homes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
