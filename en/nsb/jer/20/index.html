Jeremiah said to him: »Pashhur is not the name Jehovah has called you. He has called you Magor-missabib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»For Jehovah says: Behold, I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies while you watch. I will hand over all Judah to the hand control of the king of Babylon. He will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will also hand over all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its costly things. I will even give all the treasures of the kings of Judah to the hand of their enemies. They will plunder them and take them away to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity. You will enter Babylon, and there you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O Jehovah, You have deceived me. I was deceived! You have overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Each time I speak, I cry aloud. I proclaim violence and destruction! For me the word of Jehovah has resulted in reproach and derision all day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if I say: »I will not remember him or speak anymore in his name,« then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in. I cannot endure it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I have heard the whispering of many: »Terror on every side! Denounce him; yes, let us denounce him!« All my trusted friends are watching for my fall. They say: »Perhaps he will be deceived, so that we may prevail against him and take our revenge on him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah is with me like a powerful champion. Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be utterly ashamed! They have failed with an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet, O Jehovah of Hosts you test the righteous. You see the mind and the heart. Let me see your vengeance on them for to you I have revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing to Jehovah, praise Jehovah! He has delivered the needy one from the hand domination of evildoers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed is the day when I was born. Let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed is the man who brought the news to my father, saying: »A baby boy has been born to you!« He made him very happy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But let that man be like the cities Jehovah overthrew without relenting. Let him hear an outcry in the morning and a shout of alarm at noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He did not kill me before birth, so that my mother would have been my grave, and her womb ever pregnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why did I ever come forth from the womb to look on trouble and sorrow? My days have been spent in shame!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
