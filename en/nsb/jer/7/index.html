They say: This is the Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah, and the Temple of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»»For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly practice justice between a man and his neighbor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor walk after other gods to your own ruin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land I gave to your fathers from generation to generation and for a very long time.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You are trusting in deceptive words that are of no value to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, offer sacrifices to Baal and walk after other gods that you have not known?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Then come and stand before me in this house. It is called by my name. You say, We are safe to do all these abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Has this house, called by my name, become a den of robbers in your sight? Behold, I, even I, have seen it,« declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»But go to my place in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell from the beginning, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»For the reason that you did all these things,« says Jehovah, »I spoke to you. I rose up early and spoke. But you did not hear, and I called you but you did not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Consider what I will do to the house that is called by my name. It is the house in which you trust. It is the place I gave you and your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, all the offspring of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»As for you, do not pray for this people. Do not lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me for I do not hear you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire. The women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods in order to spite me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Do they spite me?« Asks Jehovah. »Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore the Lord Jehovah says: »My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and on beast, on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground. It will burn and not be quenched.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: »Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»I gave them this command: Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. You will walk in all the way that I command you that it may be well with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Yet they did not obey or incline their ear. They walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart. They went backward and not forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Since the day your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all my servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear. Instead they stiffened their neck became stubborn. They did more evil than their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You will speak all these words to them. But they will not listen to you. You will call them but they will not answer you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»You will say to them: This is the nation that did not obey the voice of Jehovah their God or accept correction. Truth has perished and truth has been removed from their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Cut off your hair and cast it away. Take up a cry of sorrow and grief on the bare heights. Jehovah has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»The sons of Judah have done what is evil in my sight,« declares Jehovah. »They placed their detestable things in the house called by my name, to defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire. I did not command this. I would never think of such a thing. It would not come from my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Days are coming, says Jehovah, when it will no longer be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom Ben-hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter. They will bury in Topheth because there is no other place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth. No one will frighten them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I will cause the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem. The land will become a ruin.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
