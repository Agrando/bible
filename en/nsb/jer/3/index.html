Now you want to come back to me!« Says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Lift up your eyes to the bare hills and see. You have had sex with men in every place. You sat by the roadside waiting for them like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled corruptedprofaned the land with your prostitution and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Accordingly the rain has been withheld, and there have been no spring showers. Yet, you have the unashamed conspicuousimpudent look of a prostitute, and you refuse to be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Now you call to me. You say, Father! »You have been my friend ever since I was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Will you hold a grudge forever? Will you always be angry? You have said and done all the evil things that you could.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>During the reign of King Josiah, Jehovah asked me: »Did you see what unfaithful Israel did? She went up every high mountain and under every large tree, and she acted like a prostitute there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I thought that after she had done all this she would come back to me. But she did not come back, and her treacherous unstableunreliablefalse sister Judah saw her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Judah saw that I sent unfaithful Israel away because of her adultery and that I gave Israel her divorce papers. But treacherous Judah, her sister, was not afraid. She also acted like a prostitute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Because she was not concerned about her prostitution. She polluted the land and committed adultery with stone and wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Even after all this, Israel's treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart. She was deceitful,« says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah said to me: »Treacherous Judah was more reprehensible than unfaithful Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Go and proclaim this message to the north: Come back, unfaithful Israel. It is Jehovah speaking. I will no longer frown on you because I am merciful, declares Jehovah. I will no longer be angry with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Admit that you have done wrong! You have rebelled against Jehovah your God. You have given yourself to foreign gods under every large tree. You have not obeyed me, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Return, you disobedient people, proclaims Jehovah. I am your husband. I will take you, one from every city and two from every family, and bring you to Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I will give you shepherds after my own heart. They will be shepherds who feed shepherdleadtend you with knowledge and understanding learningreasoninginsight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»In those days you will be fertile, and your population will increase in the land, says Jehovah. Men will no longer talk about the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah. It will no longer come to mind. They will not remember it, miss it, or make another one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»At that time, they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah. All nations will gather in Jerusalem because the name of Jehovah will be found there. They will no longer follow their own stubborn, evil ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Then the nation of Judah will live with the nation of Israel. They will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave their ancestors as their own inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I wanted to treat you like children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful property among the nations. I thought you would call me Father and not turn away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»But like a wife who is unfaithful to her husband, so you, O house of Israel, were unfaithful me,« says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A voice is heard on the bare hills. It is the crying and the pleading of the people of Israel. They are perverted and have forgotten Jehovah their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Return you backsliding children, and I will forgive you for being unfaithful. See, we have come to you because you are Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Truly the sound from the hills and mountains is the noise of false worship. Truly Jehovah our God will be our salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Ever since we were young, the shameful worship of Baal has taken everything our ancestors worked for, their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»We must lie down in our shame and let our humiliation cover us. Ever since we were young, we and our fathers have sinned against Jehovah our God. We have not obeyed Jehovah our God.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
