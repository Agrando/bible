Then I will forgive their wickedness and their sins.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jeremiah called Baruch, son of Neriah. Jeremiah dictated everything that Jehovah told him. Baruch wrote it all down on a scroll.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jeremiah told Baruch: »I am no longer allowed to go to Jehovahs Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»On a day of fasting, you must read from the scroll Jehovahs message that you wrote as I dictated. You must read it to the people in Jehovahs Temple. You must also read it to all the people of Judah when they come from their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Maybe their prayers will come into Jehovahs presence, and they will turn from their evil ways. Jehovah has threatened these people with his terrifying anger and fury.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Baruch, son of Neriah, did as the prophet Jeremiah commanded him. In Jehovahs Temple he read from the scroll everything that Jehovah had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In the ninth month of the fifth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of King Josiah of Judah, a time for fasting was called. It was a time for all the people in Jerusalem and for everyone who was coming from any city in Judah to Jerusalem to fast in Jehovahs presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Baruch read the scroll containing the words of Jeremiah. Baruch read it to all the people in Jehovahs temple in the room of the scribe Gemariah, son of Shaphan, in the upper courtyard at the entrance of New Gate of Jehovahs Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Micaiah, who was the son of Gemariah and the grandson of Shaphan, heard Baruch read from the scroll everything Jehovah had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he went down to the scribe's room in the king's palace where all the scribes were sitting. The scribe Elishama, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Micaiah told them everything he heard Baruch read from the scroll publicly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then all the officials sent Jehudi, who was the son of Nethaniah, the grandson of Shelemiah, and the great-grandson of Cushi, to Baruch. Jehudi said to Baruch: »Bring the scroll that you read publicly, and come with me.« Baruch, son of Neriah, took the scroll and went with him to see the officers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They said to Baruch: »Please sit down, and read it to us.« So Baruch read it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When they heard everything, they turned to each other in terror. They said to Baruch: »We must tell the king everything.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They asked Baruch: »Please tell us how you wrote all this. Did Jeremiah dictate it to you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Baruch answered: »He dictated everything to me, and I wrote it on the scroll in ink.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The officials said to Baruch: »You and Jeremiah must hide. Do not let anyone know where you are.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After they put the scroll in the side room of the scribe Elishama, they went to the king in the courtyard and told him everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He took the scroll from the side room of the scribe Elishama. Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials standing by the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It was the ninth month, and the king was in his winter house sitting in front of the fire in the fireplace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe's knife and throw them into the fire in the fireplace. He did this until the whole scroll was burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The king and all his attendants did not show any fear or tear their clothes in fear when they heard everything being read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Even when Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he refused to listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. But Jehovah had hidden Baruch and Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After the king burned up the scroll that Baruch had written and that Jeremiah had dictated, Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Take another scroll, and write on it everything that was written on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Say about King Jehoiakim of Judah: This is what Jehovah says: You burned this scroll, and you asked Jeremiah: »Why did you write that the king of Babylon would certainly come to destroy this land and take away people and animals?« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»This is what Jehovah says about King Jehoiakim of Judah: He will have no one to sit on David's throne, and his own corpse will be thrown out and exposed to the heat of day and the cold of night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»»I will punish him, his descendants, and his attendants for their wickedness. They refused to listen. So I will bring on them, on those who live in Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah all the disasters that I have threatened.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch, son of Neriah. As Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it everything that was on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned. They added many similar messages.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
