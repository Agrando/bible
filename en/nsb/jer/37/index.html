Zedekiah succeeded Jehoiakin, son of Jehoiakim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Zedekiah, his administrators, and the common people did not listen to what Jehovah spoke through the prophet Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah. They asked him: »Please pray to Jehovah our God for us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jeremiah was still free to come and go among the people. The people of Jerusalem had not put him in prison yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Pharaoh's army came from Egypt. When the Babylonians who were blockading Jerusalem heard this news, they retreated from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah spoke his word to the prophet Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: Say this to the king of Judah, who sent you to get advice from me: »Pharaoh's army has come out to help you. But it will go back to Egypt, its own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Then the Babylonians will return. They will attack the city, capture it, and burn it down.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Jehovah says: Do not deceive yourselves by thinking that the Babylonians will leave you. They will not leave you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Even if you would defeat the entire Babylonian army so that they had only a few badly wounded men left in their tents, they would get up and burn down this city!« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Babylonian army retreated from Jerusalem because Pharaoh's army was coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jeremiah wanted to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of Benjamin to take possession of his property there among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he came to Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard there, whose name was Irijah, son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah, arrested the prophet Jeremiah. He said: »You are deserting to the Babylonians!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jeremiah answered: »That is not true! I am not deserting to the Babylonians.« But Irijah would not listen to him. Irijah arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The officials were so angry with Jeremiah that they beat him and put him in prison in the scribe Jonathan's house, which had been turned into a prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jeremiah went into a prison cell, and he stayed there a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah, and the king asked him privately in the palace: »Is there any message from Jehovah? Jeremiah answered: Yes! There is a message from Jehovah. You will be handed over to the king of Babylon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah: »What crime have I committed against you, your administrators, or these people? Why have you put me in prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Where are the prophets who told you that the king of Babylon would not attack you and this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Your Majesty, please listen, and accept my plea for mercy. Do not return me to the scribe Jonathan's house, or I will die there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>King Zedekiah gave the command to have Jeremiah put in the courtyard of the prison. He gave him a loaf of bread every day from the bakers' street until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
