King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon defeated his army at Carchemish along the Euphrates River during the fourth year that Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, was king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Get your large and small shields ready and advance into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Harness your horses. Mount up, you horsemen. Take your positions, and put on your helmets. Polish your spears. Put on your armor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»What do I see in them? They are terrified. They are retreating. Their warriors are defeated. They flee without looking back. Terror is all around them!« declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The infantry cannot flee. The warriors cannot escape. They stumble and fall in the north by the Euphrates River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who is this, rising like the Nile River, like streams that flow swiftly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Egypt is like the rising Nile River, like a river quickly overflowing its banks. Egypt says: »I will rise. I will cover the earth. I will destroy cities and the people in them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go into battle, you horsemen. Drive wildly, you chariot drivers. March into battle, you warriors, you warriors from Sudan and Put who carry shields, you warriors from Lydia who use bows and arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That day belongs to Jehovah of Hosts. It is a day of vengeance when he will take revenge on his enemies. His sword will devour until it has had enough, and it will drink their blood until it is full. The Almighty Jehovah of Hosts will offer them as sacrifices in the north by the Euphrates River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go to Gilead, and get medicine, dear people of Egypt. You have used many medicines without results and cannot be cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The nations have heard of your shame. Your cry fills the earth.

They cannot stand because Jehovah will push them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>« They have repeatedly stumbled and now they have fallen. They say to each other: Get up!

At that time they will be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Egypt will hiss like a snake as it slithers away. Its enemies will come with full force. They will attack it with axes like those who chop wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»They will cut down the forest, declares Jehovah, since Egypt cannot be found.
