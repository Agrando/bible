Nebuzaradan found Jeremiah in chains along with the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being taken to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him: »Jehovah your God threatened to bring this disaster on this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»He has carried out his threat. Jehovah did as he promised because you Israelites have sinned against him and refused to obey him. That is why this has happened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Today, I am removing the chains from your hands. If you would like to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. But if you do not want to come with me to Babylon, do not come. The whole land is yours. Go wherever you want.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If you wish to remain, then go back to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed to govern the cities of Judah. Live among the people with him, or go anywhere you want. The captain of the guard gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, at Mizpah and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the army commanders and their men who were in the field heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, to govern the country and some of the country's poorest men, women, and children who had not been taken away to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These are the commanders who went with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai from Netophah, and Jezaniah, who was the son of a man from Maacah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men. He said: »Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians. Live in this country, serve the king of Babylon, and you will prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I am going to live in Mizpah and represent you when the Babylonians come to us. Gather grapes, summer fruit, and olive oil, and put them in storage jars. Live in the cities you have taken over.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All the Jews who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and in all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a few survivors in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to govern them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So all the Jews returned from all the places where they had been scattered. They came to Judah and to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They gathered a large harvest of grapes and summer fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Kareah's son Johanan and all the army commanders who were still in the country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They asked him: »Do you know that King Baalis of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, to kill you?« However, Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Johanan, Kareah's son, secretly asked Gedaliah at Mizpah: »Let me kill Ishmael, Nethaniah's son. No one will know about it. Why should he kill you? All the Jews who have gathered around you would scatter. What is left of Judah would disappear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, told Johanan, Kareah's son: »Do not do that! What you are saying about Ishmael is a lie.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
