Proclaim it and lift up a standard. Do not conceal it but say: Babylon has been captured. Bel has been put to shame. Marduk has been shattered! Her images have been put to shame and her idols have been shattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»A nation has come up against her out of the north. It will make her land an object of horror. There will be no inhabitant in it. Both man and beast wander off. They have gone away!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»In those days and at that time,« declares Jehovah, »the sons of Israel will come. Both they and the sons of Judah will go along weeping as they go. They will seek Jehovah their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They will ask for the way to Zion turning their faces in its direction. They will come to join themselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»My people have become lost sheep. Their shepherds have led them astray. They have made them turn aside on the mountains. They have gone along from mountain to hill and have forgotten their resting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»All who came upon them have devoured them. Their adversaries said: We are not guilty. They have sinned against Jehovah who is the habitation of righteousness, Even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Wander away from the midst of Babylon. Go forth from the land of the Chaldeans. Be also like male goats at the head of the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I am going to stir up an alliance of strong nations from the north and bring it against Babylon. Those nations will take up positions against Babylon. Babylon will be captured from the north. Its enemy's arrows will be like skilled soldiers who don't come back empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The Babylonians will become the prize. All who loot them will get everything they want,« declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»You are happy and excited. You have looted the people who belong to me. You dance around like calves on the grass and neigh like stallions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»But your mother will be greatly ashamed. The woman who gave birth to you will be disgraced. Babylon, you will be the least important nation. You will become a parched desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»No one will live in Babylon because of Jehovahs anger. It will be completely abandoned. Everyone who passes by Babylon will be horrified and hiss at all its wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Take up your positions around Babylon, all you archers with bows. Shoot at it and do not save any arrows. For the people of Babylon have sinned against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Shout a war cry against them on every side. They will surrender. Their towers will fall and their walls will be torn down. Since this is Jehovahs vengeance, take revenge against them. Do to them what they did to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Do not allow anyone in Babylon to plant or harvest. Everyone will turn to his own people and flee to his own homeland because of the enemies' swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The people of Israel are like scattered sheep that lions have chased. The first to devour them was the king of Assyria. The last to gnaw at their bones was King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»This is what Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I will bring the people of Israel back to their pastures. They will eat on Mount Carmel and Mount Bashan. They will eat until they are full on the mountains of Ephraim and Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»In those days and at that time,« says Jehovah, »people will look for Israel's crimes, but they will find none. They will look for Judah's sins, but none will be found. I will forgive the faithful few whom I have spared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Attack the land of Merathaim and the people who live in Pekod. Claim them for me by killing them with a sword, says Jehovah. Do everything I commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The noise of battle and great destruction fills the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»The hammer of the whole earth is broken and shattered. See how desolate Babylon is of all the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I will set traps for you, Babylon. You will be caught, but you will not know it. You will be found and captured because you have opposed Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehovah will open his armory and bring out the weapons of his fury, because Jehovah of Hosts has a job to do in the land of the Babylonians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Attack them from a distance, open their storehouses, pile up their corpses like piles of grain, claim them for me by destroying them, and do not leave anyone behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Kill all their young bulls. Let them go to be slaughtered. How horrible it will be for them when their time has come, the time for them to be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Fugitives and refugees from Babylon are coming to Zion to tell about the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance for his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Call together the archers, the soldiers with bows, against Babylon. Set up blockades around it. Do not let anyone escape. Pay the people of Babylon back for what they have done. Do to them what they did to others. They have disobeyed Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»That is why their young men will die in the streets, and all their soldiers will be silenced that day, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»I am against you, you arrogant city, declares the Lord Jehovah of Hosts. »Your day has come, the time when I will punish you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Those prideful people will stumble and fall, and there will be no one to help them get up. I will light a fire in their cities that will burn up everything around them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jehovah of Hosts says: »All the people of Israel and Judah are oppressed. All their enemies have captured them. They refuse to let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Their defender is strong. His name is Jehovah of Hosts. He will certainly take up their cause in order to bring rest to the land of Israel and unrest to the people who live in Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»A sword will kill the Babylonians and everyone who lives in Babylon,« declares Jehovah. »A sword will kill their officials and their wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»A sword will kill the false prophets. They will become fools. A sword will kill their soldiers and defeat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»A sword will kill their horses, their chariots, and all the foreigners within their ranks. They will become women. A sword will destroy their treasures, and they will be looted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»A drought will diminish their water supply, and it will dry up. Babylon is a land of idols, statues that will go crazy with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»That is why desert animals will live with hyenas. Desert owls will also live there. It will no longer be inhabited or lived in for generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»Babylon will be like Sodom and Gomorrah, and their neighboring cities when I, God, destroyed them. No one will live there. No human will stay there, proclaims Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»People are going to come from the north. A great nation and many kings will rise from the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»They will take hold of bows and spears. They will be cruel and have no compassion. They will sound like the sea when it roars. They will ride horses. They are ready for war, ready to attack you, people of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and he loses courage. Anguish will grip him as pain grips a woman in labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»I will suddenly chase them from their places like a lion coming out of the jungle along the Jordan River into pastureland. I will appoint over Babylon whomever I choose. Who is like me? Who can challenge me? Is there any leader who can stand up to me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Listen to what Jehovah is going to do against Babylon and the things he intends to do to the land of the Babylonians. He will surely drag away the little ones of the flock. He will surely destroy the pasture because of the Babylonians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The earth will quake at the news, »Babylon has been captured!« Its cry will be heard among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
