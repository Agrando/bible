The ears of everyone who hears of it will quiver with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»»This is because they have forsaken me. They have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods. These are gods that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known. They have filled this place with the blood of the blameless innocent.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal. This is not something I commanded or spoke of, nor did it ever enter my mind heartconscience.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»»Therefore days are coming, declares Jehovah, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the valley of Slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I will also make this city a desolation and an object of hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its disasters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life will cause them.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Say to them: Jehovah of Hosts says: »Like this I will break this people and this city. It is just like one breaks a potter's vessel that cannot again be repaired. They will bury in Topheth because there is no other place for burial.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants,declares Jehovah, I will make this city like Topheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like Topheth. They burned sacrifices to the heavenly hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods on the rooftops of all of their houses.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Jehovah had sent him to prophesy. He stood in the court of Jehovahs house and said to all the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel says: I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire disaster that I have declared against it. This is because they have stiffened their necks vigorously resisted so as not to heed my words.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
