Pray to Jehovah our God for us. Pray for all of us who have survived. Once there were many of us. Now there are only a few of us left, as you can see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Pray that Jehovah our God will show us the way we should go and what we should do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I answered: »Very well, then. I will pray to Jehovah our God, just as you have asked. I will tell you what he says. I will not keep back anything from you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then they said to me: »May Jehovah be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not obey all the commandments that Jehovah our God gives you for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Whether it pleases us or not, we will obey Jehovah our God, to whom we are asking you to pray. All will go well with us if we obey him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ten days later Jehovah spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I called together Johanan, all the army leaders who were with him, and all the other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I said to them, »Jehovah, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me with your request said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you are willing to go on living in this land I will build you up and not tear you down. I will plant you and not uproot you. The destruction I brought on you has caused me great sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Stop being afraid of the king of Babylon. I am with you. I will rescue you from his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the reason that I am merciful, I will make him have mercy on you and let you go back home. I Jehovah have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»If you say: »We will not stay in this land, and you disobey Jehovah your God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then you say: »We will go to Egypt, where we will not have to see war, hear the sound of a ram's horn, or be hungry. We will stay there.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Listen to the word of Jehovah, you people who are left in Judah. This is what Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: »Suppose you are determined to go to Egypt, and you go and live there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Then the war that you fear will overtake you, and the hunger you dread will follow you, and you will die there in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»All the people who are determined to go and live in Egypt will die either in war or of starvation or disease. Not one of them will survive, not one will escape the disaster that I am going to bring on them.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Jehovah, the God of Israel, says: Just as my anger and fury were poured out on the people of Jerusalem, so my fury will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You will be a horrifying sight. People will make fun of you and use your name as a curse. You will never see this place again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Then I continued: Jehovah has told you people who are left in Judah not to go to Egypt. And so I warn you now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»You are making a fatal mistake. You asked me to pray to Jehovah our God for you, and you promised that you would do everything that he commands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Now I have told you, but you are disobeying everything that Jehovah our God sent me to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»So then, remember this: you will die in war or of starvation or disease in the land where you want to go and live.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
