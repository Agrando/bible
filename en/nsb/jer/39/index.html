They left by way of the royal garden, went through the gateway connecting the two walls, and escaped in the direction of the Jordan Valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the Babylonian army pursued them and captured Zedekiah in the plains near Jericho. Then they took him to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was in the city of Riblah in the territory of Hamath, and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At Riblah he put Zedekiah's sons to death while Zedekiah was looking on, and he also had the officials of Judah executed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After that, he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him placed in chains to be taken to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Babylonians burned down the royal palace and the houses of the people and tore down the walls of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Finally Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, took away as prisoners to Babylon the people who were left in the city, together with those who had deserted to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He left in the land of Judah some of the poorest people, who owned no property, and he gave them vineyards and fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But King Nebuchadnezzar commanded Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, to give the following order:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go and find Jeremiah and take good care of him. Do not harm him, but do for him whatever he wants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Nebuzaradan, together with the high officials Nebushazban and Nergal Sharezer and all the other officers of the king of Babylon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>had me brought from the palace courtyard. They put me under the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, who was to see that I got home safely. Thus I stayed there among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>While I was still imprisoned in the palace courtyard, Jehovah told me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Tell Ebedmelech the Ethiopian that Jehovah, the God of Israel, said: Just as I said I would, I am going to bring upon this city destruction and not prosperity. When this happens, you will be there to see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I Jehovah will protect you, and you will not be handed over to the people you are afraid of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I will keep you safe, and you will not be put to death. You will escape with your life because you have put your trust in me. I Jehovah have spoken!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
