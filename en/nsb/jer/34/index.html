This is what he said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: Go to King Zedekiah of Judah, and tell him, Jehovah says: »I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon. He will burn it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»You will not escape from him. You will certainly be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will talk to you face to face. Then you will go to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Listen to the word of Jehovah, King Zedekiah of Judah. This is what Jehovah says about you: You will not die in war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You will die peacefully. People will burn funeral fires for you as they did for your ancestors, the kings who lived before you. They will say: »Oh, master, as they mourn for you. I have spoken my word, declares Jehovah.« « «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The prophet Jeremiah told all these things to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He did this when the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and the cities of Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities of Judah that were left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah after King Zedekiah and all the people in Jerusalem promised to free their slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Everyone was supposed to free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female. No one was supposed to keep another Jew as a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the officials and all the people agreed and promised to free their male and female slaves and not to keep them as slaves anymore. So they set them free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Later they changed their minds and took back the men and women they had freed and made them their slaves again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jehovah continued to speak his word to Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: I put a condition on the covenant I made to your ancestors when I brought them from Egypt, where they were slaves. I said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Every seven years each of you must free any Hebrews who sold themselves to you. When they have served you for six years, you must set them free. But your ancestors refused to obey me or listen to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»You changed and did what I consider right. You agreed to free your neighbors, and you made a covenant in my presence, in the Temple that is called by my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Now you have changed again and dishonored me. You brought back the male and females slaves that you had set free to live their own lives. You have forced them to be your male and female slaves again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»This is what Jehovah says: You did not obey me. You have not freed your relatives and neighbors. Now I am going to free you, declares Jehovah. I will free you to die in wars, plagues, and famines. I will make all the kingdoms of the world horrified at the thought of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will hand over the people who have rejected my covenant. They have not kept the terms of the covenant they made in my presence when they cut a calf in two and passed between its pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will hand over the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the palace officials, the priests, and all the common people who passed between the pieces of the calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will hand them over to their enemies who want to kill them. Their corpses will be food for birds and wild animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will hand King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who want to kill them and to the army of the king of Babylon, the army that has withdrawn from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»I am going to give a command, declares Jehovah. I will bring that army back to this city to attack it, capture it, and burn it down. I will destroy the cities of Judah so that no one will live there.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
