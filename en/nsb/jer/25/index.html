This was the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and to everyone who lived in Jerusalem. He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Jehovah continued to speak his word to me for twenty-three years. This covered the time from when Josiah, son of Amon, was in his thirteenth year as king of Judah until today. I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Jehovah has sent all his servants the prophets to you. Yet, you have not listened or paid attention to them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The prophets said: »Turn from your evil ways and the evil you have done, and live in the land that Jehovah permanently gave to you and your ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them. Do not make me furious about the idols your hands have shaped. Then I will not harm you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You have not listened to me, declares Jehovah. You have made me furious about the idols your hands have shaped. You have brought harm upon yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»This is what Jehovah of Hosts says: »You did not listen to my words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>so I am going to send for all the families from the north. I will also send for my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon,« says Jehovah. »I will bring the families from the north to attack this land, its people, and all these surrounding nations. I am going to destroy them and turn them into something terrible, something ridiculed, and something permanently ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I will take from them the sounds of joy and happiness, the sounds of brides and grooms, the sound of mills, and the light of lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»This whole land will be ruined and become a wasteland. These nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»When the seventy years are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation for their crimes, declares Jehovah. I will turn Babylon into a permanent wasteland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I will bring on that land all the disasters I threatened to do to it, everything that Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations, everything written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Many nations and great kings will make slaves of the people of Babylon. I will pay them back for what they have done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»This is what Jehovah the God of Israel said to me: Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my fury, and make all the nations to whom I am sending you drink from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»When they drink from it, they will stagger and go insane because of the wars that I am going to send them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So I took the cup from Jehovahs hand. I made all the nations to whom Jehovah sent me drink from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jerusalem and the cities of Judah as well as its kings and officials drank from it. When they drank from it, they became wastelands and ruins, something ridiculed and cursed, until today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I also made these people drink from it: Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, officials, all his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and all the foreign people living among them; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of Philistia, those from the cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, and Ekron, and the people left in Ashdod;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Edom, Moab, and the people of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>all the kings of Tyre and Sidon, and the kings on the seacoast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who shave the hair on their foreheads;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the foreign people living in the desert;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>all the kings of the north, near and far, one after another-all the kingdoms of the earth. Last of all, the king of Sheshach will drink from the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Jehovah said: Say to them, This is what Jehovah of Hosts, »the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk, vomit, fall down, and do not get up because of the wars that I am going to send you.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink from it, say to them: This is what Jehovah of Hosts says: »You must drink from it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»I am going to bring disaster on the city that is named after me. Do you think you will go unpunished? You will not go unpunished! I am declaring war on all those who live on earth, declares Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»That is why you will prophecy all these things to them and say: Jehovah roars from above. He thunders from his holy dwelling place. He roars against his land. He shouts like those who stomp grapes. He shouts against all those who live on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»The sound is echoing to the ends of the earth because Jehovah has brought charges against the nations. He will judge all humans. He will kill the wicked, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»This is what Jehovah of Hosts says: Disaster is spreading from nation to nation. A great storm is brewing from the distant corners of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»On that day those killed by Jehovah will stretch from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, taken away, or buried. They will become like manure on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Mourn, you shepherds, and cry. Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. The time has come for you to be slaughtered. The time has come for you to be scattered, and you will break like fine pottery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»There will be no place for the shepherds to flee, no escape for the leaders of the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»The shepherds are crying and the leaders of the flock are mourning because Jehovah is stripping their pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»The peaceful pastures are destroyed by Jehovahs burning anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»He has left his lair like a lion. Their land has been ruined because of the heat of the oppressor, because of the fury of his anger.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
