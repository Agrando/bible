I give it to anyone I please.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Now I have handed all these countries over to my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have even made wild animals serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until Babylon is defeated. Then many nations and great kings will make him their slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Suppose nations or kingdoms will not serve or surrender to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I will punish those nations by wars, famines, and plagues, until I have put an end to them by Nebuchadnezzar's power,« says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Do not listen to prophets, mediums, and interpreters of dreams, fortunetellers, or sorcerers who tell you, You will never serve the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»They prophesy lies to you. They will cause you to be taken far from your lands. I will scatter you, and you will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»If a nation surrender to the king of Babylon and serve him I will let it stay in its own land. People will farm the land and live on it,« says Jehovah.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I spoke the same message to King Zedekiah of Judah: »Surrender to the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and you will stay alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Why should you and your people die in wars, famines, and plagues? Jehovah has threatened the nations that do not serve the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Do not listen to the prophets who tell you, You will never serve the king of Babylon. They prophesy lies to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I did not send them,« declares Jehovah. »They prophesy lies in my name. So I will scatter you, and you and the prophets will die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also spoke this message to the priests and all the people. This is what Jehovah said to me: »Do not listen to the prophets who tell you that the utensils of Jehovahs Temple will be brought back from Babylon soon. They prophesy lies to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Do not listen to them. Instead, serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city be turned into rubble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»If they are prophets and Jehovah is speaking to them, they should beg Jehovah of Hosts not to allow the utensils that are left in Jehovahs Temple, in the royal palace of Judah, and in Jerusalem to be taken away to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Jehovah of Host reports concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the stands and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the House of Jehovah and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»They will be carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day I visit them,« declares Jehovah. »Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.« «</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
