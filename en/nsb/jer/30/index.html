I will bring them back to the land that I gave their ancestors, and they will take possession of it.« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are the words Jehovah spoke about Israel and Judah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah said: »We hear cries of fear. We hear cries of panic. But we do not hear cries of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Ask now and see: Can a man give birth to a child? Why, then, do I see every strong man holding his stomach in pain like a woman giving birth to a child? Why has every face turned pale?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»How terrible that day will be! There will be no other day like it. It will be a time of calamity for the descendants of Jacob, but they will be rescued from it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»On that day,« declares Jehovah of Hosts, »I will break the yokes off your necks and tear off your ropes. Foreigners will no longer make you serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»You will serve Jehovah your God and David your king. I will establish him for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Do not be afraid, my servant Jacob,« proclaims Jehovah. »Do not be terrified, Israel. I am going to rescue you from a faraway place. I am going to rescue your descendants from where they are captives. The descendants of Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will frighten them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I am with you. I will rescue you,« declares Jehovah. »I will completely destroy all the nations where I scattered you, but I will not completely destroy you. I will correct you with justice. I will not let you go entirely unpunished.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is what Jehovah says: »Your wound is incurable. Your injury is beyond healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»No one argues that you should be healed. But no medicine will heal you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»All your lovers have forgotten you, and they do not want you anymore. I have punished you as an enemy would. I have corrected you as a cruel person would. You are very wicked, and you have many sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Why do you cry about your wound, your injury that cannot be cured? I have done this to you. You are very wicked, and you have many sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»That is why everyone who devours you will be devoured, and all your enemies will be taken away as captives. Those who looted you will be looted. Those who stole from you in war will have things stolen from them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I will restore your health and heal your wounds,« proclaims Jehovah. »People call you an outcast: Zion, no one cares for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»This is what Jehovah says: »I am going to bring the captives back to Jacob's tents and show compassion on their homes. Cities will be built on the ruins, and fortified palaces will be built in their rightful place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»The people who live there will sing songs of praise. The sound of laughter will be heard from there. I will make them numerous, and their number will not decrease. I will bring them honor, and they will not be considered unimportant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Their children will be like they were long ago. Their community will be established in my presence, and I will punish everyone who oppresses them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Their leader will be someone from their own people. Their ruler will come from among them. I will bring him near, and he will come close to me. Who would dare to come near me?« Declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»You will be my people, and I will be your God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The storm of Jehovah will come with his anger. Like a driving wind, it will swirl down on the heads of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jehovahs burning rage will not turn back until he has done everything he intends to do. You will understand this clearly in the last days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
