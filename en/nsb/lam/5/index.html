Take note and see our shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Our heritage is turned over to men of strange lands, our houses to those who are not our countrymen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We are children without fathers. Our mothers are like widows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We give money for a drink of water. We get our wood for a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Our attackers are on our necks. We are overcome with weariness and we have no rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have given our hands to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians so that we might have enough bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers were sinners and are dead. The weight of their evil deeds is on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Servants rule over us, and there is no one to free us from their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We risk our lives to get food, because of the sword of the wasteland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from the need of food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They took by force the women in Zion, the virgins in the towns of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They put princes to death by hanging. The elders are not honored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The young men crushed the grain, and the boys fell under the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The old men are no longer seated in the doorway. The music of the young men has come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The joy of our hearts has ended; our dancing is changed into sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The crown has been taken from our head. Sorrow is ours, for we are sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of this our hearts are feeble. For these things our eyes are dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The mountain of Zion is a waste. So jackals go there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You, O Jehovah, are seated as King forever. The seat of your power is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Why have we gone from your memory forever? Why have you turned away from us for so long?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Make us come back to you, O Jehovah, and let us be restored. Make our days new again as in the past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have rejected us. You are full of wrath against us!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
