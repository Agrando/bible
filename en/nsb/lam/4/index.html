How changed is the best gold! The stones of the holy place are dropping out at the top of every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The valued sons of Zion are valued like the best gold. They are looked on as vessels of earth, the work of the hands of the potter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even the jackals of the wasteland have full breasts and give milk to their young ones. The daughter of my people has become cruel like the ostriches in the wasteland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The tongue of the child at the breast is fixed to the roof of his mouth for need of drink. The young children cry out for bread, and no man gives it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those used to feasting on delicate food are wasted in the streets. Those who as children were dressed in purple are stretched out on the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overturned suddenly without a hand lifted to help her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Her holy ones were cleaner than snow. They were whiter than milk. Their bodies were redder than corals. Their form was like the sapphire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their face is blacker than night. In the streets no one has knowledge of them. Their skin is hanging on their bones, and they are dry, they have become like wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those killed by the sword are better off than those who died of starvation. For these die slowly and waste away from lack of food from the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children. They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah has given full vent to his rage. He has poured out his burning anger. He set a fire in Zion causing the destruction of its foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To the kings of the earth and to all the people of the world it did not seem possible that the attackers and the enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It is because of the sins of her prophets and the evil doing of her priests. They have drained the blood of the upright out from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They are wandering like blind men in the streets. They are polluted with blood. Men may not touch their robes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Get away! Unclean!« They were cried out to them, »Away! Away! Let no one touch.« They went away in flight and wandering, men said among the nations, »There is no further resting-place for them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah has sent them in all directions. He will no longer take care of them. They had no respect for the priests and gave no honor to the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Our eyes are still wasting away in looking for our false help. We watch for a nation unable to give salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They go after our steps so that we may not go in our streets. Our end is near. Our days are numbered. Our end has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Those who went after us were quicker than the eagles of the heaven. They drive us before them on the mountains. They wait secretly for us in the wasteland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The breath of our nostrils, Jehovahs anointed have been captured in their pits.« We said, »Under the shadow we live among the nations.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have joy and be glad, O daughter of Edom, living in the land of Uz. The cup will be given to you in your turn, and you will be overcome with wine and your shame will be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The punishment of your evil doing is complete, O daughter of Zion; never again will he take you away as a prisoner. He has turned his attention to your error, O daughter of Edom. He has uncovered your sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
