The others may not. The people must not come along with Moses.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Moses told the people all Jehovahs words and legal decisions. Then all the people answered with one voice: »We will do everything Jehovah told us to do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moses wrote down all Jehovahs words. Early the next morning he built an altar at the foot of the mountain. He erected twelve sacred stones for the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moses sent young men to burn sacrifices to Jehovah. They sacrificed some cattle as peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moses took half of the blood of the animals and put it in bowls. The other half he threw against the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He took the book of the covenant, in which Jehovahs commandments were written, and read it aloud to the people. They said: »We will obey Jehovah. We will do everything that he has commanded.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moses took the blood from the bowls and sprinkled it on the people. Next, he told them: With this blood Jehovah makes his agreement with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moses and Aaron, together with Nadab and Abihu and the seventy leaders, went up the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something that looked like a pavement made out of sapphire. It was as bright as the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even though these leaders of Israel saw God, he did not punish them. So they ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jehovah said to Moses: »Come up on the mountain and stay here for a while. I will give you the two stone tablets on which I have written the laws that my people must obey.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moses and Joshua his assistant got ready. Moses started up the mountain to meet with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said to the elders: »Wait here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are with you. Anyone with a legal matter should approach them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moses went up to the mountain. The cloud covered the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The glory of Jehovah rested on Mount Sinai. The cloud covered it for six days. God called to Moses on the seventh day. He spoke from inside the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To the eyes of the Israelites the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain. He was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
