Place six names on each stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the same way a jeweler engraves a signet ring. Mount them in gold settings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Then fasten them on the shoulder straps of the ephod as reminders of who the Israelites are. In this way Aaron will carry their names on his shoulders as a reminder in Jehovahs presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Make gold settings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Also make two chains of pure gold.
