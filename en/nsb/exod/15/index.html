He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Jehovah is my strong defender. He is the one who has saved me. He is my God, and I will praise him, my fathers God, and I will sing about his greatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Jehovah is His name, and he is a warrior!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»He threw the chariots and army of Egypts king into the Red Sea, and he drowned the best of the kings army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The depths have covered them. They sank to the bottom just like boulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»With the tremendous force of your right arm, Jehovah, you crushed your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»In the greatness of your excellence you overthrow those who rose up against you. You sent your wrath and consumed them like stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»With a blast from your nostrils, the water piled up. The waves stood up like a dam. The deep water thickened in the middle of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The enemy said: I will pursue them! I will catch them! I will divide the loot! I will take all I want! I will use my sword! I will take all they have!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Your breath blew the sea over them. They sank like lead in the raging water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Who among the gods is like you Jehovah? Who is like you, wonderful in holiness? Who can work wonders and mighty acts like yours?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed our enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Using your powerful love, you rescued redeemed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Nations learned of this and trembled. The Philistines shook with horror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The sheiks chiefs of Edom were dismayed. The leaders of Moab are griped with fear. The inhabitants of Canaan are filled with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Terror and dread fall upon them. By the greatness of your arm they are motionless as stone. Until your people pass over, O Jehovah, until the people pass over whom you have purchased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»You will bring them and plant them on your own mountain, the place where you live, O Jehovah, the holy place that you built with your own hands, O Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Jehovah will rule as king forever and ever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When Pharaohs horses, chariots, and cavalry went into the sea, Jehovah made the water of the sea flow back over them. The Israelites had gone through the sea on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The prophet Miriam, Aarons sister, took a tambourine in her hand. All the women, danced with tambourines, and followed her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Miriam sang to them: »Sing to Jehovah. He has won a glorious victory. He has thrown horses and their riders into the sea.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses led Israel away from the Red Sea into the desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water because it tasted bitter. That is why the place was called Marah Bitter Place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The people complained about Moses. They asked: »What can we drink?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Moses cried out to Jehovah. Jehovah showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. Jehovah presented laws and rules for them to live by. He tested them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said: »If you will listen carefully to Jehovah your God and do what he considers right, if you pay attention to his commands and obey all his laws, I will never make you suffer any of the diseases I made the Egyptians suffer. I am Jehovah, who heals you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they went to Elim. There were twelve springs and seventy palm trees. They camped there by the water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
