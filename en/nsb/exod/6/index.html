I will show him my power. He will let my people go! I will show him my power, and he will throw them out of his country.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God spoke further to Moses and said to him: »I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name, Jehovah, I did not make myself known to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as foreigners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel. This is because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage. I have remembered my covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Tell the sons of Israel: I am Jehovah. I will bring you out from under the oppression of the Egyptians. I will free you from slavery! I will rescue you with my powerful arm and with mighty acts of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I will make you my people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am Jehovah your God. I brought you out from under the forced labor of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I will bring you to the land I solemnly swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as your own possession. I am Jehovah!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moses reported this to the Israelites. But they would not listen to him. For they were so discouraged by their backbreaking work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jehovah told Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Demand that Pharaoh king of Egypt let the sons of Israel go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Moses replied: »I am not a powerful speaker. If the sons of Israel will not listen to me, why should the king of Egypt?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah sent Aaron and Moses with a message for the sons of Israel and for the king. He also ordered Aaron and Moses to free the people from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The following men were the heads of their fathers households: The sons of Reuben, Jacobs oldest son, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari.

How then will Pharaoh listen to me?«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
