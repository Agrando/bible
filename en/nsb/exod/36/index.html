They will do this with the help of every other craftsman to whom Jehovah has given the necessary skills and talents. They will know how to do all the work for constructing the holy place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman to whom Jehovah gave these skills and who was willing to come and do the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Moses provided them with all the contributions the Israelites brought for the work of constructing the holy place. Plus, the people still kept bringing him voluntary freewill offerings every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the skilled men who were doing the work went</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>to Moses. They said: »The people are bringing more than is needed for the work Jehovah commanded to be done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moses sent a command throughout the camp, saying: »No one is to make any further contribution for the sacred Tent.« So the people did not bring any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What had already been brought was sufficient to finish all the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The most skilled men among those doing the work made the Tent of Jehovahs presence. They made it out of ten pieces of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Each curtain was forty-two feet long and six feet wide. They were all the same size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Five of the curtains were sewn together. The other five were also sewn together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They made fifty violet loops along the edge of the end curtain in each set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They placed the loops opposite sides of each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They also made fifty gold fasteners. They used them to link the two sets of curtains together so that the inner tent was a single unit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Eleven curtains were made of goats hair to form an outer tent over the inner tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Each of the eleven curtains was forty-five feet long and six feet wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Five of the curtains were sewn together into one set, and the remaining six into another set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in each set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Fifty bronze fasteners were also made to link the inner tent together as a single unit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a cover out of rams skins that had been dyed red for the outer tent, and over that they put a cover made of fine leather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A framework for the inner tent was made out of acacia wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Each frame was fifteen feet long and twenty-seven inches wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Each had two identical pegs. They made all the frames for the inner tent this same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They made twenty frames for the south side of the inner tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they made forty silver sockets placed at the bottom of the twenty frames. There were two sockets at the bottom of each frame for the two pegs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Twenty frames were also made for the north side of the inner tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Forty silver sockets were prepared with two at the bottom of each frame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They made six frames for the far end, the west side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They made two frames for each of the corners at the far end of the inner tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They were held together at the bottom and held tightly at the top by a single ring. Both corner frames were made this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There were eight frames with sixteen silver sockets. There were two at the bottom of each frame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They also made crossbars out of acacia wood. Five were for the frames on one side of the inner tent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>five were for those on the other side, and five were for the frames on the far side of the inner tent, the west side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The middle crossbar was made so that it ran from one end to the other, halfway up the frames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They covered the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also covered the crossbars with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They made the canopy out of violet, purple, and bright red yarn and fine linen yarn. A cherubim angel design was creatively worked into the fabric.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Four posts of acacia wood were prepared for it. They covered them with gold. They made gold hooks for the posts. They cast four silver bases for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They made a screen out of fine linen yarn for the entrance to the outer tent. It was embroidered with violet, purple, and bright red yarn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They also made five posts with hooks for hanging the screen. They covered the tops of the posts and the bands with gold. The five bases for the posts were made of copper.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
