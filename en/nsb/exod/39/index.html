They also made the holy clothes for Aaron. They obeyed Jehovahs instructions to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The ephod was made out of fine linen yarn and gold, violet, purple, and bright red yarn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The gold was hammered into thin sheets and cut up. They twisted the gold into threads, which they creatively worked into each strand of the violet, purple, and bright red yarn, and throughout the fine linen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>From this they made two shoulder straps for the ephod and attached them to its sides, so that it could be fastened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The finely woven belt, made of the same materials, was attached to the ephod so as to form one piece with it. This was as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They prepared the carnelians and mounted them in gold settings. They were skillfully engraved with the names of the twelve sons of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They placed them on the shoulder straps of the ephod to represent the twelve tribes of Israel. Again, this was just as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The breast piece was made of the same materials as the ephod and with similar embroidery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It was square and folded double, nine inches long and nine inches wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They mounted four rows of precious stones on it. Ruby was mounted on the first row along with topaz, and garnet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Included in the second row was an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The third row contained a turquoise, an agate, and an amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The fourth row contained a beryl, a carnelian, and jasper. These were mounted in gold settings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Each of the twelve stones had engraved on it the name of one of the sons of Jacob, in order to represent the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They made chains out of pure gold, twisted like ropes. These were for the breastplate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Two gold settings and two gold rings were prepared and attached, the two rings to the top two corners of the breast piece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They fastened the two gold ropes to the rings at the top corners of the breastplate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They fastened the other ends of the ropes to the two settings on the shoulder straps of the ephod. The breastplate hung in front of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made two gold rings and fastened them to the other two corners of the breast piece on the inside edge next to the ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They made two more gold rings and fastened them to the bottom of the shoulder straps on the front of the ephod. This was close to the seam just above the belt of the ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Finally they fastened the breast piece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord. So the breast piece was attached just above the belt of the ephod and was held in place. They followed Jehovahs instructions to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They made the robe that is worn with the ephod. It was woven entirely of violet yarn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The opening in the center of the robe had a finished edge, somewhat like a leather collar, all around it to keep it from tearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of violet, purple, and bright red yarn, and fine yarn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Bells were made out of pure gold. They were fastened in between the pomegranates all around the hem of the robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A gold bell alternated with a pomegranate all around the hem of the robe that is worn by Aaron when he served as priest. They followed Jehovahs instructions to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They wove inner robes out of fine linen for Aaron and his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They also made the chief priests turban and the other beautiful turbans out of fine linen. They made the undergarments and belt out of fine linen yarn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The belt was embroidered with violet, purple, and bright red yarn. They followed Jehovahs instructions to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The flower-shaped medallion, the holy crown, was fashioned out of pure gold. The statement: HOLY TO JEHOVAH was engraved on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They fastened a violet cord to it and tied it on top of the turban. They followed Jehovahs instructions to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So all the work on the inner tent of the tent of meeting was now done. The Israelites obeyed all Jehovahs instructions to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They brought everything to Moses: the inner tent, the outer tent and all its furnishings, the fasteners, frames, crossbars, posts, sockets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the cover made of rams skins dyed red, the cover made of fine leather, the canopy over the Ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the Ark containing the words of Gods covenant with its poles and the throne of mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>the table with all the dishes, the bread of the presence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>the pure gold lamp stand with its lamps in a row and all its utensils, the olive oil for the lamps,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the gold altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the entrance to the tent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>the copper altar with its copper grate, its poles, and all its accessories, the basin with its stand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>the curtains for the courtyard, the posts, bases, and screen for the entrance to the courtyard, the ropes and pegs, all the equipment needed for the service of the inner tent for tent of meeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>the special clothes worn when serving as priests in the holy place, both the holy clothes for the priest Aaron and the clothes for his sons when serving as priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The Israelites did all the work according to Jehovahs instructions to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Moses inspected all the work. He saw that they had followed Jehovahs instructions. So Moses blessed them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
