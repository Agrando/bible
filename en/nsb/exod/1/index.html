The total number of Jacobs descendants was seventy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Joseph, all his brothers, and that entire generation died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The children of Israel had many children. They became so numerous and strong that the land was filled with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, began to rule in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to his people: »There are too many Israelites! They are stronger than we are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»We must outsmart them or they will increase in number. If war breaks out they will leave the country and join our enemies to fight against us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the Egyptians put slave masters over them in order to oppress them through forced labor. They built Pithom and Rameses as supply storage cities for Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>However the more the Israelites were oppressed, the more they increased in number and spread out. The Egyptians could not stand them any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They forced the Israelites to work hard as slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They made their lives bitter with backbreaking work in mortar and bricks and every kind of work in the fields. All the jobs the Egyptians gave them were brutally hard work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives. Shiphrah and Puah were among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said: »When you help the Hebrew women give birth on the birth stool, if it is a son you shall put him to death. If it is a daughter, then she shall live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The midwives respected God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them. They let the boys live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said: »Why have you let the boys live?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The midwives replied to Pharaoh: »Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women. They are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because the midwives respected God, He established households for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: Every son who is born must be thrown into the Nile River. However, keep every daughter alive.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
