After that he will let you leave. In fact, he will drive all of you out of here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Speak to the people of Israel and tell all of them to ask their neighbors for gold and silver jewelry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah made the Egyptians respect the Israelites. Indeed, the officials and all the people considered Moses to be a very great man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moses approached the king. He said: »I have come to let you know what Jehovah is going to do. About midnight he will go through the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and wherever he goes, the first-born son in every family will die. Your own son will die. So will the son of the lowest slave woman. Even the first-born males of cattle will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying. Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not even bark, whether against man or beast. This is so you may understand how Jehovah makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me. They will say: »Go out, you and all the people who follow you. Then I will go out.« He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jehovah said to Moses: »Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my signs will be multiplied in the land of Egypt.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh. Yet Jehovah hardened Pharaohs heart. He did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
