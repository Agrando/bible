They said: »Jehovah, the God of Israel, says: Let My people go that they may celebrate a feast to me in the wilderness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But Pharaoh responded: »Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, and besides, I will not let Israel go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then they said: »The God of the Hebrews met with us. Please, let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness. Then we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God. Otherwise he will fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The king of Egypt replied: »Moses and Aaron, why do you distract the people from their work? Get back to work!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Pharaoh added: »Look how many people there are in the land! Do you want them to quit working?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pharaoh gave these orders to the slave drivers and foremen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Do not give the people any more straw to make bricks as you have been doing. Let them gather their own straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Insist that they make the same number of bricks they were making before. Making fewer bricks will not be acceptable. They are lazy! That is why they are crying: Let us go offer sacrifices to our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Make the work harder for these people so that they will be too busy to listen to lies.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The slave drivers and the Israelite foremen went out and said to the Israelites: »The king has said that he will not supply you with any more straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»He says that you must go and get it for yourselves wherever you can find it. You must still make the same number of bricks.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people went all over Egypt looking for straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The slave bosses were hard on them. They kept saying: »Each day you have to make as many bricks as you did when you were given straw.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The bosses beat the men in charge of the slaves and said: »Why did you not force the slaves to make as many bricks yesterday and today as they did before?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Finally, the men in charge of the slaves went to the king and asked: »Why are you treating us like this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»No one brings us any straw. Yet we are still ordered to make the same number of bricks. We are beaten with whips, and your own people are to blame.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The king replied: »You are lazy. You are just lazy! That is why you keep asking me to let you go and sacrifice to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Get back to work! You will not be given straw, but you must still make the same number of bricks.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told: »Do not make fewer bricks each day than you are supposed to.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Leaving the Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said: »May Jehovah see what you have done and judge you! You have made Pharaoh and his officials hate us. You have given them an excuse to kill us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses went back to Jehovah and asked: »Why have you brought this trouble on your people? Why did you send me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak for you, he has treated your people cruelly, and you have done nothing at all to rescue your people.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
