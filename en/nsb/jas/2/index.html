Do not favor one person over the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A man wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in shabby clothes comes into your synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You pay special attention to the one wearing the fine clothes, and say: "Sit here in a good place." Then you say to the poor man: "Stand there," or "Sit under my footstool."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Listen, my dearly beloved brothers! Did God choose poor people in the world to be rich in faith and to receive the kingdom he promised to those who love him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have dishonored the poor man. Do the rich oppress you, and personally drag you into court?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when you show partiality you commit sin. The law then convicts you as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whoever obeys the whole law and yet stumbles in one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said: "Do not commit adultery," also said: "Do not murder" Greek: phoneuo: kill, slay, murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You should speak and act as men who are to be judged by a law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment is without mercy to him who shows no mercy. And mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith but he does not have works? Can that faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is without clothes and in lack of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says to them: "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;" and yet you do not give them food and clothing, what good is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so, faith without works is dead. It is alone and by itself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A man will say: "You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that there is one God. You do well: the demons also believe, and shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Are you willing to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless barrenlifeless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that faith acted with his works, and works made faith perfect complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The scripture was fulfilled which says: "Abraham believed Jehovah and it was reckoned imputedconsideredcredited to him for righteousness." He was called »Jehovahs friend" (Genesis 15:6) ( Isaiah 41:8).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see that a man is justified declared and pronounced righteous by works, and not by faith alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Rahab the harlot was justified by her works. When she received the messengers she sent them out another way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Just as the body without the spirit is dead; even so faith without works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
