Greetings to the twelve tribes that are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Count it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Know that the testing of your faith produces patience endurance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be mature, complete, and lacking in nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If any of you lacks wisdom let him ask of God. He gives to all generously and without reproach and it will be given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>However he must ask in faith, not doubting: for he who doubts is like a surging wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not let that man think that he will receive anything from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A double-minded man is unstable inconsistent in all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let the brother of humble circumstances glory in his high position exaltation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the rich must be glad when God humbles them. This is because they will wither like wildflowers and pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass. The flower falls off and its beauty perishes. So also the rich man will fade away in his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The man who endures under trial is blessed. For when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no man say when he is tempted: "God tempts me." God cannot be tempted with evil, and he tempts enticesteststrys no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his evil desire lust. He is enticed allured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then evil desires, when conceived, give birth to sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above. It comes down from the Father of lights truth and spiritual purity, with whom there is no variation. He does not change like shifting shadows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Using his own will, he gave us birth through the word of truth. This way we would be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know this, my beloved brothers. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of man does not promote the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore get rid of all filthiness and wickedness. Receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, who deceive themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and so continues, being not a hearer who forgets but a doer who works, this man will be blessed in what he does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man thinks he is religious, while he does not control his tongue but deceives his heart, this man's religion is vain worthlessuseless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to care for the fatherless persons and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
