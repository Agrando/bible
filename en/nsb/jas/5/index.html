Their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You stored up your treasure in the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the wages of the laborers who harvested your fields, which are held back by you, cry out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You lived in luxury on the earth, and take your pleasure; you nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned, and you have killed the righteous one. He does not resist you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and late rains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You also be patient. Make your hearts firm, for the coming of the Lord is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not complain utter a deep sigh against one another, that you not be judged. Behold, the judge is standing at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Brothers, accept the example of suffering and patience by the prophets who spoke in the name of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As you know, those who have endured are called blessed. You have heard of the patience perseveranceendurance of Job, and have seen the outcome Jehovah provided, how he was very tender with his affection and mercy. (Psalm 103:8)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Above all things, my brothers do not swear by heaven, or by earth, or by any other oath. Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No. That way you will not fall under judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any among you sick? Let him call the elders of the congregation. Let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The prayer of faith will save the sick person. God will raise him up; and if he committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man helps much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elijah was a man of like passions with us. He prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He prayed again; and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My brothers, if any among you strays from the truth, and one brings him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>let him know, that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a person from death, and cover a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
