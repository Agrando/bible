You know that we will receive a heavier stricter judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>We all stumble in many things. If any do not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to restrain control the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us. We guide their whole bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look at ships. They are large and are driven by rough winds. Yet a very small rudder can control them, wherever the captain wills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The tongue also is a little member. It boasts great things. Consider how great a forest fire a small fire kindles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The tongue is like fire, the place of iniquity among our members. It defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of our life. It is set ablaze like the ever-burning fires in the Valley of Hinnom Greek: Gehenna: symbolic of total destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Every kind of beast and bird, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil. It is full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We bless Jehovah, the Father, with it. (Psalm 34:1) Then we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessing and cursing come out of the same mouth! My brothers, these things should not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine produce figs? Neither can salt water yield sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his works are from meekness because of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you have bitter jealousy envy and greedy ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not a wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and devilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where jealousy and selfishness are, there is confusion and every evil deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, without discord partiality, without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
