Is the cause of fighting your sensual lusts for pleasure that battle within you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You lust, and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain! You fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly with bad motives that you may spend it on your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity hatredhostility toward God? Whoever would be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you think the scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the attitude of the heart mental disposition that he induced to live in us cause us to envy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives more grace. The scripture said, "God resists the proud, but gives grace loving-kindness to the humble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be subject to God! Resist Satan the Devil and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded uncertaindoubterskeptic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves in the presence of God, and he will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Brothers, do not speak against each other. He who speaks against a brother, or judges his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law. If you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Only one is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you that you judge your neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, you that say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and make profit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You do not know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? For you are a vapor puff of air that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You should say, "If God wills, we should both live, and do this or that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You glory in your conceit. Such glory is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He that knows to do good, and does not do it, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
