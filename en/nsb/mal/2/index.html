If you will not listen to what I say, and give glory and honor to my name, I will bring a curse on you. I will put a curse on the things you receive for your support. I have already put a curse on you. Your blessings are cursed already because you do not take my command seriously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I will punish your children and rub your faces in the dung of the animals you sacrifice! You will be taken away with the dung heap of your feasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»You will know I sent this commandment to you! This way my covenant with Levi will continue,« said Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»My covenant was with him Levi. It was of life and peace. I gave them to him that he might reverence me. He respected me and stood in awe of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The law of truth was in his mouth. Unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness. He turned many away from iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The priests should teach the true knowledge of God. They are the messengers of Jehovah of Hosts. Therefore the people should learn my will the law from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You priests have turned away from the right path. Your teaching has led many to do wrong. You have corrupted the covenant I made with Levi you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I caused you to be despised and low before all the people. You are contemptible and do not keep my ways. You show partiality when applying the law.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Do we all have one father? Did one God create us? Why do we deal treacherously with one another? Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The people of Judah have done wrong. They deal treacherously and committed an abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem. Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Jehovah will remove from the community of Israel those who did this. They will never again participate in the national offerings to Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Another thing you do is drown Jehovahs altar with tears, weeping and wailing. This is because he no longer accepts the offerings you bring him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»You ask: Why do you not accept our offerings? It is because Jehovah is a witness between you and the wife of your youth. The one to whom you have been unfaithful! She is your companion, the wife of your marriage vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Did God make you one? Your flesh and spirit belong to him. What does God look for but godly descendants? Do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I hate divorce and he who covers his garment with violence, said Jehovah, the God of Israel. Jehovah of Hosts declares: Guard yourselves and do not deal treacherously.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»You have made Jehovah weary with your words. You ask: How have we wearied him? You say: Every one that does evil is good in Jehovahs sight. You also say: He delights in them. Then you ask: where is the God of justice?« </span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
