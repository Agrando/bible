Before the day passes like the chaff. Before the fierce anger of Jehovah comes upon you. Yes, before the Day of Jehovah's anger comes upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Seek Jehovah all you meek ones of the earth, you who have obeyed his Law! Seek righteousness! Seek meekness that you may be hidden in the Day of Jehovah's anger. Hebrew: ulay-ulay, may-be; Septuagint: »you may be hid.« Hebrew: sathar: concealed, hidden, protected (Zephaniah 1:2) (Amos 5:15)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Gaza will be abandoned. Ashkelon will be a desolate waste. They will drive out Ashdod at high noon. Ekron will be exterminated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines. I will destroy you and you will not be inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The seacoast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and pens for sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah. They will feed their flocks there. They will rest at night in the houses of Ashkelon. Jehovah their God will visit them and gather back the captive ones.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I have heard the reproach of Moab and the taunting by the children of Ammon. They have reproached my people. They behave arrogantly at the border.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Just as I live,« said Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, »Moab will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah. They will be possessions of nettles and salt pits. They will be deserted forever! My people will plunder them and the remnant of my nation will take possession of their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»They will have this instead of their pride. This is because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Jehovah will fill them with fear for he will starve emaciate all the gods of the earth! Men will worship him, each one from his place, even the coastlands of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»You Ethiopians Cushites will be slain by my sword!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»He will stretch out his hand exercise his power against the north, and destroy Assyria. He will make Nineveh a desolation. It will be barren like the desert wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»And herds will lie down in her midst, all the beasts of the nations. The pelican and the porcupine will lodge on the top of her pillars. Their voice will sing hootcroak in the windows. Desolation will be in the thresholds for he will lay bare that which is built with cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»This is the joyous city that dwelled in security. She said in her heart, I am! There is no one else! She has become an object of desolation, a place for wild animals to lie down in. Every one who passes by her will hiss, and wag his hand.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
