She would not accept correction discipline. She did not trust Jehovah and draw close to her God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Her princes rulers within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Her prophets are insolent and treacherous persons. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary! They have done violence to the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah is righteous within her. He will do no wrong. He brings justice to the dawn of the morning. He does not fail! Yet the unjust know no shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I have destroyed nations! Their battlements are completely destroyed! I have made their streets waste so that none pass by. I destroyed the people and the cities so that there is no inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I said, show me respect and receive discipline instructioncorrection! That way she would not loose her dwelling. This is according to all that I have appointed concerning her. But they rose early to corrupt all their deeds.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Wait for me,« said Jehovah, »until the day that I rise up as a witness. I am determined to gather the nations. I will assemble the kingdoms to pour out upon them my indignation, even all my fierce anger! All the earth will be devoured with the fire of my zeal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I will give the peoples a pure language. They may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him united in total agreement and purpose shoulder to shoulder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The daughter of my scattered ones my peoplemy worshippers will bring an offering to me from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»At that time you will no longer be ashamed of your transgression against me. I will remove everyone who is proud and arrogant. You will never again be haughty on my holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I will leave a faithful few, a humble and lowly people with you. They will seek refuge in the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The faithful few remnant in Israel will not do wrong, tell lies, or use their tongues to deceive others. They will feed their sheep and lie down, and there will be no one making trouble for them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion! Shout and sing in triumph, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah has removed his judgments against you. He has turned aside your enemies. The King of Israel, Jehovah, is in your midst! You will fear calamity no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jerusalem will be told in that day: »Do not be afraid, O Zion! Do not loose courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Jehovah your God is with you! He is a mighty one. He will exult over you with joy. He will refresh you with his love. He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts. They came from Jerusalem. The reproach of exile is a burden to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I will deal at that time with all your oppressors. I will save the lame and gather the outcast. I will turn their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»At that time I will bring you in! At that time I will gather you together. I will give you a name honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth! This will happen when I gather back your captive ones before your very eyes,« declares Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
