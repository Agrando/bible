Zephaniah was the son of Cushi, the grandson of Gedaliah, and the great-grandson of Amariah, son of Hezekiah. Jehovah spoke his word in the days of Judah's King Josiah, son of Amon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»I will destroy take awayremoveconsume everything on the face of the earth!« declared Jehovah. (Zephaniah 2:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I will terminate both man and beast. I will put an end to the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea. I will eliminate the sins that make people fall, together with the sinners. I will remove people from the face of the earth,« declared Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I will use my power against Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will destroy followers of Baal in this place. I will remove the names of the pagan idolatrous priests along with my priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I will remove those who bow down to worship the host of heaven on the housetops and those who bow down and swear to Jehovah and yet swear by Malcolm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The same for those who have turned back from following Jehovah, and those who have not sought Jehovah or inquired of Him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be silent before the Sovereign Lord Jehovah! For the day of Jehovah is near! Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice.

You will hear wailing in the newer part of the city and a loud crash from the hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh! The people of Canaan have perished. Those wealthy with silver will be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps. I will punish the men that are satisfied with their wayward lifestyle. They say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good and he will not do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Their wealth will be looted. Their homes will be demolished. They will build houses. However they will not live in them! They will plant vineyards.

They have sinned against Jehovah! Their blood will be poured out like dust and their intestines like manure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the Day of Jehovahs anger ragewrath.
