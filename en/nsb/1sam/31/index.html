When the archers got him in their range, he was badly wounded by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He said to the young man carrying his weapons: »Draw your sword and kill me. That way these godless Philistines will not gloat over me and kill me.« But the young man was too terrified to do it. So Saul took his own sword and threw himself on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The young man saw that Saul was dead.
