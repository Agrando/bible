He took three thousand of Israels best-trained men to search for David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Saul camped by the road at the hill of Hachilah near Jeshimon. David camped in the desert. He discovered that Saul come to the desert after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David sent spies to confirm Sauls arrival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then David went to the place where Saul camped. David saw the place where Saul and Ners son Abner, the commander of the army, were lying. Saul was lying in the camp. The troops were camped around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>David asked Ahimelech the Hittite, and Abishai the brother of Joab: »Who will go to Sauls camp with me?« »I will,« Abishai answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>David and Abishai entered Sauls camp at night. They found Saul sleeping in the center of the camp. His spear was stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the troops were sleeping around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Abishai said to David: »God put your enemy in your power tonight. Let me plunge his own spear through him and pin him to the ground. I will do it with just one blow. I will not have to strike twice!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But David said: »Do not harm him! Jehovah will certainly punish whoever harms his chosen king.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»By the living God Jehovah,« David declared, »I know that Jehovah will kill Saul, either when his time comes to die a natural death or when he dies in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Jehovah forbid that I should try to harm the one Jehovah anointed to be king. Just take his spear and his water jar and go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>David took the spear and the water jar from beside Sauls head. Then he and Abishai left. No one saw it or knew what happened. No one woke up. They were all sound asleep, because Jehovah sent a heavy sleep on them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then David crossed over to the other side of the valley. He went to the top of the hill a great distance away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David shouted to Sauls troops and to Abner: »Abner! Can you hear me?« »Who is calling to the king?« Abner asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>David answered, »Abner, are you the greatest man in Israel? Why are you not protecting your master, the king? Someone entered the camp to kill your master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»You failed in your duty, Abner! I swear by the living God Jehovah all of you deserve to die. You have not protected your master, whom Jehovah made king. Look for the kings spear? Where is the water jar that was near his head?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Saul recognized Davids voice and said: »Is that your voice my son David?« And David said: »It is my voice, my lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He also said: »Why are you my lord pursuing your servant? What have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If Jehovah has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. If it is men, cursed are they before Jehovah. They have driven me out today so that I would have no attachment with the inheritance of Jehovah, saying: Go serve other gods.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of Jehovah. The king of Israel comes to search for a flea. Yet he hunts me down like a partridge on the mountains.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»My servant David,« Saul said, »I have sinned. Come back. I will not harm you again. You valued my life today. I have acted like a fool. I made a terrible mistake.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>David answered: »Here is the kings spear. Have one of your soldiers come and get it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Jehovah put you in my power today. But you are his chosen king. I would not harm you. Jehovah rewards the righteous and faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I valued and saved your life today. I pray that you will value and save my life and that Jehovah will deliver me out of tribulation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Saul said: »David, my son, I pray that Jehovah will bless you and make you successful!« Saul went back home. David also left.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
