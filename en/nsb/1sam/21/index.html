Ahimelech was afraid when he met David. »Why are you alone?« He asked David. »Why is no one with you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The king ordered me to do something, David answered the priest Ahimelech, and he told me: »No one must know anything about this mission I am sending you to do. I have stationed my young men at a certain place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>David added: »What do you have to eat? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The high priest answered David: »I do not have any ordinary bread here. But there is holy bread for the young men if they have not had sexual intercourse today.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>David answered the priest: »Women have been kept away from us as usual when we go on a mission. The young mens bodies are kept holy even on ordinary campaigns. How much more then are their bodies holy today?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The priest gave him holy bread. For he only had the bread of the presence that had been taken from Jehovahs presence and replaced with warm bread that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That same day one of Sauls servants who was obligated to stay in Jehovahs presence was there. His name was Doeg. He was chief herdsman for Sauls shepherds from Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David asked Ahimelech: »Do you have a spear or a sword here? I did not take either my spear or any other weapon because the kings business was urgent.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The high priest answered: »The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Elah Valley, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the priestly ephod. Take it if you want. There is no other weapon here.« David said: »There is none like it. Let me have the sword.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>David kept running from Saul that day until he came to Gath. There he met with King Achish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The officers of King Achish were also there. They asked Achish: »Is David a king back in his own country? Do the Israelites not dance and sing: Saul has killed a thousand enemies; David has killed ten thousand enemies?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>David thought about what they said. It made him afraid of Achish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Right there in front of everyone, he pretended to be insane. He acted confused and scratched up the doors of the town gate. He drooled in his beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Look at him! Achish said to his officers. You can see he is crazy. Why did you bring him to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have enough crazy people without your bringing another one here. Keep him away from my palace!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
