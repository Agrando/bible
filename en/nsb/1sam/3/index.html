Visions from him were rare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Eli was lying down in his usual place. His eyes became dim and he could not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The lamp of God went out in the Temple of Jehovah. Samuel was lying down where the Ark of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehovah called Samuel. He answered: »Here am I.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He ran to Eli and said: »Here I am. You called me?« »I did not call you,« Eli replied. »Go back to bed.« So Samuel went back to bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah called Samuel again. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said: »Here I am. You called me.« Eli responded: »I did not call you, son. Go back to bed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Samuel had no experience with Jehovah, because the word of Jehovah had not yet been revealed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehovah called Samuel a third time. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said: »Here I am. You called me!« Eli realized discerned that Jehovah was calling the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Go, lie down,« Eli told Samuel. When he calls you, say: »Speak Jehovah I am listening.« So Samuel went back to bed in his room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah came and stood there. He called as he had called the other times: »Samuel! Samuel!« Samuel replied: »Speak! Your servant is listening.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah said to Samuel: »I will do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears it tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»On that day I am going to do to Eli and his family everything I said from beginning to end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I told him I would hand down a long lasting judgment against his household because he knew about his sons sin. They were cursing God but he did not restrain them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I have taken an oath concerning Elis family line. No offering or sacrifice will ever be able to make peace for the sins that Elis family committed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Samuel remained in bed until morning. Then he opened the doors of Jehovahs house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Eli called Samuel and said: »Samuel, my son.« »Here I am,« he responded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»What did Jehovah tell you?« He asked. »Please do not hide it from me. May God strike you dead if you hide anything he told you from me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Samuel told Eli everything. Eli replied: »He is Jehovah! He will do what he thinks is right.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Samuel grew up. Jehovah was with him and did not let any of his words go unfulfilled fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew Samuel was Jehovahs appointed prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah continued to appear in Shiloh, since Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Jehovah. And Samuel spoke to all Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
