But Jonathan was very fond of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jonathan told David: »My father Saul is seeking to kill you. Please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I will stand beside my father in the field where you will be. I will speak with my father about you. If I find out anything I will tell you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul. »You should not commit a sin against your servant David,« he said. »He has not sinned against you. He has in fact done some very fine things for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He risked his life and killed the Philistine Goliath. Jehovah gave all Israel a great victory. You rejoiced when you saw it. Why should you sin by shedding Davids innocent blood for no reason?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jonathan convinced Saul, so Saul made a vow in Jehovahs name that he would not kill David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jonathan called to David and told him what Saul said. Then he brought David to Saul. David served in Sauls army just as he had done before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then there was a war with the Philistines. David fought hard and forced them to retreat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>One night, David was in Sauls home, playing the harp for him. Saul sat there with a spear in his hand. The distressing spirit from Jehovah took control of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear. David dodged it, and Sauls spear struck the wall. David escaped from Saul that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saul sent messengers to watch Davids house and kill him in the morning. Michal, Davids wife advised him: »If you do not save yourself tonight, you will be dead tomorrow!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Michal lowered David through a window. He ran away to escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Michal took some idols, laid them in the bed, put a goat-hair blanket at its head, and covered the idols with a garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Saul sent messengers to get David. Michal said: »He is sick.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Saul sent messengers to see David. They said: »Bring him up to me on his bed. I will put him to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The messengers entered. There, on the bed was the household idol with the quilt of goats hair at its head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Saul said to Michal: »Why have you deceived me like this? You let my enemy go. He has escaped!« Michal said to Saul: »He said to me: Let me go! Why should I kill you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>David escaped to Samuel at Ramah. He told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel stayed in Naioth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Saul was told: »David is at Naioth in Ramah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Saul sent messengers to get David. They saw a group of prophets prophesying with their leader Samuel. Gods Spirit came over Sauls messengers so that they also prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Saul heard what happened. So he sent another group of messengers, but they prophesied the same way. He sent a third group of messengers, but the same thing happened to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Finally, Saul left for Ramah himself. He went as far as the deep pit at the town of Secu. He asked: »Where are Samuel and David?« The people answered: »At Prophets Village in Ramah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He went on from there to Naioth in Ramah. The spirit of God came on him and he acted like a prophet. Then he arrived at Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He even took off his clothes as he prophesied in front of Samuel. He lay there naked all day and all night. The saying: »Is Saul one of the prophets?« came from there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
