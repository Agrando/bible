The best thing for me to do is escape to Philistia. Saul will give up looking for me in Israel. Then I will be safe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>David and his six hundred men went over at once to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>David and his men and their families lived with Achish at Gath. David brought his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Word soon reached Saul that David fled to Gath. So he stopped hunting for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>David said to Achish: »If it is all right with you, let me live in one of the outlying towns. Why should I live in the royal city with you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Achish immediately gave him Ziklag. This is why Ziklag still belongs to the kings of Judah today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>David lived in Philistine territory for one year and four months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David and his men raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. Their territory extends from Telaim to Shur and Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>David attacked the territory and left no man or woman alive. He also took sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing and returned to Achish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Achish would ask: »Whom did you raid today?« David would answer: »The south country Negev in Judah, or the south country of the Jerahmeelites, or the south country of the Kenites.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He did not bring a single man or woman back to Gath alive. He thought, they could tell Achish what I really did. This was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Achish trusted David and thought: »Davids people must be furious with him. From now on he will have to take orders from me.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
