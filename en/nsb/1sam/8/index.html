He named his second son Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The sons did not follow their fathers example but turned to dishonest ways of making money. They took bribes and denied people justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>One day the nations elders came to Samuel at Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They said: »You are an old man. You set a good example for your sons. But they have not followed it. Now we want a king to be our leader like all the other nations. Choose one for us!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Samuel was upset to hear the leaders say they wanted a king. So he prayed about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jehovah answered: »Samuel, do everything they want you to do. I am really the one they have rejected as their king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Ever since the day I rescued my people from Egypt, they have turned from me to worship idols. Now they are turning away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Listen to them. But be sure to warn them and tell them about the behavior and rights of a king who rules over them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Samuel told the people who had asked him for a king everything Jehovah said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Samuel said: »These are the rights of a king: He will draft your sons and make them serve on his chariots and horses, and make them run ahead of his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»He will appoint them to be his officers over one thousand or over fifty soldiers. He will have them plow his ground and harvest his crops. He will require them to make weapons and equipment for his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»He will take your daughters from you and force them to make perfumes, cook, and bake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He will take away the best of your fields, vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his officials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»He will take a tenth of your grain and wine and give it to his aids and officials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He will confiscate your male and female slaves, your best cattle, and your donkeys for his own use.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He will take a tenth of your flocks. In addition, you will be his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»You will cry out because of the king whom you have chosen for yourselves. Jehovah will not answer you when that day comes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the people refused to listen to Samuel. They said: »We want a king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»We want to be like other nations, with our own king to rule us and to lead us out to war and to fight our battles.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Samuel listened to everything they said. Then he repeated it to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jehovah answered: »Do what they want. Give them a king.« Then Samuel told all the men of Israel to go back home.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
