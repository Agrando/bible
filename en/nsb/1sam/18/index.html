Jonathan became Davids closest friend. He loved David as much as he loved himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Saul kept him with him that day and would not let him go home to his fathers house any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jonathan made a covenant with David. He loved him as himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing. He gave it to David along with his armor, including his sword, his bow and his belt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So David did everything Saul sent him to do successfully. Saul made him a commander in his army. This pleased the people and Sauls servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>David returned from a campaign against the Philistines. That same day women from all of Israels cities came to meet King Saul. They sang and danced. Tambourines, joyful music, and triangles accompanied them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The women who celebrated sang: »Saul has defeated thousands but David tens of thousands!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Saul became very angry because he considered this saying to be insulting. He said: »To David they credit tens of thousands but to me they credit only a few thousand. The only thing left for David is my kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He was jealous and suspicious of David from that day on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The next day Jehovah let a distressing spirit take control of Saul. He began acting like a crazy man inside his house. David came to play the harp for Saul as usual. This time Saul had a spear in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saul balanced the spear in his hand and said: »I will give David a blow! I will pin him to the wall.« David got away from him twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with David but left Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Saul sent him away. He put him in command of a thousand men. David led his men in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah helped David. He and his soldiers always won their battles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Saul saw how wisely David behaved. This made him fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Everyone in Israel and Judah loved David. He led them in and out of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Finally, Saul said to David: »Here is my oldest daughter Merab. I will give her to you as your wife if you prove yourself to be a warrior for me and fight Jehovahs battles.« Saul thought: »I must not lay a hand on him. Let the Philistines do that.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>David answered: »Who am I? What is my family that I should be the kings son-in-law?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The time came for Merab to be given to David. Instead, she was given to a man named Adriel from Meholah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Sauls daughter Michal fell in love with David. When Saul heard of this he was pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said to himself: »I will give Michal to David. I will use her to trap him. The Philistines will kill him.« So for the second time Saul said to David: »You will be my son-in-law.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Saul ordered his officials to speak to David in private. They went to David and said: »Look, the king likes you, and all of his officials are loyal to you. Why not ask the king if you may marry his daughter Michal?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sauls servants said these things to David. And David said: »I am not rich or famous enough to marry Princess Michal.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Sauls servants told him: »David asked, do you think it is easy to become the kings son-in-law? I am a poor and unimportant person.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the officers told Saul what David had said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Sauls officials reported to David what Saul had said. David was delighted with the thought of becoming the kings son-in-law. Before the day set for the wedding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>David and his men killed two hundred Philistines. He took their foreskins to the king and counted them all out to him. This was so he might become his son-in-law. So Saul had to give his daughter Michal in marriage to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Saul knew she loved David. He also realized that Jehovah was helping David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Knowing those things made Saul even more afraid of David. He was Davids enemy for the rest of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The Philistine rulers kept coming to fight Israel. David always won when he fought them. He won more battles against the Philistines than any of Sauls other officers. This made him famous.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
