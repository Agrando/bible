He kissed him and said: »Jehovah has anointed you to be ruler of his people Israel. You will rule his people. You will save them from all their enemies. This will be the sign that Jehovah has anointed you to be ruler of his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»When you leave me today two men will be at Rachels grave on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will tell you: We have found the donkeys you are looking for. Your father no longer cares about them. Instead he is worried about you. He keeps asking: What can I do to find my son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»You will go from there until you find the oak tree of Tabor. You will see three men going up to God to Bethel. One will have three young goats and another three cakes of bread and another a skin full of wine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»They will say: Peace be with you. They will give you two cakes of bread that you should take from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»After that you will come to Gibeah, the hill of God, where an armed force of the Philistines is stationed. When you come to the town, you will see a band of prophets coming down from the high place with instruments of music before them. They will be acting like prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The Spirit of Jehovah will come upon you with power. You will be acting like a prophet with them, and will be changed into a different person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»When you see these signs be sure to take what is offered to you. For God is with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Go ahead of me to Gilgal. I will come to sacrifice burnt offerings and make fellowship offerings. Wait seven days until I come to tell you what to do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Saul tried to leave Samuel, God changed his mind. That day all these signs happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Saul came to the hill a group of prophets came to meet him. Gods Spirit came over him. He prophesied with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All those who knew him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets. They asked one another: »What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul one of the prophets?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A man from that place asked: »Who is their father?« So it became a proverb: »Is Saul one of the prophets?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he finished prophesying he went to the worship site.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Sauls uncle asked him and his servant: »Where did you go?« Saul answered: »To look for the donkeys. When we could not find them, we went to Samuel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Sauls uncle said: »Please tell me what Samuel said to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He assured us the donkeys had been found,« Saul answered his uncle. But Saul did not tell him what Samuel said about his becoming king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Samuel called the people to come into the presence of Jehovah at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to the Israelites: »This is what Jehovah God of Israel says: I brought Israel out of Egypt and rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and all the kings who were oppressing you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»You have rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and distresses. You said to him: »No! Place a king over us. Now then, stand in front of Jehovah by your tribes and family groups.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward. The tribe of Benjamin was chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by families. The family of Matri Matrites was chosen. Then Saul, the son of Kish, was chosen. They looked for him but could not find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They asked Jehovah again: »Has he arrived here yet?« Jehovah answered: »Hes hiding among the baggage.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They ran and got him from there. He stood among the people and was a head taller than everyone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Samuel asked the people: »Do you see whom Jehovah has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.« Then all the people shouted: »Long live the king!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Samuel explained the laws concerning kingship to the people. He wrote the laws on a scroll, which he placed in front of Jehovah. Then Samuel sent the people back to their homes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Saul also went home to Gibeah. With him went some soldiers whose hearts God had touched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Some good-for-nothing people asked: »How can this man save us?« They despised him and would not bring him presents. He did not respond.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
