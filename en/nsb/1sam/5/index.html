So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the next morning they saw that Dagon had again fallen forward on the ground in front of Jehovahs Ark. Dagons head and his two hands were cut off and were lying on the temples threshold. The rest of Dagons body was intact.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That is why the priests of Dagon and everyone else who enters Dagons temple in Ashdod do not step on the temples threshold, even to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah dealt harshly with the people of Ashdod. He destroyed them by striking the people in the vicinity of Ashdod with tumors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the people of Ashdod realized what was happening, they said: »The Ark of the God of Israel must not stay with us. Their God is dealing harshly with our god Dagon and with us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The people of Ashdod called together the Philistine rulers. »What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?« They asked. The rulers said: »The Ark of the God of Israel must be taken to Gath.« So the people took the Ark of the God of Israel there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After they had moved it, Jehovah threw the city into a great panic. He struck all the people in the city and they were covered with tumors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the people of Gath sent the Ark of God to Ekron. But when the Ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out: »They brought the Ark of the God of Israel here to kill us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The people of Ekron called for another meeting of the Philistine rulers and told them: »Send this chest back where it belongs. Then it will not kill us.« Everyone was in a panic, because God was causing a lot of people to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The survivors suffered from the sores, so they all cried to their gods for help.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
