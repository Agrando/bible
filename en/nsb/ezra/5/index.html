The prophets of God were with them, helping them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>At the same time, Tattenai, ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their men, came to them and said, »Who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then they said these words to them: »What are the names of the men who are at work on this building?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The eye of their God was on the chiefs of the Jews, and they did not make them give up working till the question had been put before Darius and an answer came by letter about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is a copy of the letter Tattenai, the ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai and his friends the Apharsachites, from across the river, sent to Darius the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They sent him a letter saying: »To Darius the king, all peace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»This is to give the king word that we went to the land of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is made of large stones and has its walls supported with wood. The work is going on with diligence and they are making rapid progress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Then we asked the men responsible: Who gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»We requested their names, so that we might send you word, and give you the names of the men in charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Their answer was: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made complete by a great king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»But when our fathers moved the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them up into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the Chaldaean.
