We have been making offerings to him from the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, who sent us here.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of families in Israel said to them: »You have no part with us in the building of a house for our God. We will do the work for Jehovah, the God of Israel, as Cyrus, king of Persia, has given us orders.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and tried to make them afraid to go on building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They hired men to work against them and kept them from accomplishing their plans during the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, till Darius became king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Ahasuerus first became king, they put on record a statement against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the time of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his friends, sent a letter to Artaxerxes, king of Persia, writing it in the Aramaic language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe, sent a letter against Jerusalem, to Artaxerxes the king as follows:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The letter was sent by Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe and their friends; the Dinaites and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites people of Susa, the Dehaites, the Elamites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The rest of the nations the great and noble Osnappar took over and put in Samaria and the rest of the country over the river:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»This is a copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants living across the river send these words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»We give news to the king that the Jews who came from you have come to us at Jerusalem. They are again building that uncontrolled and evil town. The walls are complete and they are repairing the bases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The king may be certain that when the town and its wall are completely rebuilt they will pay no tax or payment in goods or forced payments, and in the end it will be a cause of loss to the kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Because we are responsible to the king, and it is not right for us to see the king's honor damaged, we have sent to give the king word of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»That way a search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will see in the book of the records that this town has been uncontrolled. It has been a cause of trouble to kings and countries. There were outbursts against authority in the past. That is the reason the town was laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»We give you word, that if this town and its walls is completely rebuilt, your power in the country across the river will end.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The king sent an answer to Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe, and their friends living in Samaria, and to the rest of those across the river, saying, »Peace to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The meaning of the letter you sent to us has been made clear to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I gave orders for a search to be made, and it is certain that in the past this town has made trouble for kings, and that outbursts against authority have taken place there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Further, there have been great kings in Jerusalem. They ruled over all the country across the river. Taxes and tribute was paid to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Give an order now that these men are to do no more work and that the building of the town is to be stopped till I give an order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Be sure to do this with all care. Do not let trouble increase to damage the king.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then, after reading the king's letter, Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their friends went quickly to Jerusalem, to the Jews to compel them by force to stop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the work of the house of God at Jerusalem was stopped, till the second year of the rule of Darius, king of Persia.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
