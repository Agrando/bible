We were by nature children of anger and violent passion, like everyone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ. For by grace loving-kindness you have been saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God raised us up with him and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, with Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So in the ages to come he, with Christ Jesus, might show the exceeding surpassingexceptional riches of his grace with kindness toward us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By grace Greek: charis, divine favor, loving-kindness you have been saved through faith. It is not from you. It is the gift from God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It is not the result of works. So no man should boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For we are his workmanship created with Christ Jesus for good works. God prepared these works in advance that we should walk in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Remember that you were once people of the nations in the flesh. You are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision, in the flesh, made by human hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You were separate from Christ at that time, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel. You were strangers from the covenants of the promise. You had no hope and were without God in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You were once far off but now with Christ Jesus, the blood of Christ has brought you near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For he is our peace, who made both Jews and Gentiles one, and broke down the middle barrier of partition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Christ abolished in his flesh the enmity ill will, which the law of commandments contained in ordinances. That way he might create one new man, out of the two, with himself establishing peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So he reconciled them both in one body to God through the stake. He put to death the enmity antagonismhostility.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He came and preached peace to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We both have access to the Father by one Spirit through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then you are no longer strangers and aliens. You are fellow citizens with the holy ones and of the household of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Christ Jesus is the chief corner stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In him each building fits together and grows into a »holy Temple for Jehovah.« (Zechariah 6:12)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In Christ you are assembled together as a place for Gods Spirit to dwell.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
