He was an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling odor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nor should there be filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting but rather giving of thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you know this with certainty, that no fornicator, no unclean person, no covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let no one deceive you with empty words. It is because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not be partakers with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk livebe occupied as children of light</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for the fruit of the light lifespirit consists of all goodness and righteousness and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Learn what is well pleasing to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead reprove exposeconvict them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the things that are done by them in secret is a shame even to speak about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all things become visible when the light exposes them, for everything that becomes visible is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this reason it says: »Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make the most of your time redeem or ransom back time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not be foolish, but understand perceive what the will of Jehovah is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not get drunk with wine, for that is a public act of violence, but be filled with the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Speak to one another in psalms and praise and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Always give thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Be subject obedientsubordinate to one another in reverence of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the congregation, he being the savior of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The congregation is subject to Christ. Likewise let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This is so he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he will be able to present the congregation to himself as a glorious congregation, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. It should be holy and without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In this way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his own wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>No man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also does the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And we are members of his body!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and will stick adherecleavebe joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This secret is great! I speak with regard to Christ and of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Each one of you should love his own wife even as himself. The wife should respect her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
