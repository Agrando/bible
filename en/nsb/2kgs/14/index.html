It was in the second year of Jehoash son of Joahaz king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah. Though not like David his forefather; he did as Joash his father had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Still the high places were not taken away. The people continued making offerings and burning them in the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As soon as he firmly established the kingdom he immediately put to death those servants who had taken the life of his father, the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he did not put their children to death. The orders of Jehovah recorded in the book of the law of Moses say: »The fathers are not to be put to death for the children, or the children for their fathers; but each man shall be put to death for his own sin.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He put to the sword twelve thousand men of Edom in the Valley of Salt. He captured Sela in war, and named it Joktheel, as it is to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Amaziah sent representatives to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: »Come let us have a meeting face to face.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying: »The thorn-tree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon, saying: Give your daughter to my son for a wife. A beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by, crushing the thorn under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»It is true that you have overcome Edom and your heart is uplifted. Let that glory be enough for you and stay in your own country. Why do you make causes for trouble, putting yourself and Judah with you in danger of downfall?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Amaziah paid no attention. So Jehoash king of Israel went to Amaziah king of Judah to meet face to face at Bethshemesh in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Judah was defeated by Israel and every man fled home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehoash king of Israel made Amaziah king of Judah son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, prisoner at Bethshemesh. He went to Jerusalem and had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the Gate of Ephraim to the gate in the angle, six hundred feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He took all the gold and silver and all the vessels in the Temple of Jehovah and in the storehouse of the king, together with those whose lives would be the price of broken faith, and went back to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The rest of the acts of Jehoash, and his power, and how he went to war with Amaziah, king of Judah, are recorded in the Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehoash went to rest with his fathers. They buried him in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Jeroboam his son became king in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, king of Judah, went on living for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The rest of the acts of Amaziah are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Conspiracy was plotted against him in Jerusalem. He went in flight to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They took his body on horseback and buried him with his fathers in Jerusalem, the town of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He was the builder of Elath, which he got back for Judah after the death of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel became king in Samaria. He ruled for forty-one years. This was in the fifteenth year of the rule of Amaziah son of Joash the king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. He did not turn away from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He got back the old limits of Israel from the way into Hamath to the sea of the Arabah. This was what Jehovah said by his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet of Gathhepher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jehovah saw the bitter affliction of Israel. There was no one left, bond or free. There was no help for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jehovah had not said that the name of Israel was to be taken away from the earth. So he gave them a savior in Jeroboam, the son of Joash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all he did, and his power, and how he went to war with Damascus, causing the wrath of Jehovah to be turned away from Israel, are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeroboam went to rest with his fathers. He was buried with the kings of Israel. Zechariah his son became king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
