Take this jar of olive oil with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»When you get there look for Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Take him to a private room away from his companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Pour this olive oil on his head, and say: Jehovah anoints you king of Israel. Then leave there as fast as you can.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The young prophet went to Ramoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He found the army officers in conference. He said: »I have a message for you.« Jehu asked: »Who are you speaking to?« »To you, captain.« He replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The two of them went indoors. The prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu's head and said to him: »Jehovah, the God of Israel, says: I anoint you king of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You are to kill your master the king of the house of Ahab. I am punishing Jezebel for murdering my prophets and my other servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»The entire house of Ahab will perish. I will get rid of every male in his family, young and old alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I will treat his family as I did the families of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and of King Baasha son of Ahijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Jezebel will not be buried. Dogs in the territory of Jezreel will eat her body.« After saying this, the young prophet opened the door and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehu went back to his fellow officers. They asked him: »Is everything all right? What did this mad fellow want with you?« Jehu answered: »You know what he wanted.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»No we do not!« They replied. »Tell us what he said!« They asked. »He told me that Jehovah says: I anoint you king of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At once Jehu's fellow officers spread their cloaks at the top of the steps for Jehu to stand on. They blew trumpets and shouted: »Jehu is king!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, plotted against Joram. Joram and all the army of Israel were keeping watch on Ramoth-gilead against Hazael, king of Aram:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>King Joram went back to Jezreel to recuperate from the wounds he received from the Aramaeans when he fought against Hazael, king of Aram. Jehu said: »If this is your purpose let no one get away to give news of it in Jezreel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jehu got into his carriage and went to Jezreel. Joram was ill in bed there and Ahaziah, king of Judah came to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The watchman on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu and his company coming. He said: »I see a company of people.« Joram said: »Send out a horseman to them and let him ask: Do you come in peace?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So a horseman went out to them and said: »The king asks: Do you come in peace? « Jehu said: »What have you to do with peace? Follow me.« The watchman reported that the horseman reached the group and was returning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A second man was sent out on horseback. He approached them and asked the same thing: »Do you come in peace?« Jehu replied: »What have you to do with peace? Follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The watchman reported: »He went up to them and has not come back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu, son of Nimshi, for he is driving violently.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Joram said: »Get ready.« They prepared his chariot and Joram, king of Israel, with Ahaziah, king of Judah, went out in their chariots to meet Jehu. They came face to face with him at the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When Joram saw Jehu he said: »Do you come in peace, Jehu?« He said in reply: »What peace is possible while all the land is full of the disgusting sins of your mother Jezebel, and her secret arts of witchcraft?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Joram turned his horses and fled. He said to Ahaziah: »Broken faith, O Ahaziah!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and sent an arrow, wounding Joram between the arms. The arrow came out at his heart, and he went down on his face in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehu said to Bidkar, his captain: »Pick him up, and put him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. I remember when you and I were riding together after Ahab, his father. Jehovah offered this prophesy against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Even as I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday, I will pay you back in this field, declares Jehovah. Now take him and throw him into the field as Jehovah predicted.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled on the road leading to Beth Haggan. Jehu pursued him and ordered: »Shoot him down in his chariot.« They shot him at Gur Pass, near Ibleam. Ahaziah continued to flee until he got to Megiddo, where he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>His servants brought him in a chariot to Jerusalem. They buried him in a tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Ahaziah became king over Judah. It was in the eleventh year of the rule of Joram, the son of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jehu went to Jezreel. Jezebel had news of what happened. Painting her eyes and dressing her hair with ornaments, she put her head out of the window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As Jehu entered the town, she said: »Have you come in peace, you Zimri, who killed his master?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then, looking up to the window, he said: »Who is on my side, who?« Two or three eunuchs look out at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said: »Take her and throw her out the window.« So they threw her down with force. Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses. She was crushed under their feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He came in and ate and drank. He said: »Now see to this cursed woman. Bury her body in the earth, for she is a king's daughter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They went to bury her, but they found nothing to bury. There were only the bones of her head, and her feet, and parts of her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So they came back and told him about it. He said: »This is what Jehovah said by his servant Elijah the Tishbite: In the heritage of Jezreel the flesh of Jezebel will become food for dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»The dead body of Jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of Jezreel. They will not be able to say: »This is Jezebel.« «</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
