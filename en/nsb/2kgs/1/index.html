He sent some messengers and said to them: »Go to consult Baalzebub, the god of the Philistine city of Ekron, to find out whether or not I will recover from this.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovahs angel commanded Elijah, the prophet from Tishbe, »Go and meet the messengers of King Ahaziah. Ask them: Why are you going to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Do you think there is no god in Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Tell the king Jehovah says: You will not recover from your injuries. You will in fact die!« Elijah did as Jehovah commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The messengers returned to the king. »Why have you come back?« He asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They answered: »A man told us to come back and tell you that Jehovah says: Why are you sending messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no god in Israel? You will not recover from your injuries. You will die!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»What did the man look like?« The king asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He was a hairy man wearing a cloak made of animal skins, tied with a leather belt,« they answered. »It is Elijah!« The king exclaimed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he sent an officer with fifty men to get Elijah. The officer found him sitting on a hill and said to him: »Man of God, the king orders you to come down.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»If I am a man of God,« Elijah answered: »Let fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men!« At once fire came down and killed the officer and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The king sent another officer with fifty men, who went up and said to Elijah: »Man of God, the king orders you to come down at once!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Since I am a man of God,« Elijah answered: »let fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men!« At once the fire of God came down and killed the officer and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Once more the king sent an officer with fifty men. He went up the hill, fell on his knees in front of Elijah, and pleaded: »Man of God, be merciful to my men and me. Spare our lives!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»The other officers and their men were killed by fire from heaven. Please, please be merciful to me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The angel of Jehovah said to Elijah: »Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.« So Elijah went with the officer to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Elijah spoke to the king: »This is what Jehovah says: Because you sent messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron acting as if there were no god in Israel to consult, you will not get well. You will die!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ahaziah died, just as Jehovah spoke through Elijah. Ahaziah had no sons, so his brother Joram succeeded him as king. This happened in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Everything else that King Ahaziah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
