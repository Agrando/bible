As you know, he was a man who respected God. A man to whom he owed money came to take away my two sons as slaves in payment for my husband's debt.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Elisha said: »Tell me what shall I do for you? What do you have at home?« She answered: »Except for a small jar of olive oil, I have nothing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Ask your neighbors for empty jars. Borrow as many as you can,« Elisha told her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»You and your sons go into the house and shut the door behind you. Pour oil into the jars. Set each one aside as soon as it is full.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The woman went into her house with her sons. They closed the door and took the small jar of olive oil, and poured oil into the jars as her sons brought them to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the jars were full she asked if there were any more. »That was the last one,« one of her sons told her. So the olive oil stopped flowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She returned to Elisha, the prophet. He said: »Sell the olive oil and pay all your debts. There will be enough money left over for you and your sons to pay your living expenses.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Elisha went to Shunem, where a rich woman lived. She invited him to a meal. From that time on every time he went to Shunem he would have his meals at her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She said to her husband: »I know that this man who comes here often is a holy man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Let us build a small room on the roof, and put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp in it. He can stay there when he visits us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>One day Elisha returned to Shunem and went to his room to rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He told his servant Gehazi to call the woman. When she came,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>he said to Gehazi: »Ask her what I can do for her in return for all the trouble she has had in providing for our needs. Maybe she would like me to go to the king or the army commander and put in a good word for her.« »I have all I need here among my own people,« she answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Elisha asked Gehazi: »What can I do for her?« He answered: »She has no son, and her husband is an old man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Tell her to come here,« Elisha ordered. She came and stood in the doorway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Elisha said to her: »By this time next year you will hold a son in your arms.« »Please do not lie to me. You are a man of God!« She said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Just as Elisha said, about that time the following year she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Years later at harvest time, the boy went out one morning to join his father, who was in the field with the harvest workers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Suddenly he cried out to his father: »My head hurts! My head hurts!« »Carry the boy to his mother,« the father said to a servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The servant carried the boy back to his mother. She held him in her lap until noon. Then the boy died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>She carried him up to Elisha's room and put him on the bed. She closed the door behind her and left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>She called her husband and said to him: »Send a servant here with a donkey. I need to go to the prophet Elisha. I will be back as soon as I can.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Why must you go today?« Her husband asked. »It is neither a Sabbath nor a New Moon Festival.« She replied: »Never mind.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>She had the donkey saddled, and ordered the servant: »Make the donkey go as fast as it can. Do not slow down unless I tell you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She left for Mount Carmel, where Elisha was. Elisha saw her coming while she was still far off. He said to his servant Gehazi: »Look, there comes the woman from Shunem!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Hurry to her and find out if everything is all right with her and her family.« She told Gehazi that everything was all right,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but when she came to Elisha, she bowed down before him and took hold of his feet. Gehazi was about to push her away. Elisha said: »Do not bother her. You can see she is deeply distressed. Jehovah has not told me a thing about it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman said to him: »Did I ask you for a son? Did I not tell you not to get my hopes up?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Elisha told Gehazi:« Hurry! Take my walking stick. Do not stop to talk to anyone. If anyone speaks to you do not respond. Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The woman said to Elisha:« I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you! So the two of them started back together. »</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Gehazi went ahead and held Elisha's stick over the child. There was no sound or any other sign of life. He returned to meet Elisha and said: »The boy did not wake up.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When Elisha arrived he went alone into the room. He saw the boy lying dead on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He closed the door and prayed to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then he lay down on the boy, placing his mouth, eyes, and hands on the boy's mouth, eyes, and hands. As he lay stretched out over the boy, the boy's body started to get warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Elisha got up and walked around the room. He returned and again stretched himself over the boy. The boy sneezed seven times and then opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Elisha called Gehazi and told him to call the boy's mother. When she came in, he said to her: »Take your son!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>She fell at Elisha's feet with her face on the ground. Then she took her son and left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When there was a famine throughout the land, Elisha returned to Gilgal. He was teaching a group of prophets. He told his servant to put a big pot on the fire and make some stew for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>One of them went out in the fields to gather herbs. He found a wild vine and picked as many gourds as he could carry. He brought them back and sliced them into the stew, not knowing what they were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The stew was poured out for the men to eat. They tasted it and exclaimed to Elisha: »It is poisoned!« They would not eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Elisha asked for some meal. He threw it into the pot and said: »Pour out some more stew for them.« Then there was nothing wrong with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>A man came from Baal Shalishah. He brought Elisha twenty loaves of bread made from the first barley harvested that year and some freshly cut heads of grain. Elisha told his servant to feed the group of prophets with this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He asked: »How am I to feed a hundred hungry men with this?« Elisha replied: »Give it to them to eat, because Jehovah says that they will eat and still have some left over.« (Matthew 14:20)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So the servant set the food before them. Just as Jehovah said, they ate and had some left over.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
