He ruled in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother's name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah. He walked in the ways of David his father, without turning to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now in the eighteenth year after he became king, Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah son of Meshullam the scribe, to the Temple of Jehovah. He said to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Go to Hilkiah the high priest. Let him count the money brought into the Temple of Jehovah that the keepers of the door gathered from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Let them deliver it to the workmen who have oversight of the work of Jehovahs Temple. Then they can pay it to the workmen who are making good what was damaged in the Temple of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»To the woodworkers and the builders and the stonecutters; and for getting wood and cut stones for building the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Since the workmen are honest, do not require them to account for the money you give them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The chief priest Hilkiah told the scribe Shaphan: »I found the Book of the Law in Jehovahs House.« Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who then read it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The scribe Shaphan reported to the king: »We have taken the money donated in the temple and have given it to the workmen who are in charge of Jehovahs House.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the scribe Shaphan told the king: The priest Hilkiah has given me a book. Shaphan read it to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the king heard what the book of the Law said, he tore his clothes in distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The king gave an order to the priest Hilkiah, to Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, the scribe Shaphan, and the royal official Asaiah. He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Go inquire of Jehovah on my behalf and for the people. This is concerning the words in this book that has been found. Jehovahs fierce anger is directed towards us because our ancestors did not obey the things in this book or do everything written in it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to talk to the prophet Huldah. She was the wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah and grandson of Harhas. Shallum was in charge of the royal wardrobe. Huldah was living in the Second Part of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She told them: »This is what Jehovah God of Israel says: Tell the man who sent you to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is what Jehovah says: »I am going to bring disaster on this place and on the people living here. This is according to everything written in the book that the king of Judah has read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I will do this because they abandoned me. They sacrificed to other gods in order to make me furious. Therefore, my burning anger against this place will never be extinguished.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Huldah added: »Tell Judah's king who sent you to me to ask Jehovah a question. This is what Jehovah God of Israel says about the words you heard:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You had a change of heart and humbled yourself in front of Jehovah when you heard my words against this place and those who live here. I said that those who live here would be destroyed and cursed. You also tore your clothes in distress and cried in front of me. So I will listen to you,« declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»That is why I will bring you to your ancestors. I will bring you to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see any of the disaster I will bring on this place.« « They reported this to the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
