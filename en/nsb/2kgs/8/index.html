It will last for seven years. Leave with your family and go live somewhere else.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>She followed his instructions and left with her family to live in Philistia for the seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When the seven years ended she returned to Israel. She went to the king to ask that her house and her land be restored to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The king was talking with Gehazi, Elisha's servant, when she found him. The king wanted to know about Elisha's miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead person back to life. The woman made her appeal to the king. Gehazi said to him: »Your Majesty, here is the woman and here is her son whom Elisha brought back to life!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She responded to the kings question by confirming Gehazis story. The king called an official and told him to give back to her everything that was hers. This included the value of all the crops that her fields produced during the seven years she was away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Elisha went to Damascus when King Benhadad of Syria was sick. The king was told that Elisha was there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to Hazael, one of his officials: »Take a gift to the prophet and ask him to consult Jehovah to find out whether or not I am going to get well.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Hazael loaded forty camels with all kinds of the finest products of Damascus and went to Elisha. Hazael said: »Your servant, King Benhadad sent me to ask if he will recover from his sickness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Elisha answered: »Jehovah has revealed to me that he will die. However go to him and tell him that he will recover.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Elisha stared at him in horror until Hazael became ill at ease. Suddenly Elisha burst into tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Why are you crying?« Hazael asked. »Because I know the horrible things you will do against the people of Israel,« Elisha answered. »You will burn their fortresses, slaughter their finest young men, batter their children to death, and rip open their pregnant women.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»How could I ever be that powerful?« Hazael asked. »I am nobody, only a dog.« Elisha replied: »Jehovah has revealed to me that you will be king of Syria.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Hazael returned to Benhadad, who asked him: »What did Elisha say?« »He told me that you will certainly get well,« Hazael answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The following day Hazael took a blanket, soaked it in water, and smothered the king. Hazael succeeded Benhadad as king of Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah. It was the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He was thirty-two years old. He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His wife was Ahab's daughter. Like the family of Ahab he followed the evil ways of the kings of Israel. He sinned against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah was not willing to destroy Judah. He promised his servant David that his descendants would always continue to rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Edom revolted against Judah and became an independent kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehoram and his chariots went to Zair. The Edomite army surrounded them. He and his chariot commanders managed to break out and escape. His soldiers scattered to their homes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Edom has been independent of Judah ever since. The city of Libnah also revolted at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Everything Jehoram did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jehoram died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City. His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah. This was in the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He was twenty-two years old. He ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother was Athaliah, the daughter of King Ahab and granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ahaziah was related to King Ahab by marriage. He sinned against Jehovah as Ahab's family did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>King Ahaziah joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria. The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds. Ahaziah went there to visit him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
