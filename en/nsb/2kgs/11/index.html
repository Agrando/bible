She gave orders for all the members of the royal family to be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Only Ahaziah's son Jehoash escaped. He was about to be killed with the others, but was rescued by his aunt Jehosheba, who was King Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's half sister. She hid him and his nurse in a bedroom in the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehosheba took care of the boy and kept him hidden in the Temple for six years. During this time Athaliah ruled as queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In the seventh year Jehoiada the priest sent for the officers in charge of the royal bodyguard and of the palace guards, and told them to come to the Temple. He made them agree under oath to what he planned to do. He showed them King Ahaziah's son Joash</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and gave them the following orders: »When you come on duty on the Sabbath, one third of you are to guard the palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»One third are to stand guard at the Sur Gate. The other third are to stand guard at the gate behind the other guards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The two groups that go off duty on the Sabbath are to stand guard at the Temple to protect the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You are to guard King Jehoash with drawn swords and stay with him wherever he goes. Anyone who comes near you is to be killed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The officers obeyed Jehoiada's instructions and brought their men to him, those going off duty on the Sabbath and those going on duty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He gave the officers the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and had been kept in the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He stationed the men with drawn swords all around the front of the Temple, to protect the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jehoiada led Joash out and placed the crown on his head. He gave him a copy of the laws governing kingship. Then Jehoash was anointed and proclaimed king. The people clapped their hands and shouted: »Long live the king!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Queen Athaliah heard the noise being made by the guards and the people. She hurried to the Temple, where the crowd had gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There she saw the new king standing by the column at the entrance of the Temple, as was the custom. The officers and the trumpeters surrounded him, and the people were all shouting joyfully and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in distress and shouted: »Treason! Treason!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehoiada the priest did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area. He ordered the army officers: »Take her out between the rows of guards, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They seized her and took her to the palace. There at the Horse Gate they killed her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The priest Jehoiada had King Jehoash and the people make a covenant with Jehovah that they would be Jehovahs people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and the idols, and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. Jehoiada put guards on duty at the Temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehoiada the priest, the officers, the royal bodyguard, and the palace guards escorted the king from the Temple to the palace. All the people followed them. Jehoash entered by the Guard Gate and took his place on the royal throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All the people were happy. The city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been killed in the palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
