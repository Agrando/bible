He dressed in sackcloth and went to the Temple of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He sent Eliakim the official in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz. They also were dressed in sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They said to him: »This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day filled with misery, punishment, and disgrace. We are like a woman who is about to give birth but does not have the strength to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The Assyrian emperor sent his chief official to insult the living God. May Jehovah your God hear these insults and punish those who spoke them. So pray to God for those of our people who survive.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>King Hezekiah's men went to Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Isaiah responded to them: »Tell this to your master: This is what Jehovah says: »Do not be afraid of the message you heard when the Assyrian king's assistants slandered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I am going to put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own country. I will have him assassinated in his own country.« «</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The field commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah. He had heard that the king left Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Sennacherib heard that King Tirhakah of Sudan was coming to fight him. Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Tell King Hezekiah of Judah: Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be put under the control of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»You heard what the kings of Assyria did to all countries. They totally destroyed them. Will you be rescued?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Did the gods of the nations that my ancestors destroyed rescue Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Where is the king of Hamath? Where is the king of Arpad? And where is the king of the cities of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Hezekiah read the letters from the messengers. Then he went to Jehovahs Temple and shared them with Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He prayed: »Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, you are enthroned above the angels. You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Turn your ear listenpay attention to me, O Jehovah, and listen. Open your eyes, Jehovah, and see. Listen to the message Sennacherib sent to defy the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»It is true Jehovah. The kings of Assyria have devastated nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»They threw the gods from these countries into fires because these gods are not real gods. They are only wooden and stone statues made by human hands. So the Assyrians have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Rescue us from Assyria's control, O Jehovah our God, so that all the kingdoms on earth will know that you alone are Jehovah God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: »This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: You prayed to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria. I have heard you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»This is Jehovahs message to Sennacherib: My people, the virgin daughter of Zion, despise you and laugh at you. My people in Jerusalem shake their heads behind your back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Whom are you defying and slandering? Against whom are you shouting? Who are you looking at so arrogantly? It is the Holy One of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»You defy Jehovah and through your servants you say: With my many chariots I ride up the high mountains, up the slopes of Lebanon. I cut down its tallest cedars and its finest cypresses. I travel to its most distant borders and its most fertile forests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I will dig wells and drink foreign water. I will dry up all the streams of Egypt with the soles of my feet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Have you not heard? I did this long ago. I planned it in the past. Now I make it happen so that you will turn fortified cities into piles of rubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The inhabitants of these cities are weak, discouraged, and ashamed. They will be like plants in the field, like fresh green grass on the roofs, scorched before it grows up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»I know when you get up and sit down. I know when you go out and come in. I know how you rage against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Since you rage against me and you boast in my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your mouth. I will make you go back the way you came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»This will be a sign for you, Hezekiah: You will eat what grows by itself this year and next year. But in the third year you will plant and harvest, plant vineyards, and eat what is produced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»The remnant in Judah who survives will flourish like plants that send roots deep into the ground and produce fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»There will be a remnant of people in Jerusalem and on Mount Zion who will survive. Jehovah is determined to make this happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»This is what Jehovah said about the Assyrian king: He will not enter this city or shoot a single arrow against it. No soldiers with shields will come near the city. No siege mounds will be built around it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»He will go back by the same road he came. He will not enter the city. I, Jehovah, have spoken!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I will defend this city and protect it. It is for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It happened that night. Jehovahs angel killed one hundred and eighty five thousand soldiers in the Assyrian camp. The next morning the Judeans saw all the corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>King Sennacherib of Assyria returned to his home at Nineveh and stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>While he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer assassinated him. They escaped to the land of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded him as king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
