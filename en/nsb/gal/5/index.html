Stand fast therefore, and do not become entangled again in a yoke of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Behold, I Paul say to you, that, if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision. He is under obligation to obey the whole Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You who seek to be righteous by Law are separated from Christ. You have fallen away from grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision means anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You were running well! Who hindered you that you should not obey the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This persuasion did not come from him who calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little leaven, leavens ferments the whole lump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view. And he that troubles you will bear his judgment, who ever he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then has the stumbling block of the stake been done away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you brothers, were called for freedom; only do not use your freedom for an occasion to the flesh. Serve one another through love!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you continue to bite and devour one another, take care that you do not consume one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. These are in opposition to one another that you may not do the things that you would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if the Spirit leads you, you are not under the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh sinful human nature are apparent. They are: fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, wrath, contentions, divisions, sects,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envies, drunkenness, revelries, and things like these. I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that those who practice such things would not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>meekness mildness, self-control; against such there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have impaled the flesh with its passions and lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
