It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was openly presented impaled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law, or by having faith in what you heard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are you so foolish? After starting in the Spirit, are you now made perfect mature in the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Did you suffer so many things in vain? Does it have no purpose?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He that provides the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Abraham believed God and »Jehovah considered his faith as his righteousness.« (Genesis 15:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You know that those who have faith are sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Scripture revealed ahead of time, that God justified the people of the nations by faith. He preached the good news beforehand to Abraham. He said: »In you will all the nations be blessed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then those who have faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those who are of the works of the Law are under a curse. For it is written, »Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the Law, by obeying them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The fact that the Law justifies no man before God is evident. The righteous will live by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Law is not based on faith. »He that does them will live by them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. It is written; »Cursed is everyone who is hung on a stake.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This way the blessing of Abraham might come upon the nations through Christ Jesus and we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brothers, I speak like a man speaks: Though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He did not say to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now this I say: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the inheritance is based on the Law, it is no longer based on a promise. However God granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What then is the law? It was added to cause awareness of sin because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the Law then against the promises of God? God forbid! If a law had been given which could impart life, righteousness would have been from the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Scriptures shut up imprisonedpictured all things mankind under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came the Law held us in custody. We were locked up until faith was revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Law was our schoolmaster Greek: paedagogue: a combination of schoolmaster, instructor, servant and guardian in charge of us to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you who were baptized into Christ put on clothed yourselves with Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one united in Christ Jesus. (John 17:21) (Ephesians 4:4-6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
