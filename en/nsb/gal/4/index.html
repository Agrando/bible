We were slaves to the arrangement of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the full time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Because you are sons, God sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So you are no longer slaves but a son. And as a son God has made you an heir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>However at that time, you did not know God. You were in bondage to things that are really not gods at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and poor fundamental things? Do you want to slave for them all over again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You observe days and months, seasons and years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I fear for you, that I have labored for you to no purpose and failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also used to be as you are. You did me no wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the good news to you the first time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you did not despise or reject. You received me like an angel messenger of God, even like Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where then is your positive attitude? I bear you witness, that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously eagerly seek you in no good way. They desire to shut you out, that you may seek them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, of whom I am again in labor pains until Christ is formed in you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I wish to be present with you now, and to speak in a different way, for I am perplexed about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you that desire to be under the Law; do you not hear the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman, and one by the freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How is it that the son by the slave woman is born after the flesh; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This contains an allegory symbolic drama. These women symbolize two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She corresponds to the Jerusalem that now is. She is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The Jerusalem above is free. She is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is written, »Rejoice, barren woman who does not give birth. Break forth and cry, you who do not labor; for there are more children of the desolate than of the one who has the husband.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Brothers, we are children who belong to the promise, the same as Isaac was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Just like then, the son who was conceived in a natural way according to the flesh persecuted the son conceived in a spiritual way. That is exactly what is happening now!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What do the scriptures say? »Throw out the slave woman and her son. For the son of the slave woman must not share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.« (Genesis 21:10)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Brothers, we are not children of a slave woman but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
