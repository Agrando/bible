This is according to the will of our God and Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>To him is glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am amazed that you so quickly turned away from the One who called you by the grace of Christ. You turned to different good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet this is not another good news. But there are some who trouble agitate you, and they would pervert the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any message other than that which we preached to you, let him be accursed condemnedexpelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We said before and now I say again, if any man preaches to you any message other than what you received, let him be accursed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do I now seek the favor of men, or of God? Am I striving to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I make known to you brothers that the good news that was preached by me is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I did not receive it from man. I was not taught it! It came to me through revelation from Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You heard about the way I lived as a Jew. How I persecuted the congregation of God beyond measure. In fact I tried to destroy it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I advanced as a Jew beyond many of my own age among my countrymen. I was more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It pleased God to separate me even from my mothers womb and call me through his grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He revealed his Son to me that I might preach him among the nations. I do not confer with flesh and blood human beings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I did not go to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before I was. I went away to Arabia and again I returned to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and waited with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>What I write is true. God knows I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I was still unknown by face to the congregations of Judea that are in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They heard it said: »He that once persecuted us now preaches the faith he once tried to destroy.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They glorified God because of me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
