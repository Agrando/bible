But you must do it in a gentle way. And keep an eye on yourselves, so that you will not be tempted, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So if any one of you thinks you are important when you really are not, you are only fooling yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Each of you must examine your own actions. Then you can be proud of your own accomplishments without comparing yourself to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For each person should carry his own load.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But let him that is orally taught in the word share all good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not be deceived. God is not mocked! A man will harvest what he sows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that sows to his own flesh will harvest corruption of the flesh. But he that sows to the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let us not grow tired of doing good things for in due season we shall harvest, if we do not faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those who desire to make a showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised. This is done so they may not be persecuted for the stake of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For not even those who receive circumcision obey the Law. They desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Never should I boast except in the stake symbolic: self-denial and atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is through this stake that the world has been impaled to me, and I to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision anything, but a new creature is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Israel of God will have peace and mercy. All who walk by this rule will also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let no one trouble me. I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The grace Greek: charis, divine favor, loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Greek: pneuma, mental outlook, attitude, brothers. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
