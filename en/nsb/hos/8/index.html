The enemy swoops down on Jehovahs Temple like an eagle. The people of Israel have rejected my covenant promise and rebelled against my Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Israel cries out to me: We know you as our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»However, they have rejected what is good. The enemy will pursue them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»They chose their own kings. I did not approve. They chose their own princes. Princes I did not know. They made idols with their own silver and gold. Because of this, they will be destroyed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Get rid of your calf-shaped idol, Samaria. My anger burns against these people! How long will they remain unclean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Samaria's calf-shaped idol was made in Israel. Skilled workers made it. It is not God. It will be smashed to pieces!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The people of Israel plant the wind, but they harvest a storm. A field of grain that does not ripen will never produce any grain. Even if it did produce grain, foreigners would eat it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Israel is swallowed up. It has already mixed in with the other nations. It has become worthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The people of Israel went to Assyria. They were like wild donkeys wandering off alone. The people of Ephraim sold themselves to their lovers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Even though they sold themselves among the nations, I will gather them now. They will suffer for a while under the burdens of kings and princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The more altars that the people of Ephraim build to make offerings to pay for their sins, the more places they have for sinning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I have written many rules for them in my Law, but they consider these things strange and foreign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»They offer sacrifices to me and eat the meat of sacrifices, but I, Jehovah, do not accept these sacrifices. Now I will remember their wickedness and punish them because of their sins. They will go back to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»The people of Israel have built palaces, and they have forgotten their maker. The people of Judah have built many fortified cities. I will send a fire on their cities and burn down their palaces.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
