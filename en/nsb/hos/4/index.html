For Jehovah has a legal case against the inhabitants of the land. There is no truth! There is no goodness. There is no knowledge of God in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They do nothing but swear, deceive, kill, steal and commit adultery! There is violence and bloodshed in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore the land will mourn. All the inhabitants are weak. The beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea will also perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let no man find fault and let no man reprove. After all your people are the ones who debate argue with a priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You will stumble in the day, and the prophet will stumble with you in the night. I will destroy your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you! You will not be a priest to me since you have forgotten the Law of your God. Therefore, I will forget your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They grew in number and sinned against me. I will change their glory into shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They feed on the sins of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It will be like people, like the priests. I will punish them for their ways, and will repay them for their actions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They will eat, and not have enough! They will play the harlot, and will not increase! They do not listen to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Prostitution, wine and new wine take away the understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares to them; for the spirit of adultery caused them to go astray. They have played the harlot, departing from their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains! They burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars storax and the strong tree, because it has good shade. Your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery. The men go out with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes. The people that do not understand will fall be overthrown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though you, Israel, play the harlot, do not let Judah become guilty! Do not go to Gilgal, neither go to Bethaven, nor swear, »As Jehovah lives.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Israel behaved stubbornly like a stubborn heifer. Will Jehovah now feed them as a lamb in a large place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ephraim is joined to idols. Leave him alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their drink wheat beer has become sour. They play the harlot continually. Her rulers dearly love shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The wind wrapped her up in its wings. They will be put to shame because of their sacrifices!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
