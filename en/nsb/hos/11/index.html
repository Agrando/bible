They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»It was I who taught Ephraim to walk. I took them in my arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. I lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Swords will flash in their cities, destroy the bars of their gates, and put an end to their plans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»My people are determined to turn apostatize from me. Even if they call to the Most High, he will by no means exalt them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is changed within me. All my compassion is aroused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I will not carry out my fierce anger. I will not turn and devastate Ephraim. I am not man. I am God, the Holy One among you. I will not come against my city in wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»They will follow Jehovah! He will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria. I will settle them in their homes,« declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Ephraim surrounds me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit. Yet Judah is unruly against God, even against the Holy One who is faithful.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
