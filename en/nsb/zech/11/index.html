Wail you oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest has come down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Listen to the wailing of the shepherds! Their glory is destroyed! Listen to the roaring of young lions! The pride of the Jordan is laid waste.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehovah my God said: »Feed the flock doomed to slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Their owners slay them and claim they are not guilty. They that sell them say: Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich and their own shepherds do not pity them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land,« said Jehovah. »I will deliver every one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king. They will strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»So I fed the poor of the flock of slaughter. I took two staffs; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»And I eliminated the three shepherds in one month. I was tired of them, and they also abhorred me found me repugnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Then I said, I will not feed you! If you die go ahead and die. Let those that are left eat each other!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I took my staff, Beauty, and broke it in pieces that I might break my covenant that I had made with all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It was broken in that day. In this way, the poor of the flock listened to me and knew that it was the word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I said to them, »If it is good in your sight give me my wages, if not forget it.« So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah said to me, »Throw it to the potter,« the amount they paid me. I took the thirty pieces of silver, and threw them to the potter, in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I broke my other staff in pieces. It was the one I called Bands. That way I broke the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah said: »Take yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Warning! I will allow a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are perishing, and will not seek those that are scattered. This shepherd will not heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is hungry. He will eat the flesh of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaves the flock! The sword will be upon his arm, and upon his right eye. His arm will be withered and dried up, and his right eye will be blind.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
