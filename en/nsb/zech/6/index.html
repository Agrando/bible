They came out from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of copper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then I asked the angel: »What are these, my lord?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The angel answered: »These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The chariot with the black horses goes toward the North Country. The white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the South Country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The strong ones went forth, and sought to go that they might inspect the earth.« He said: »Go inspect the earth. Search back and forth through out the earth.« So they inspected the earth. They searched back and forth through out the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he cried out to me: »Behold! Those who go toward the North Country have quieted my spirit of anger in the North Country.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The word of Jehovah continued to come to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Take them into captivity, even Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah. The same day go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. They came from Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Take silver and gold and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Say to him: Jehovah of Hosts says, »See here, the man whose name is the Branch SproutShootBud. For he will branch out sprout from where he is and he will build the Temple of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Yes, he will build the Temple of Jehovah. He will receive the glory, and will sit and rule upon his throne. He will be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»And the crowns will be given to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah. This will be for a memorial in the Temple of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Those who are far off will come and build in the Temple of Jehovah.« You will know that Jehovah of Hosts sent me to you. This will come to pass if you will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
