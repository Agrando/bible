A Day of Jehovah comes, when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»I will gather all nations to battle against Jerusalem! The city will be defeated. The houses will be plundered and the women raped! Half of the city will be taken into captivity. The remainder of the people will not be removed from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Then Jehovah will go forth and fight against those nations. It will be just as when he fought in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»His feet will stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east. The Mount of Olives will be split in half toward the east and toward the west. There will be a very large valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»You will flee by the valley of my mountains. For the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel. Yes you will flee the same as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.

Jehovah will be the only one and his name will be the only one in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be lifted up, and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»People will live there and there will be no more curses. Jerusalem will dwell safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The plague will be that Jehovah will strike all the peoples that have gone to war against Jerusalem! Their flesh will wither away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes will wither away in their sockets, and their tongue will wither away in their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»It will happen! A great tumult troubledisturbance from Jehovah will fall on them. Everyone of them will lay hold on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor neighbor will fight against neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Judah will also fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the nations round about will be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»This will be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the donkey, and of all the beasts that will be in those camps, as that plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of Hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»There will be no rain on those who do not go to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»If the family of Egypt does not go it will not be upon them. There will be the plague and Jehovah will strike the nations that do not go to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that do not keep the Feast of Tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»In that day it will be on the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH. And the pots in Jehovah's house will be like the bowls before the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Jehovah of Hosts!
