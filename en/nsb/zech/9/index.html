The eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Hamath and all that borders on it, including Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Tyre built herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Behold! Jehovah will evict her, and he will strike her power in the sea; and she will be devoured with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Ashkelon will see it and fear! Gaza will be pained and Ekron will be put to shame. The king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»An illegitimate son will dwell in Ashdod. I will remove the arrogance of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»And I will remove his blood from his mouth, and his detestable things from between his teeth. He will remain for our God. He will be like a chieftain in Judah, and in Ekron like a Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I will encamp about my house against the army. None will pass through or return. No oppressor will pass through them any more: for now I have seen with my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king comes to you! He is righteous having salvation. He is humble, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the son of a she ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I will destroy the war chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem. The battle bow will be dismantled. He will speak peace to the nations! His dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. This is because of the blood of your covenant!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Return to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope. I declare today: I shall repay you a double portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I bend as my bow, Judah. I filled the bow with Ephraim! I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece. I will make you like the sword of a mighty man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Jehovah will be seen over them. His arrow will go forth like lightning! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet and will go with windstorms of the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Jehovah of Hosts will defend them! They will devour and trample on the sling stones. They will drink and be boisterous with the wine. They will be filled like the sacrificial basins by the corners of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Jehovah their God will save them in that day like the flock of his people. They will be like the stones in a crown lifted high over his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»How great is his goodness! How great is his beauty! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
