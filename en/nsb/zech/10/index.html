It is Jehovah who makes storm clouds and lightning. He will give showers of rain for the vegetation in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie. They have told false dreams! They comfort in vain. They go their way like sheep. They are afflicted because there is no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I am angry with the shepherds! I will punish the male goats. Jehovah of Hosts visited his flock, the house of Judah. He will make them as his majestic horse in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The corner stone will come from them. The tent peg will come from them. Every ruler and the battle bow will come from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They will be as mighty men treading down their enemies in the mire of the streets.

I have redeemed them and they will increase the same as they have increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>« I will sow them among the peoples! They will remember me in far countries. They will live with their children and return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I will once again bring them out of the land of Egypt. I will gather them out of Assyria. I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon and a place will not be found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>« He will pass through the sea of affliction and will strike the waves in the sea. The depths of the Nile will dry up; and the pride of Assyria will be removed and the scepter of Egypt will depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I will strengthen them in Jehovah and they will walk in his name,« declared Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
