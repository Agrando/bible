That way, he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The hard-working farmer should be first to receive his share of the crops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remember that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. He is a descendant of David, according to my good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal. But the word of God is not imprisoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is a faithful saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If we endure, we will also reign with Him. If we deny him, He will deny us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to argue about words. This is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Be diligent to be presented approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But avoid worldly and empty discussion, for it will lead to further ungodliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This kind of talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>These men have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The foundation of God stands firm having this seal: »Jehovah knows those who belong to him,« and: »Everyone who names the name of Jehovah is to abstain from wickedness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, with those who call on the Lord with a clean heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing they produce quarrels controversyfighting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Lords servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind gentle to all, able to teach, and patient when wronged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He should instruct those who oppose using meekness. Perhaps God will give them repentance that they may know the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They should come to their senses out of the snare of the Devil. He has taken them captive and they do his will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
