He did not even consider it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He emptied humbled himself by taking the form of a servant. He was made in the likeness of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He obtained the appearance as a man, humbled himself, and became obedient even to death, yes, death on the stake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this reason God highly exalted him, and gave to him the name that is above every name, Relative authority given by Jehovah God, the Father to His Son (Philipians 2:11)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My beloved, you have always obeyed, not just in my presence, but now much more in my absence.
