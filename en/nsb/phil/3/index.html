To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not a bother, but for you it is a safeguard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beware of the dogs impure menfalse teachers! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilation of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We are those with true circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God. We glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I have more!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I was circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Things that offered gain to me I count a loss for Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I count all things to be loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. I suffered the loss of all things. Yet I count them as refuse garbagedung that I may gain Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I want to be united with him. I no longer want a righteousness of my own that is gained by obeying the law. The righteousness from God is by faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I want to know him and the power of his resurrection. I want to know the fellowship of his sufferings and become conformed to his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I wish to attain to the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect. But I press on, that I may obtain that for which Christ Jesus also obtained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Brothers, I could not yet have obtained it. But one thing I do, I forget the things that are behind, and stretch forward to the things that are ahead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I press on toward the goal to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let those of us who are mature have this attitude. If you have a different attitude God will show you how to think.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>However, we should be guided by what we have learned so far.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Brothers, be imitators of me. Pay attention to those who live by the example we have given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Many live as enemies of the stake of Christ. I often wept as I told you about them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Their end is destruction. Their god is their belly. Their glory is in their shame. They set their mind on earthly things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>However, our citizenship is in heaven. We also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Christ will, through his power, bring everything under his authority. He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorified glorious body literally and figuratively: body of his glory. He is able to subject all things to himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
