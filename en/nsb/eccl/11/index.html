You do not know what calamity will be upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If the clouds are full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth. If the tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He who observes the wind will not sow and he that regards the clouds will not reap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You do not know what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones grow in the womb of a pregnant woman. Even so you do not know the works of God who creates all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the morning sow your seed. In the evening do not withhold your hand. For you do not know which shall prosper. Whether they both will alike be good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Truly the light is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness for they will be many.

Walk in the ways of your heart, and in the desires of your eyes. Yet you know that God will bring you into judgment for all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh, for childhood and youth are vanity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
