You will say: »I have no pleasure in them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Before the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are darkened, or the clouds return after the rain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the day when the keepers of the house will tremble, and the strong men will bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows are darkened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the doors will be shut in the streets. When the sound of the grinding is low he will rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music will be brought low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also when they will be afraid of what is high, and fears will be in the way, and the almond tree will flourish, and the grasshopper will be a burden, and the caper berry breaks and desire fails, man goes to his long lasting home and the mourners go about the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the silver cord is snapped apart, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the dust will return to the earth as it was. The spirit life will return to God who gave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Vanity of vanities,« says the preacher; »all is vanity.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. He gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The preacher sought to find out acceptable words. That which was written was upright, even words of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The words of the wise are like prodding goads, and like nails fastened by the masters of assemblies. They are given from one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>By these, my son, be admonished! There is no end to publishing many books. Also much study is a weariness of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Respect God, and obey his commandments for this is the whole duty of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For God will bring every work into judgment with every secret thing, whether it is good or whether it is evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
