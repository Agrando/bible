There is a time for every purpose under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There is a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pull up what is planted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>a time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>a time to get and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to throw away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There is a time to tear and a time to sew, a time to keep silence and a time to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There is also a time to love and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What profit is there to the worker in his work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have seen the task that God has given with which the sons of men are occupied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made everything appropriate beautifulgood in its time. God placed eternity in the heart of man. For man is unable to see the works of God from the first to the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I am certain that there is nothing better for a man than to rejoice and to do good works in life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor. It is the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know that whatever God does it will be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it. God does it in order that men should reverence respect him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That which is has already been and that which is to be has already been. God seeks what has passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I saw under the sun the place of judgment and wickedness was there. And wickedness was in the place of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I said in my heart, »God should judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time for every purpose and for every work.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I said in my heart concerning the condition of the sons of men, »God tested them that they might see that they are like animals.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What happens to the sons of men also happens to animals. As the one dies so the other dies. Yes, they all have one breath so that a man has no advantage over animals. For all is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All go to one place. All came from the dust and all return to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who knows the breath of man that goes upward, and the breath of the animal that goes downward to the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I see there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works. That is his portion. Who will bring him to see what will happen after him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
