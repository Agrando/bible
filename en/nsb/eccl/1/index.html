It whirls around continually and the wind returns on its circuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full. The rivers return to the place where they began.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All things are wearisome, man is not able to tell. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That which has been is that which will be. That which has been done is that which will be done. There is nothing new under the sun!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Is there anything of which it may be said: »See, this is new?« It has already existed in days of old, which were before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is no memory of former things. Those who follow will not remember those who are yet to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I devoted myself to study and explored wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens. It is a grievous task God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun. Behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is crooked cannot be made straight. What is lacking cannot be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I said to my heart, »I have become great and have aquired more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has seen an abundance of wisdom and knowledge.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I know that this also is a striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In much wisdom there is much grief for he who increases knowledge increases pain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
