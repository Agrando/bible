Yet God has not empowered him to partake of them for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A man can have a hundred children and live many years. If he does not enjoy prosperity and have a decent burial, a stillborn child is better off then he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he comes in with vanity and departs in darkness, and his name will be covered with darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Moreover he has not seen the sun nor known anything.
