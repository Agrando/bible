It is better to go there and listen than to bring the sacrifices fools bring. Fools are not aware that they do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Do not be in a hurry to talk. Do not be eager to speak in the presence of God. Since God is in heaven and you are on earth, limit the number of your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Dreams come with many efforts, trials and concerns. Fools speak with too many words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do not be late in paying a vow you make to God. He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not let your speech cause you to sin. Do not say to the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry because of what you say and destroy the work of your hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There is futility and emptiness in many dreams and in many words. Reverence God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the country, do not be shocked at the sight. One official watches over another official and there are higher officials over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth, with gain. This too is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to see them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sleep of the workingman is pleasant, whether he eats little or much. However the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have seen a grievous evil under the sun. I have seen riches being hoarded by their owner to his downfall distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he fathered a son, then there was no support for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We entered this world with nothing and naked and we will leave this world with nothing and naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This also is a serious evil. Just as we came we will go. Whatever profit or gain we earned we loose as if we labored for the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All his days he eats in darkness. He has much sorrow and anger with his sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This is what I have seen. It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink and enjoy the good of his labor. He labors under the sun all the days of his life. For God gives this to him as his allotment inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has empowered him to eat because of them. He should receive his reward and rejoice in his labor. This is the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He will not often remember the years of his life. This is because God keeps him occupied with the gladness pleasure of his heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
