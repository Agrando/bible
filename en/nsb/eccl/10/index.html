A little foolishness does the same for the one with a reputation for wisdom and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A wise man's heart is at his right hand and a fool's heart at his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When he who is a fool walks along the path, his wisdom fails him, and he says to every one that he is a fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If the temper of the ruler rises up against you do not withdraw from him for gentleness can put a stop to great offenses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun. It is like an error that proceeds from the ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Craziness is set in many exalted places, and the rich sit in low places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that digs a pit will fall into it. A serpent will bite whoever breaks through a hedge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whoever removes landmark stones will be hurt. They will endanger the one who cuts down trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If the ax is dull, and he does not whet the edge, he must put forth more effort. Wisdom helps him to succeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment. A slanderer is no better than an uncharmed snake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness. The result of his talk is mischievous madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A fool also is full of words. A man cannot predict what will be and what will be after him. Who can tell him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The labor of the foolish wearies everyone of them, because he does not know how to go to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child and your princes eat in the morning!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You are blessed, O land, when your king is the son of nobles and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By indolence the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house collapses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A feast is made for laughter and wine makes merry, but money answers all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not curse the king, no not even in thought. Do not curse the rich in your bedchamber for a bird of the air will carry the voice, and that which has wings will tell the matter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
