The devastators have emptied them out and destroyed their vine-branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are dressed in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress tree spears are brandished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The chariots wildly race through the streets. They rush to and fro in the broad ways. They look like torches and they run like lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He remembers his majestic ones. They stumble as they march. They hurry to the wall to prepare the barricade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The gates of the rivers are opened and the palace is dissolved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It is decreed: she is uncovered!

The hearts melt and the knees knock together. There is pain in all the hips and their faces have all grown pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Where is the lions den, the feeding-place of young lions? Where have the lion and the lioness walked where none have made them afraid?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses. He filled his caves and dens with prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I am against you,« said Jehovah of Hosts! »I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will destroy your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers will be heard no more.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
