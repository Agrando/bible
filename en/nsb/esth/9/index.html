Everyone had to give way before them. All the people feared them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the king's business supported the Jews because the fear of Mordecai had come on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Mordecai was great in the king's house. Word about him went out through every part of the kingdom: for the man Mordecai became greater and greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the Jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction, and did to their enemies whatever they had a desire to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Jews put to death five hundred men in Shushan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They put to death Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the hater of the Jews; but they put not a hand on any of their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>On that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of Shushan was given to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The king said to Esther the queen: »The Jews have put five hundred men to death in Shushan, as well as the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the kingdom! Now what is your petition? For it will be given to you. What other request have you? And it will be done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Esther said: »If it is the king's pleasure, let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today, and let orders be given for the hanging of Haman's ten sons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The king said that this was to be done, and the order was given out in Shushan. The hanging of Haman's ten sons was carried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews who were in Shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death three hundred men in Shushan. They did not take their material goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The other Jews in every division of the kingdom came together, fighting for their lives, and got salvation from their enemies and put seventy-five thousand of them to death. They did not put a hand on their material goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This they did on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews in Shushan came together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month. On the fifteenth day they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the Jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day, a day for sending offerings one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, near and far.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He ordered them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same month, every year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As days on which the Jews had rest from their haters, and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy, and from weeping to a good day: and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy, of sending offerings to one another and good things to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as Mordecai had given them orders in writing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the hater of all the Jews, conspired for their destruction, attempting to get a decision by Pur that is, chance with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the business was put before the king, he gave orders by letters that the evil design that he had made against the Jews was to be turned against him. That he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So these days were named Purim, after the name of Pur. And so, because of the words of this letter, and of what they had seen in connection with this business, and what had come to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The Jews made a rule and established a custom that all their descendents should observe two days every year as ordered in the letter, at the fixed time every year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family, in every division of the kingdom and every town, that there might never be a time when these days of Purim would not be kept among the Jews, or when the memory of them would go from the minds of their descendents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Esther the queen, daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the Purim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He sent letters to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with true words of peace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Giving the force of law to these days of Purim at their fixed times, as they had been ordered by Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen. This was in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their descendents, in connection with their time of going without food and their cry for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The order given by Esther gave the force of law to the rules about the Purim. It was recorded in the book.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
