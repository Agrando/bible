He sent for the books of the records and had some one was read them to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>It was recorded in the book how Mordecai had given word of the designs of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's servants, keepers of the gate who conspired to kill the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The king said: »What honor and reward have been given to Mordecai for this?« The servants waiting on the king said: »Nothing has been done for him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The king asked: »Who is in the outer room?« Haman came into the outer room to get the king's authority for the hanging of Mordecai on the pillar that he made ready for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The king's servants said: »Haman is waiting in the outer room.« The king said: »Let him come in.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Haman came in. And the king said to him: »What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring?« Then the thought came into Haman's mind, whom, more than myself, would the king have pleasure in honoring?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Haman answered: »For the man whom the king has delight in honoring,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Let them take the robes that the king generally puts on, and the horse on which the king goes, and the crown that is on his head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»And let the robes and the horse be given to one of the king's most noble captains, so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honoring. Let him go on horseback through the streets of the town, with men crying out before him. So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king said to Haman: »Go quickly, and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who is seated at the king's gate. See that you do everything as you have said.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Haman took the robes and the horse, and dressing Mordecai in the robes, he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town, crying out before him: »So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Mordecai came back to the king's gate. But Haman went quickly back to his house, sad and with his head covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Haman gave his wife Zeresh and all his friends an account of what took place. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, »If Mordecai, who is starting to get the better of you, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not be able to do anything against him, but you will certainly go down before him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>While they were still talking, the king's servants came to take Haman to the feast that Esther made ready.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
