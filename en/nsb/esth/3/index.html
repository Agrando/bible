But Mordecai did not go down before him or give him honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the king's servants in the king's house said to Mordecai, »Why do you go against the king's order?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now when they repeatedly said this to him day after day and he gave no attention, they told Haman about it. To see if Mordecai's behavior would be overlooked: for he said to them that he was a Jew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Haman saw that Mordecai did not go before him and give him honor. Haman was very angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it was not enough for him to attack Mordecai only. They made clear to him who Mordecai's people were. So Haman made it his purpose to put an end to all the Jews, even Mordecai's people, through all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the first month, the month Nissan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, from day to day and from month to month they went on looking for a sign given by Pur that is chance before Haman, till the sign came out for the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Haman said to King Ahasuerus, »There is a nation living here and there in small groups among the people in all the divisions of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of any other nation. They do not keep the king's laws. For this reason it is not right for the king to let them be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»If it is the king's pleasure, let a statement ordering their destruction be put in writing.

They put in writing Haman's orders to all the king's captains and the rulers of every division of his kingdom and the chiefs of every people. It was to be for every division of the kingdom in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in the language which was theirs.
