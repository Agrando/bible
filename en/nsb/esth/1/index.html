The captains of the army of Persia and Media, the great men and the rulers of the divisions of his kingdom, were present before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For a long time, even a hundred and eighty days, he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom and the great power and honor that was his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>At the end of that time, the king gave a feast for all the people who were present in Shushan, the king's town, small as well as great, for seven days, in the outer square of the garden of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There were hangings of white and green and blue, fixed with cords of purple and the best cotton linen to silver rings and pillars of polished stone. The seats were of gold and silver on a floor of red and white and yellow and black stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They served drinks in gold vessels. Every vessel was different. The king freely gave wine from the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The drinking was in keeping with the law. No one was forced: for the king gave orders to all the chief servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Vashti the queen gave a feast for the women in the house of King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was glad with wine, he gave orders to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presences of King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That Vashti the queen was to come before him, with her royal crown, and let the people and the captains see her beauty: for she was very beautiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when the servants gave her the king's order, Vashti the queen said she would not come. The king was very angry. His heart was burning with wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The king spoke to the wise men that were experts with knowledge of the times. It was the king's practice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The closest to the king were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media. They were friends of the king, and had the first places in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»By law, what is to be done to Vashti the queen? She has not done what King Ahasuerus ordered her to do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Before the king and the captains, Memucan gave his answer: »Vashti the queen has done wrong, not only to the king, but also to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the divisions of the kingdom of King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»For news of what the queen has done will come to the attention of all women. They will no longer give respect to their husbands when it is said to them, King Ahasuerus gave orders for Vashti the queen to come before him and she did not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The wives of the captains of Persia and Media, hearing what the queen has done, will say the same to all the king's captains. So there will be much shame and anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»If it is pleasing to the king, let an order go out from him. Let it be recorded among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it may never be changed. That Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place to another who is better than she.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»When the kings order is made public through all his great kingdom all the wives will give honor to their husbands, great as well as small.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains. The king did as Memucan said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom where their language is used. The letter said that every man was to be the ruler in his house, and that this order was to be given out in the language of his people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
