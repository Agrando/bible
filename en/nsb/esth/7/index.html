For it will be given to you. What is your request? For it will be done, even to the half of my kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Esther the queen, answered: »If I have your approval, O king, and if it is the king's pleasure, let my life be given to me in answer to my petition. My people at my request:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»For my people and I have been sold for slaughter and destruction. If we had been taken as men-servants and women-servants for a price, I would have said nothing, for our trouble is little in comparison with the king's loss.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen: »Who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Esther said: »Our hater and attacker is this evil Haman.« Then Haman was full of fear before the king and the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The king in his anger got up from the feast and went into the garden. Haman got to his feet to plead to Esther the queen for his life. He saw that the king had already decided against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking. Haman was stretched out on the seat where Esther was. Then the king said: »Is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house?« While the words were on the king's lips, they put a cloth over Haman's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Harbonah, one of the court officials waiting before the king, said: »See, the pillar fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who said a good word for the king, is still in its place near Haman's house.« Then the king said: »Put him to death by hanging him on it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he made for Mordecai. Then the king's rage subsided.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
