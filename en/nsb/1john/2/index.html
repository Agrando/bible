If any man sin, we have an Advocate intercessorcomforterhelper with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He is the propitiation Greek: hilasmos: atonement, compensation for our sins. Not for ours only, but also for the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We know that we know him, when we obey his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He who says: I know him, and does not obey his commandments is a liar! The truth is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Whoever obeys his Word; the love of God is made perfect completemature in him. By this we know that we are in union with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that says he lives in union with him should walk as he walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment you had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word that you heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then again, I do write a new commandment to you. This is true in him and in you. The darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves his brother lives in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling offence in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness. He does not know where he goes because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I write to you, my little children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do not love the world or the things in the world. If any one loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The entire world, the desire of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of material wealth, is not from the Father, but is from the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The world and its desires lusts are passing away; but he who does the will of God lives forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, it is the last hour! You heard that the antichrist is coming. Even now many antichrists have come. That is how we know that it is the last hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went out from us, but they were not of us. If they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they went out that it made it plain that they all are not of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, even he who denies the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As for you, let that live in you, which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning lives in you, you will also live in the Son, and in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is the promise he promised us, life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I write you these things concerning those who would lead you astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The anointing special endowment of Holy Spirit you received from Him is a part of you is with you and you do not need anyone any human to teach you. His anointing taught you concerning all things. It is no lie. It is truth, just as you were taught you live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now, my little children dwell Greek: meno: stay, dwell, be present with him. If he shall be made known we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming presencebeing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you know that he is righteous you know that every one who practices righteousness is born of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
