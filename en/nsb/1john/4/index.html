Test the spirits to see whether they are from God. This is because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Here is how you know the Spirit of God, every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist that you heard was coming and now it is already in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are of God, my little children. You have overcome them because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are from the world. They speak that which is from the world and the world listens to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are from God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the vital principle spirit of truth, and the principle spirit of deception error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved let us love one another, for love is from God.

If we love one another, God lives with us, and his love is perfected accomplishedmatured through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We know that we live with him and he with us, because he has given us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We see and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives with him, and he with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We know and believe the love that God has for us. God is love! He who continues with love lives with God and God lives with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This is love made perfect through us, that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment.
