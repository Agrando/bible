And his commandments are not burdensome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everything born from God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world, even our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is the one who conquers overcomesprevails over the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ. He did not come with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. The Spirit gives witness because it is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There are three that testify: Latin Vulgate: tres testimonium: three that testify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Spirit, the water, and the blood, and the three are in agreement accordconcurrenceharmony.
