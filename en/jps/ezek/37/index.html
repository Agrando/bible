And I answered: 'O Lord GOD, Thou knowest.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then He said unto me: 'Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them: O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a commotion, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said He unto me: 'Prophesy unto the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then He said unto me: 'Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy, and say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will put My spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land; and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken, and performed it, saith the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>'And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it: For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions; then take another stick, and write upon it: For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and of all the house of Israel his companions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>say into them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them unto him together with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; so shall they be My people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And My servant David shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd; they shall also walk in Mine ordinances, and observe My statutes, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob My servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children, for ever; and David My servant shall be their prince for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them--it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will establish them, and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My dwelling-place also shall be over them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the nations shall know that I am the LORD that sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
