Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto me: 'Hast thou seen this, O son of man?' Then he led me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when I had been brought back, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said he unto me: 'These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and when they shall enter into the sea, into the sea of the putrid waters, the waters shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall come to pass, that every living creature wherewith it swarmeth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, that all things be healed and may live whithersoever the river cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; there shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the Great Sea, exceeding many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given for salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail; it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD: 'This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel, Joseph receiving two portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it unto your fathers; and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this shall be the border of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, by the Jordan, from the border unto the east sea shall ye measure.
