and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will cast thee into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers; thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; to the beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the heaven have I given thee for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When they take hold of thee with the hand, thou dost break, and rend all their shoulders; and when they lean upon thee, thou breakest, and makest all their loins to be at a stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste, and they shall know that I am the LORD; because he hath said: The river is mine, and I have made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from Migdol to Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For thus saith the Lord GOD: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I will turn the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their origin; and they shall be there a lowly kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It shall be the lowliest of the kingdoms, neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations; and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn after them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>'Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her abundance, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have given him the land of Egypt as his hire for which he served, because they wrought for Me, saith the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that day will I cause a horn to shoot up unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
