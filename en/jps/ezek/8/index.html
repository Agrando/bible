So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said unto me: 'Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from My sanctuary? but thou shalt again see yet greater abominations.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said He unto me: 'Son of man, dig now in the wall'; and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said unto me: 'Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I went in and saw; and behold every detestable form of creeping things and beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said He unto me: 'Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say: The LORD seeth us not, the LORD hath forsaken the land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said also unto me: 'Thou shalt again see yet greater abominations which they do.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then He brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said He unto me: 'Hast thou seen this, O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then He said unto me: 'Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here in that they fill the land with violence, and provoke Me still more, and, lo, they put the branch to their nose?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore will I also deal in fury; Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in Mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
