and he stood in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the man said unto me: 'Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee, for to the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou brought thither; declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand-breadth each; so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed, and the height, one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof; and he measured the jamb of the gate, one reed broad, and the other jamb, one reed broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And every cell was one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the cells was five cubits; and the jambs of the gate by the porch of the gate within were one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the cells of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure; and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits;

one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he said unto me: 'This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar;
