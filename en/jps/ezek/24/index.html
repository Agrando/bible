I also will make the pile great,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>heaping on the wood, kindling the fire, that the flesh may be consumed; and preparing the mixture, that the bones also may be burned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then will I set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the bottom thereof may burn, and that the impurity of it may be molten in it, that the filth of it may be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It hath wearied itself with toil; yet its great filth goeth not forth out of it, yea, its noisome filth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because of thy filthy lewdness, because I have purged thee and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have satisfied My fury upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I the LORD have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>'Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet neither shalt thou make lamentation nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sigh in silence; make no mourning for the dead, bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thine upper lip, and eat not the bread of men.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So I spoke unto the people in the morning, and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the people said unto me: 'Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then I said unto them: 'The word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the longing of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your upper lips, nor eat the bread of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet; ye shall not make lamentation nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do; when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the yearning of their soul, their sons and their daughters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In that day shall thy mouth be opened together with him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb; so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
