for they are at hand to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel, and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance; and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because they say unto you: Thou land art a devourer of men, and hast been a bereaver of thy nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>neither will I suffer the shame of the nations any more to be heard against thee, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to stumble any more, saith the Lord GOD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>'Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings; their way before Me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wherefore I poured out My fury upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they came unto the nations, whither they came, they profaned My holy name; in that men said of them: These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of His land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I had pity for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: I do not this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sanctify My great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will put My spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep Mine ordinances, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be My people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I will save you from all your uncleannesses; and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Not for your sake do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you; be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they shall say: This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate; I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed seasons, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am the LORD.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
