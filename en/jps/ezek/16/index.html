And thou didst increase and grow up, and thou camest to excellent beauty: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, and, behold, thy time was the time of love, I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness; yea, I swore unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest Mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then washed I thee with water; yea, I cleansed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I clothed thee also with richly woven work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I wound fine linen about thy head, and covered thee with silk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I put a ring upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and richly woven work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou didst wax exceeding beautiful, and thou wast meet for royal estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through My splendour which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But thou didst trust in thy beauty and play the harlot because of thy renown, and didst pour out thy harlotries on every one that passed by; his it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou didst take of thy garments, and didst make for thee high places decked with divers colours, and didst play the harlot upon them; the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and thou didst take thy richly woven garments and cover them, and didst set Mine oil and Mine incense before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savour, and thus it was; saith the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto Me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy harlotries a small matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that thou hast slain My children, and delivered them up, in setting them apart unto them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all thine abominations and thy harlotries thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast wallowing in thy blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after all thy wickedness--woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>that thou hast built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou hast built thy lofty place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy harlotries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou hast also played the harlot with the Egyptians, thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy harlotry, to provoke Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, therefore I have stretched out My hand over thee, and have diminished thine allowance, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, without having enough; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thou hast moreover multiplied thy harlotry with the land of traffic, even with Chaldea; and yet thou didst not have enough herewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of a wanton harlot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot that enhanceth her hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thou wife that committest adultery, that takest strangers instead of thy husband--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>to all harlots gifts are given; but thou hast given thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hast bribed them to come unto thee from every side in thy harlotries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the contrary is in thee from other women, in that thou didst solicit to harlotry, and wast not solicited; and in that thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, thus thou art contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy harlotries with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, unto whom thou hast been pleasant, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee from every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall also bring up an assembly against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So will I satisfy My fury upon thee, and My jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted Me in all these things; lo, therefore I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord GOD; or hast thou not committed this lewdness above all thine abominations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying: As the mother, so her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou art thy mother's daughter, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children; your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but in a very little while thou didst deal more corruptly than they in all thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and careless ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Neither hath Samaria committed even half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Thou also, bear thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou; yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And I will turn their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the taunt of the daughters of Aram, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that have thee in disdain round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For thus saith the Lord GOD: I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder sisters and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not because of thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And I will establish My covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame; when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
