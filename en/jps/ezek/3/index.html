Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And He said unto me: 'Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with My words unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thou art not sent to a people of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue, but to the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>not to many peoples of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not consent to hearken unto thee; for they consent not to hearken unto Me; for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead; fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover He said unto me: 'Son of man, all My words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them: Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then a spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing: 'Blessed be the glory of the LORD from His place';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>also the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So a spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat; and I remained there appalled among them seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>'Son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; and when thou shalt hear a word at My mouth, thou shalt give them warning from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I say unto the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hand of the LORD came there upon me; and He said unto me: 'Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there speak with thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and He spoke with me, and said unto me: 'Go, shut thyself within thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thou, son of man, behold, bands shall be put upon thee, and thou shalt be bound with them, and thou shalt not go out among them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD; he that heareth, let him hear, and he that forbeareth, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
