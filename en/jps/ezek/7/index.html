and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD: An evil, a singular evil, behold, it cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end is come, the end is come, it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The turn is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land; the time is come, the day of tumult is near, and not of joyful shouting upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now will I shortly pour out My fury upon thee, and spend Mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I will bring upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I the LORD do smite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold the day; behold, it cometh; the turn is come forth; the rod hath blossomed, arrogancy hath budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; nought cometh from them, nor from their tumult, nor from their turmoil, neither is there eminency among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time is come, the day draweth near; let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive; for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any stand possessed of the iniquity of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have blown the horn, and have made all ready, but none goeth to the battle; for My wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within; he that is in the field shall die with the sword, and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they that shall at all escape of them, shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All hands shall be slack, and all knees shall drip with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for the beauty of their ornament, which was set for a pride, they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things thereof; therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also turn My face from them, and they shall profane My secret place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses; I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Horror cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Calamity shall come upon calamity, and rumour shall be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet, and instruction shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with appalment, and the hands of the people of the land shall be enfeebled; I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
