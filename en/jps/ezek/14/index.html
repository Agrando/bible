should I be inquired of at all by them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his mind, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet--I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all turned away from Me through their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from Me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet, that he inquire for him of Me--I the LORD will answer him by Myself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and I will set My face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the prophet is enticed and speaketh a word, I the LORD have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall bear their iniquity; the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that inquireth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that the house of Israel may go no more astray from Me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be My people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>'Son of man, when a land sinneth against Me by trespassing grievously, and I stretch out My hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they bereave it, and it be desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say: Let the sword go through the land, so that I cut off from it man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out My fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For thus saith the Lord GOD: How much more when I send My four sore judgments against Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, behold, though there be left a remnant therein that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters; behold, when they come forth unto you, and ye see their way and their doings, then ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings, and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
