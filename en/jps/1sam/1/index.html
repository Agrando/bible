And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there priests unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass upon a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, that he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she vexed her; therefore she wept, and would not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elkanah her husband said unto her: 'Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk--now Eli the priest sat upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and she was in bitterness of soul--and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow, and said: 'O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, as she prayed long before the LORD, that Eli watched her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; therefore, Eli thought she had been drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said unto her: 'How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said: 'No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken hitherto.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered and said: 'Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of Him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said: 'Let thy servant find favour in thy sight.' So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel: 'because I have asked him of the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband: 'Until the child be weaned, when I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said unto her: 'Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish His word.' So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the child was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when the bullock was slain, the child was brought to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said: 'Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath granted me my petition which I asked of Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>therefore I also have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he is lent to the LORD.' And he worshipped the LORD there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
