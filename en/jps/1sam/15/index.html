So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is in front of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, even the young of the second birth, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but every thing that was of no account and feeble, that they destroyed utterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'It repenteth Me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following Me, and hath not performed My commandments.' And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying: 'Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he is setting him up a monument, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him: 'Blessed be thou of the LORD; I have performed the commandment of the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said: 'What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said: 'They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said unto Saul: 'Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night.' And he said unto him: 'Say on.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said: 'Though thou be little in thine own sight, art thou not head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed thee king over Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said: Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of the LORD?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said unto Samuel: 'Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said: 'Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in hearkening to the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, He hath also rejected thee from being king.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said unto Samuel: 'I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words; because I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said unto Saul: 'I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said unto him: 'The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent; for He is not a man, that He should repent.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said: 'I have sinned; yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel returned after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then said Samuel: 'Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.' And Agag came unto him in chains. And Agag said: 'Surely the bitterness of death is at hand.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeath-shaul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel never beheld Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul; and the LORD repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
