And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: 'Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if the man said unto him: 'Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth'; then he would say: 'Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: 'The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD.' And they would go unto their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the LORD remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto them: 'Why do ye such things? for I hear evil reports concerning you from all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear the LORD'S people do spread abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?' But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him: 'Thus saith the LORD: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now the LORD saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all the increase of thy house shall die young men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
