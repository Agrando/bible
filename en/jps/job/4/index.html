But who can withhold himself from speaking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now it is come upon thee, and thou art weary; it toucheth thee, and thou art affrighted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?
