Or who hath disposed the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If He set His heart upon man, if He gather unto Himself his spirit and his breath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return unto dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If now thou hast understanding, hear this; hearken to the voice of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall even one that hateth right govern? And wilt thou condemn Him that is just and mighty--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is it fit to say to a king: 'Thou art base'? Or to nobles: 'Ye are wicked'?--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That respecteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? For they all are the work of His hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment they die, even at midnight; the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, and He seeth all his goings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For He doth not appoint a time unto any man, when he should go before God in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquisition, and setteth others in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore He taketh knowledge of their works; and He overturneth them in the night, so that they are crushed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because they turned aside from following Him, and would not have regard to any of His ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto Him, and He heareth the cry of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When He giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hideth His face, who then can behold Him? whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man, alike;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That the godless man reign not, that there be none to ensnare the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For hath any said unto God: 'I have borne chastisement, though I offend not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That which I see not teach Thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shall His recompense be as thou wilt? For thou loathest it, so that thou must choose, and not I; therefore speak what thou knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men of understanding will say unto me, yea, every wise man that heareth me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>'Job speaketh without knowledge, and his words are without discernment.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Would that Job were tried unto the end, because of his answering like wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
