Or why should I not be impatient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Turn unto me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even when I remember I am affrighted, and horror hath taketh hold on my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their houses are safe, without fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They spend their days in prosperity, and peacefully they go down to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet they said unto God: 'Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him?
