Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they cast out their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their young ones wax strong, they grow up in the open field; they go forth, and return not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He scorneth the tumult of the city, neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will the wild-ox be willing to serve thee?
