Or can he that is wise be profitable unto Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it any advantage to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to Him, that thou makest thy ways blameless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Is it for thy fear of Him that He reproveth thee, that He entereth with thee into judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not thy wickedness great? And are not thine iniquities without end?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And as a mighty man, who hath the earth, and as a man of rank, who dwelleth in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden dread affrighted thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Or darkness, that thou canst not see, and abundance of waters cover thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the topmost of the stars, how high they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thou sayest: 'What doth God know? Can He judge through the dark cloud?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thick clouds are a covering to Him, that He seeth not; and He walketh in the circuit of heaven.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wilt thou keep the old way which wicked men have trodden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who said unto God: 'Depart from us'; and what could the Almighty do unto them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet He filled their houses with good things--but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The righteous saw it, and were glad, and the innocent laugh them to scorn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>'Surely their substance is cut off, and their abundance the fire hath consumed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace; thereby shall thine increase be good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Receive, I pray thee, instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up--if thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And lay thy treasure in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Almighty be thy treasure, and precious silver unto thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then surely shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thou shalt make thy prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee, and light shall shine upon thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they cast thee down, thou shalt say: 'There is lifting up'; for the humble person He saveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He delivereth him that is innocent, yea, thou shalt be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
