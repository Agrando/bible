let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is at hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as blackness spread upon the mountains; a great people and a mighty, there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame blazeth; the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing escapeth them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Like the noise of chariots, on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a mighty people set in battle array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces have gathered blackness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They run like mighty men, they climb the wall like men of war; and they move on every one in his ways, and they entangle not their paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neither doth one thrust another, they march every one in his highway; and they break through the weapons, and suffer no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They leap upon the city, they run upon the wall, they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Before them the earth quaketh, the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are become black, and the stars withdraw their shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD uttereth His voice before His army; for His camp is very great, for he is mighty that executeth His word; for great is the day of the LORD and very terrible; and who can abide it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet even now, saith the LORD, turn ye unto Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God; for He is gracious and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, and repenteth Him of the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who knoweth whether He will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind Him, even a meal-offering and a drink- offering unto the LORD your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blow the horn in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her pavilion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say: 'Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not Thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should make them a byword: wherefore should they say among the peoples: Where is their God?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then was the LORD jealous for His land, and had pity on His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD answered and said unto His people: 'Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I will remove far off from you the northern one, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the eastern sea, and his hinder part toward the western sea; that his foulness may come up, and his ill savour may come up, because he hath done great things.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for the LORD hath done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God; for He giveth you the former rain in just measure, and He causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the floors shall be full of corn, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpiller, and the palmer- worm, My great army which I sent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and there is none else; and My people shall never be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as the LORD hath said, and among the remnant those whom the LORD shall call.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
