But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him: 'What meanest thou that thou sleepest? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said every one to his fellow: 'Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.' So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said they unto him: 'Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto them: 'I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him: 'What is this that thou hast done?' For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said they unto him: 'What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?' for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said unto them: 'Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said: 'We beseech Thee, O LORD, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for Thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased Thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
