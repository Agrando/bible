her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of sprinkling; it is a purification from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that toucheth the dead, even any man's dead body, shall be unclean seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall be clean;
