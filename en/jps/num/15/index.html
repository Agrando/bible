as ye do, so he shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As for the congregation, there shall be one statute both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you, a statute for ever throughout your generations; as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>One law and one ordinance shall be both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye come into the land whither I bring you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall set apart a portion for a gift unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Of the first of your dough ye shall set apart a cake for a gift; as that which is set apart of the threshing-floor, so shall ye set it apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD a portion for a gift throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then it shall be, if it be done in error by the congregation, it being hid from their eyes, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD--with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance--and one he-goat for a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven;

and he shall be forgiven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>both he that is home-born among the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them: ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught in error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken His commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD said unto Moses: 'The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>'Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them throughout their generations fringes in the corners of their garments, and that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of blue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
