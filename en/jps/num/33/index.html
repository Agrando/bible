destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And ye shall drive out the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families--to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance; wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as thorns in your eyes,

I do unto you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
