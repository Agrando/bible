and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee, thou and thy sons with thee being before the tent of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent; only they shall not come nigh unto the holy furniture and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, whatsoever the service of the Tent may be; but a common man shall not draw nigh unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye shall keep the charge of the holy things, and the charge of the altar, that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel; for you they are given as a gift unto the LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood in everything that pertaineth to the altar, and to that within the veil; and ye shall serve; I give you the priesthood as a service of gift; and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD spoke unto Aaron: 'And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of My heave-offerings; even of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel unto thee have I given them for a consecrated portion, and to thy sons, as a due for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every guilt-offering of theirs, which they may render unto Me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In a most holy place shalt thou eat thereof; every male may eat thereof; it shall be holy unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever; every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the corn, the first part of them which they give unto the LORD, to thee have I given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Every thing that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto the LORD, both of man and beast, shall be thine; howbeit the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And their redemption-money--from a month old shalt thou redeem them--shall be, according to thy valuation, five shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary--the same is twenty gerahs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt dash their blood against the altar, and shalt make their fat smoke for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever; it is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD said unto Aaron: 'Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them; I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the Levites alone shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they set apart as a gift unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said unto them: Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>'Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them: When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall set apart of it a gift for the LORD, even a tithe of the tithe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the gift which ye set apart shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the wine-press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus ye also shall set apart a gift unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give the gift which is set apart unto the LORD to Aaron the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Out of all that is given you ye shall set apart all of that which is due unto the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore thou shalt say unto them: When ye set apart the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye may eat it in every place, ye and your households; for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that ye have set apart from it the best thereof; and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
