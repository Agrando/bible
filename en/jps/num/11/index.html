and wherefore have I not found favour in Thy sight, that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that Thou shouldest say unto me: Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which Thou didst swear unto their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they trouble me with their weeping, saying: Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all this people myself alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in Thy sight; and let me not look upon my wretchedness.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and speak with thee there; and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And say thou unto the people: Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying: Would that we were given flesh to eat! for it was well with us in Egypt; therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected the LORD who is among you, and have troubled Him with weeping, saying: Why, now, came we forth out of Egypt?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said: 'The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and yet Thou hast said: I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If flocks and herds be slain for them, will they suffice them?
