if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If a man cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God,    to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith: 'This is it,' the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep, and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the oath of the LORD shall be between them both, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good;

for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou afflict them in any wise--for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If thou lend money to any of My people, even to the poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor;

wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou shalt not revile God,    nor curse a ruler of thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thou shalt not delay to offer of the fulness of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye shall be holy men unto Me; therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
