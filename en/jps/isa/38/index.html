And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him: 'Thus saith the LORD: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said: 'Remember now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.' And Hezekiah wept sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>'Go, and say to Hezekiah: Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this shall be the sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that He hath spoken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>behold, I will cause the shadow of the dial, which is gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz, to return backward ten degrees.' So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I said: In the noontide of my days I shall go, even to the gates of the nether-world; I am deprived of the residue of my years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I said: I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My habitation is plucked up and carried away from me as a shepherd's tent; I have rolled up like a weaver my life; He will cut me off from the thrum; from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The more I make myself like unto a lion until morning, the more it breaketh all my bones; from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like a swallow or a crane, so do I chatter, I do moan as a dove; mine eyes fail with looking upward. O LORD, I am oppressed, be Thou my surety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What shall I say? He hath both spoken unto me, and Himself hath done it; I shall go softly all my years for the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Lord, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore recover Thou me, and make me to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness; but Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; for Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the nether-world cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee; they that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The living, the living, he shall praise Thee, as I do this day; the father to the children shall make known Thy truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The LORD is ready to save me; therefore we will sing songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaiah said: 'Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah said.
