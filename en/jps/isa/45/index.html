Shall the clay say to him that fashioned it: 'What makest thou?' Or: 'Thy work, it hath no hands'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe unto him that saith unto his father: 'Wherefore begettest thou?' Or to a woman: 'Wherefore travailest thou?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask Me of the things that are to come; concerning My sons, and concerning the work of My hands, command ye Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I, even I, have made the earth, and created man upon it; I, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have roused him up in victory, and I make level all his ways; he shall build My city, and he shall let Mine exiles go free, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus saith the LORD: The labour of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine; they shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over; and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee: Surely God is in thee, and there is none else, there is no other God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Verily Thou art a God that hidest Thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They shall be ashamed, yea, confounded, all of them; they shall go in confusion together that are makers of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O Israel, that art saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens, He is God; that formed the earth and made it, He established it, He created it not a waste, He formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD, and there is none else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob: 'Seek ye Me in vain'; I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations; they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Declare ye, and bring them near, yea, let them take counsel together: Who hath announced this from ancient time, and declared it of old? Have not I the LORD? And there is no God else beside Me, a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By Myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from My mouth in righteousness, and shall not come back, that unto Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only in the LORD, shall one say of Me, is victory and strength; even to Him shall men come in confusion, all they that were incensed against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
