I have announced unto thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not from of old, and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say: 'Behold, I knew them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For My name's sake will I defer Mine anger, and for My praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have tried thee in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For Mine own sake, for Mine own sake, will I do it; for how should it be profaned? And My glory will I not give to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel My called: I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath spread out the heavens; when I call unto them, they stand up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? He whom the LORD loveth shall perform His pleasure on Babylon, and show His arm on the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have spoken, yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come ye near unto Me, hear ye this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I; and now the Lord GOD hath sent me, and His spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the LORD thy God, who teacheth thee for thy profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that thou wouldest hearken to My commandments! then would thy peace be as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy seed also would be as the sand, and the offspring of thy body like the grains thereof; his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye: 'The LORD hath redeemed His servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they thirsted not when He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He cleaved the rock also, and the waters gushed out.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, saith the LORD concerning the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
