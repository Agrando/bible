The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and festering sores: they have not been pressed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by floods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? saith the LORD; I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When ye come to appear before Me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample My courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain oblations; it is an offering of abomination unto Me; new moon and sabbath, the holding of convocations--I cannot endure iniquity along with the solemn assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your appointed seasons My soul hateth; they are a burden unto Me; I am weary to bear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes, cease to do evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How is the faithful city become a harlot! She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards; they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I will ease Me of Mine adversaries, and avenge Me of Mine enemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will turn My hand upon thee, and purge away thy dross as with lye, and will take away all thine alloy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning; afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and they that return of her with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
