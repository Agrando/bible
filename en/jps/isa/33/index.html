When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou art weary with dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for Thee; be Thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of Thyself the nations are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathereth; as locusts leap do they leap upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The LORD is exalted, for He dwelleth on high; He hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the stability of thy times shall be a hoard of salvation--wisdom and knowledge, and the fear of the LORD which is His treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth; he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed, it withereth; Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel are clean bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now will I arise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift Myself up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ye conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that shall devour you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime; as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge My might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the ungodly: 'Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given, his waters shall be sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold a land stretching afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thy heart shall muse on the terror: 'Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed?
