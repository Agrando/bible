To whom will ye flee for help? And where will ye leave your glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They can do nought except crouch under the captives, and fall under the slain. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O Asshur, the rod of Mine anger, in whose hand as a staff is Mine indignation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I do send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath do I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he saith: 'Are not my princes all of them kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not Calno as Carchemish?
