And the LORD saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He saw that there was no man, and was astonished that there was no intercessor; therefore His own arm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sustained Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon His head, and He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay, fury to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; to the islands He will repay recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun; for distress will come in like a flood, which the breath of the LORD driveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And a redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for Me, this is My covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and My words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
