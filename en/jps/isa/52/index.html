They that rule over them do howl, saith the LORD, and My name continually all the day is blasphemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore My people shall know My name; therefore they shall know in that day that I, even He that spoke, behold, here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger of good tidings, that announceth peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announceth salvation; that saith unto Zion: 'Thy God reigneth!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hark, thy watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see, eye to eye, the LORD returning to Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the LORD hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The LORD hath made bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, ye that bear the vessels of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight; for the LORD will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rearward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, My servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>According as many were appalled at thee--so marred was his visage unlike that of a man, and his form unlike that of the sons of men--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So shall he startle many nations, kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they perceive.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
