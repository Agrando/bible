And whom shall one make to understand the message? Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it is precept by precept, precept by precept, line by line, line by line; here a little, there a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For with stammering lips and with a strange tongue shall it be spoken to this people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom it was said: 'This is the rest, give ye rest to the weary; and this is the refreshing'; yet they would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And so the word of the LORD is unto them precept by precept, precept by precept, line by line, line by line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scoffers, the ballad-mongers of this people which is in Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because ye have said: 'We have made a covenant with death, and with the nether-world are we at agreement; when the scouring scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood have we hid ourselves';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a costly corner-stone of sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with the nether-world shall not stand; when the scouring scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As often as it passeth through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night; and it shall be sheer terror to understand the message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the bed is too short for a man to stretch himself; and the covering too narrow when he gathereth himself up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the LORD will rise up as in mount Perazim, He will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that He may do His work, strange is His work, and bring to pass His act, strange is His act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bands be made strong; for an extermination wholly determined have I heard from the Lord, the GOD of hosts, upon the whole land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give ye ear, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Is the plowman never done with plowing to sow, with the opening and harrowing of his ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the black cummin, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the appointed place and the spelt in the border thereof?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For He doth instruct him aright; his God doth teach him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the black cummin is not threshed with a threshing-sledge, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the black cummin is beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is bread corn crushed? Nay, he will not ever be threshing it; and though the roller of his wagon and its sharp edges move noisily, he doth not crush it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts: Wonderful is His counsel, and great His wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
