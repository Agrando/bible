pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I love them that love me, and those that seek me earnestly shall find me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Riches and honour are with me; yea, enduring riches and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my produce than choice silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The LORD made me as the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>While as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When He established the heavens, I was there; when He set a circle upon the face of the deep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep showed their might,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters should not transgress His commandment, when He appointed the foundations of the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then I was by Him, as a nursling; and I was daily all delight, playing always before Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Playing in His habitable earth, and my delights are with the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore, ye children, hearken unto me; for happy are they that keep my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoso findeth me findeth life, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But he that misseth me wrongeth his own soul;
