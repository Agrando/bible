but a grievous word stirreth up anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright; but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch upon the evil and the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A soothing tongue is a tree of life; but perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A fool despiseth his father's correction; but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the house of the righteous is much treasure; but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; but the heart of the foolish is not stedfast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD; but the prayer of the upright is His delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD; but He loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way; and he that hateth reproof shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The nether-world and Destruction are before the LORD; how much more then the hearts of the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A scorner loveth not to be reproved; he will not go unto the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance; but by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The heart of him that hath discernment seeketh knowledge; but the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All the days of the poor are evil; but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is little with the fear of the LORD, than great treasure and turmoil therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A wrathful man stirreth up discord; but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of the sluggard is as though hedged by thorns; but the path of the upright is even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A wise son maketh a glad father; but a foolish man despiseth his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Folly is joy to him that lacketh understanding; but a man of discernment walketh straightforwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For want of counsel purposes are frustrated; but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth; and a word in due season, how good is it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The path of life goeth upward for the wise, that he may depart from the nether-world beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The LORD will pluck up the house of the proud; but He will establish the border of the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The thoughts of wickedness are an abomination to the LORD; but words of pleasantness are pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The heart of the righteous studieth to answer; but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The LORD is far from the wicked; but He heareth the prayer of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart; and a good report maketh the bones fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul; but he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour goeth humility.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
