but let thy heart keep my commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thy heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So shalt thou find grace and good favour in the sight of God and man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust in the LORD with all thy heart, and lean not upon thine own understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the LORD, and depart from evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD, neither spurn thou His correction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For whom the LORD loveth He correcteth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that obtaineth understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that holdest her fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By His knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, let not them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thou shalt not dash thy foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid; yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Be not afraid of sudden terror, neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say not unto thy neighbour: 'Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give'; when thou hast it by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Envy thou not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD; but His counsel is with the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked; but He blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them, but unto the humble He giveth grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The wise shall inherit honour;
