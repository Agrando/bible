for the locust shall consume it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olives shall drop off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine; for they shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All thy trees and the fruit of thy land shall the locust possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The stranger that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher; and thou shalt come down lower and lower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him; he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>because thou didst not serve the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things; and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The LORD will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the vulture swoopeth down; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>a nation of fierce countenance, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favour to the young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed; that also shall not leave thee corn, wine, or oil, the increase of thy kine, or the young of thy flock, until he have caused thee to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, wherein thou didst trust, throughout all thy land; and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters whom the LORD thy God hath given thee; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall straiten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil against his brother, and against the wife of his bosom, and against the remnant of his children whom he hath remaining;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he hath nothing left him; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee in all thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil against the husband of her bosom, and against her son, and against her daughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and against her afterbirth that cometh out from between her feet, and against her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee in thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and awful Name, the LORD thy God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And He will bring back upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast in dread of; and they shall cleave unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And the LORD shall scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among these nations shalt thou have no repose, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot; but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and languishing of soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have no assurance of thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning thou shalt say: 'Would it were even!' and at even thou shalt say: 'Would it were morning!' for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And the LORD shall bring thee back into Egypt in ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee: 'Thou shalt see it no more again'; and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwoman, and no man shall buy you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
