or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh a man's life to pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, and sell him; then that thief shall die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you, as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee; and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the same day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD and it be sin in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shalt not pervert the justice due to the stranger, or to the fatherless; nor take the widow's raiment to pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence; therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go back to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
