for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to cause His name to dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for in haste didst thou come forth out of the land of Egypt; that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all they borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover-offering within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to cause His name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover- offering at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose; and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God; thou shalt do no work therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; from the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn shalt thou begin to number seven weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God after the measure of the freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as the LORD thy God blesseth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid- servant, and the Levite that is within they gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in the midst of thee, in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to cause His name to dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose; because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which He shall choose;

and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons; neither shalt thou take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Justice, justice shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar, which the LORD thy God hateth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
