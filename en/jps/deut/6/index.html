and that thy days may be prolonged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee--a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>HEAR, O ISRAEL: THE LORD OUR GOD, THE LORD IS ONE.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land which He swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee--great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill, and cisterns hewn out, which thou the didst not hew, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then beware lest thou forget the LORD, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God;
