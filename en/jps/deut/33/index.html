He shined forth from mount Paran, and He came from the myriads holy, at His right hand was a fiery law unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yea, He loveth the peoples, all His holy ones--they are in Thy hand; and they sit down at Thy feet, receiving of Thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there was a king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let Reuben live, and not die in that his men become few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this for Judah, and he said: Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; his hands shall contend for him, and Thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And of Levi he said: Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one, whom Thou didst prove at Massah, with whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him'; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew he his own children; for they have observed Thy word, and keep Thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall teach Jacob Thine ordinances, and Israel Thy law; they shall put incense before Thee, and whole burnt-offering upon Thine altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by Him; He covereth him all the day, and He dwelleth between his shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And of Joseph he said: Blessed of the LORD be his land; for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, and for the precious things of the yield of the moons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And for the tops of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the everlasting hills,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, and the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush; let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His firstling bullock, majesty is his; and his horns are the horns of the wild-ox; with them he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth; and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out, and, Issachar, in thy tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall call peoples unto the mountain; there shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall suck the abundance of the seas, and the hidden treasures of the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And of Gad he said: Blessed be He that enlargeth Gad; he dwelleth as a lioness, and teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he chose a first part for himself, for there a portion of a ruler was reserved; and there came the heads of the people, he executed the righteousness of the LORD, and His ordinances with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion's whelp, that leapeth forth from Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the sea and the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And of Asher he said: Blessed be Asher above sons; let him be the favoured of his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Iron and brass shall be thy bars; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven as thy help, and in His excellency on the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The eternal God is a dwelling-place, and underneath are the everlasting arms; and He thrust out the enemy from before thee, and said: 'Destroy.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Israel dwelleth in safety, the fountain of Jacob alone, in a land of corn and wine; yea, his heavens drop down dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee? a people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and that is the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
