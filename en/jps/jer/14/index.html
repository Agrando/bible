Yet Thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and Thy name is called upon us; leave us not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus saith the LORD unto this people: Even so have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet; therefore the LORD doth not accept them, now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said unto me: 'Pray not for this people for their good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said I: 'Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them: Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the LORD said unto me: 'The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I unto them; they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD: As for the prophets that prophesy in My name, and I sent them not, yet they say: Sword and famine shall not be in this land, by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters; for I will pour their evil upon them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And thou shalt say this word unto them: Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! For both the prophet and the priest are gone about to a land, and knew it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Hath Thy soul loathed Zion? Why hast Thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold terror!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, even the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not contemn us, for Thy name's sake, do not dishonour the throne of Thy glory; remember, break not Thy covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? Art not Thou He, O LORD our God, and do we not wait for Thee? For Thou hast made all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
