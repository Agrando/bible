Doth one turn away, and not return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I attended and listened, but they spoke not aright; no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying: 'What have I done?' Every one turneth away in his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but My people know not the ordinance of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How do ye say: 'We are wise, and the Law of the LORD is with us'? Lo, certainly in vain hath wrought the vain pen of the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken; Lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them; for from the least even unto the greatest every one is greedy for gain, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people lightly, saying: 'Peace, peace', when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall be put to shame because they have committed abomination; yea, they are not at all ashamed, neither know they how to blush; therefore shall they fall among them that fall, in the time of their visitation they shall stumble, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will utterly consume them, saith the LORD; there are no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is faded; and I gave them that which they transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>'Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be cut off there; for the LORD our God hath cut us off, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold terror!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it, the city and those that dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I will send serpents, basilisks, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Though I would take comfort against sorrow, my heart is faint within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land far off: 'Is not the LORD in Zion? Is not her King in her?'-- 'Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, and with strange vanities?'--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>'The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I seized with anguish; I am black, appalment hath taken hold on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
