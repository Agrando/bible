For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the Lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that counteth them, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, will I cause a shoot of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby she shall be called, the LORD is our righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus saith the LORD: There shall not be cut off unto David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>neither shall there be cut off unto the priests the Levites a man before Me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus saith the LORD: If ye can break My covenant with the day, and My covenant with the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then may also My covenant be broken with David My servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, My ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David My servant, and the Levites that minister unto Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>'Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying: The two families which the LORD did choose, He hath cast them off? and they contemn My people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus saith the LORD: If My covenant be not with day and night, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David My servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have compassion on them.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
