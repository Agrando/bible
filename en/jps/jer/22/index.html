Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Is not this to know Me? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament for him: 'Ah my brother!' or: 'Ah sister!' They shall not lament for him: 'Ah lord!' or: 'Ah his glory!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Lebanon, and cry, and lift up thy voice in Bashan; and cry from Abarim, for all thy lovers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity, but thou saidst: 'I will not hear.' This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou hearkenedst not to My voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall feed upon all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O inhabitant of Lebanon, that art nestled in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon My right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bore thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land whereunto they long to return, thither shall they not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Coniah a despised, broken image? Is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? Wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus saith the LORD: Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
