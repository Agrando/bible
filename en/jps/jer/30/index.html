For the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured, and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they have called thee an outcast: 'She is Zion,    there is none that careth for her.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon her own mound, and the palace shall be inhabited upon its wonted place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry; and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished, I will also increase them, and they shall not dwindle away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before Me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto Me; for who is he that hath pledged his heart to approach unto Me? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall be My people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, a storm of the LORD is gone forth in fury, a sweeping storm; it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until He have executed, and till He have performed the purposes of His heart; in the end of days ye shall consider it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
