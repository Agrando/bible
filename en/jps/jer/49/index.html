Thus saith the LORD: Hath Israel no sons? Hath he no heir? Why then doth Malcam take possession of Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate mound, and her daughters shall be burned with fire; then shall Israel dispossess them that did dispossess him, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is undone; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro among the folds; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that didst trust in thy treasures: 'Who shall come unto me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I will bring a terror upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather up him that wandereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of Edom. Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Is counsel perished from the prudent? Is their wisdom vanished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; For I do bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall punish him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leave thy fatherless children, I will rear them, and let thy widows trust in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus saith the LORD: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have sworn by Myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have heard a message from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the nations: 'Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, behold, I make thee small among the nations, and despised among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, even the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill; though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Edom shall become an astonishment; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan against the strong habitation; for I will suddenly make him run away from it, and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it; for who is like Me? and who will appoint Me a time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that He hath taken against Edom; and His purposes, that He hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall drag them away, surely their habitation shall be appalled at them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The earth quaketh at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, he shall come up and swoop down as the vulture, and spread out his wings against Bozrah; and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of Damascus. Hamath is ashamed, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away; there is trouble in the sea; it cannot be quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her; anguish and pangs have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>'How is the city of praise left unrepaired, the city of my joy?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in her broad places, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith the LORD: Arise ye, go up against Kedar, and spoil the children of the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Their tents and their flocks shall they take, they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall proclaim against them a terror on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Flee ye, flit far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Arise, get you up against a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil; and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners polled; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever; no man shall abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And I will bring against Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the dispersed of Elam shall not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even My fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will set My throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it shall come to pass in the end of days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
