Or who shall bemoan thee? Or who shall turn aside to ask of thy welfare?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou hast cast Me off, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward; Therefore do I stretch out My hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I bereave them of children, I destroy My people, since they return not from their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their widows are increased to Me above the sand of the seas; I bring upon them, against the mother, a chosen one, even a spoiler at noonday; I cause anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She that hath borne seven languisheth; her spirit droopeth; her sun is gone down while it was yet day, she is ashamed and confounded; and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; yet every one of them doth curse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The LORD said: 'Verily I will release thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can iron break iron from the north and brass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in My nostril, which shall burn upon you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou, O LORD, knowest; Remember me, and think of me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away because of Thy long-suffering; know that for Thy sake I have suffered taunts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart; because Thy name was called on me, O LORD God of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of Thy hand; for Thou hast filled me with indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, so that it refuseth to be healed? Wilt Thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook, as waters that fail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD: If thou return, and I bring thee back, thou shalt stand before Me; and if thou bring forth the precious out of the vile, thou shalt be as My mouth; let them return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
