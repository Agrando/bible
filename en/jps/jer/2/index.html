And they that handle the law knew Me not, and the rulers transgressed against Me; the prophets also prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For pass over to the isles of the Kittites, and see, and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there hath been such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Hath a nation changed its gods, which yet are no gods? But My people hath changed its glory for that which doth not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye exceeding amazed, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is Israel a servant? Is he a home-born slave? Why is he become a prey?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The young lions have roared upon him, and let their voice resound; and they have made his land desolate, his cities are laid waste, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The children also of Noph and Tahpanhes feed upon the crown of thy head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not this that doth cause it unto thee, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when He led thee by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? Or what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, neither is My fear in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands, and thou saidst: 'I will not transgress'; upon every high hill and under every leafy tree thou didst recline, playing the harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before Me, saith the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How canst thou say: 'I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim'? See thy way in the Valley, know what thou hast done; thou art a swift young camel traversing her ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; her lust, who can hinder it? All they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst; but thou saidst: 'There is no hope; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who say to a stock: 'Thou art my father', and to a stone: 'Thou hast brought us forth', for they have turned their back unto Me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say: 'Arise, and save us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble; for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wherefore will ye contend with Me? Ye all have transgressed against Me, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In vain have I smitten your children--they received no correction; your sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O generation, see ye the word of the LORD: have I been a wilderness unto Israel? or a land of thick darkness? Wherefore say My people: 'We roam at large; we will come no more unto Thee'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! Therefore--even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor; thou didst not find them breaking in; yet for all these things</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thou saidst: 'I am innocent; surely His anger is turned away from me'--behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest: 'I have not sinned.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>How greatly dost thou cheapen thyself to change thy way? Thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Asshur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>From him also shalt thou go forth, with thy hands upon thy head; for the LORD hath rejected them in whom thou didst trust, and thou shalt not prosper in them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
