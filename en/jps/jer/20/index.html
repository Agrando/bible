Then said Jeremiah unto him: 'The LORD hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover I will give all the store of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the wealth thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O LORD, Thou hast enticed me, and I was enticed, Thou hast overcome me, and hast prevailed; I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For as often as I speak, I cry out, I cry: 'Violence and spoil'; because the word of the LORD is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if I say: 'I will not make mention of Him, nor speak any more in His name', then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I weary myself to hold it in, but cannot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I have heard the whispering of many, terror on every side: 'Denounce, and we will denounce him'; even of all my familiar friends, them that watch for my halting: 'Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the LORD is with me as a mighty warrior; therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be greatly ashamed, because they have not prospered, even with an everlasting confusion which shall never be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the reins and the heart, let me see Thy vengeance on them; for unto Thee have I revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD; for He hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed be the day wherein I was born; the day wherein my mother bore me, let it not be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying: 'A man-child is born unto thee'; making him very glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not; and let him hear a cry in the morning, and an alarm at noontide;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because He slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed in shame?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
