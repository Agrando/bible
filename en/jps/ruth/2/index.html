And she said unto her: 'Go, my daughter.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers: 'The LORD be with you.' And they answered him: 'The LORD bless thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers: 'Whose damsel is this?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said: 'It is a Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the field of Moab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and she said: Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Boaz unto Ruth: 'Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: 'Why have I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldest take cognizance of me, seeing I am a foreigner?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Boaz answered and said unto her: 'It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The LORD recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then she said: 'Let me find favour in thy sight, my LORD; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: 'Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.' And she sat beside the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying: 'Let her glean even among the sheaves, and put her not to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And her mother-in-law said unto her: 'Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.' And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said: 'The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law: 'Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off His kindness to the living and to the dead.' And Naomi said unto her: 'The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ruth the Moabitess said: 'Yea, he said unto me: Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law: 'It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that thou be not met in any other field.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
