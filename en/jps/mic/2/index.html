When the morning is light, they execute it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away; thus they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk upright; for it shall be an evil time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say: 'We are utterly ruined; he changeth the portion of my people; how doth he remove it from me! Instead of restoring our fields, he divideth them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>'Preach ye not', they preach; 'They shall not preach of these things, that they shall not take shame.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do I change, O house of Jacob?
