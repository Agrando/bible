And wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>'Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It hath been told thee, O man, what is good, and what the LORD doth require of thee: only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Hark! the LORD crieth unto the city--and it is wisdom to have regard for Thy name--hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore I also do smite thee with a grievous wound; I do make thee desolate because of thy sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy sickness shall be in thine inward parts; and thou shalt conceive, but shalt not bring forth; and whomsoever thou bringest forth will I give up to the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee an astonishment, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing; and ye shall bear the reproach of My people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
