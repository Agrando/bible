Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there are no pangs at their death, and their body is sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the trouble of man they are not; neither are they plagued like men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their eyes stand forth from fatness; they are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression; they speak as if there were none on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore His people return hither; and waters of fullness are drained out by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they say: 'How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, such are the wicked; and they that are always at ease increase riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the day have I been plagued, and my chastisement came every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I had said: 'I will speak thus', behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when I pondered how I might know this, it was wearisome in mine eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Until I entered into the sanctuary of God, and considered their end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Surely Thou settest them in slippery places; Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are wholly consumed by terrors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As a dream when one awaketh, so, O Lord, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For my heart was in a ferment, and I was pricked in my reins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou holdest my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me with glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish; Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all Thy works.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
