Selah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the LORD'--and Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary; with songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about.
