A Psalm of David. O LORD, Thou hast searched me, and known me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, Thou understandest my thought afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou measurest my going about and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, Thou knowest it altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou hast hemmed me in behind and before, and laid Thy hand upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; too high, I cannot attain unto it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whither shall I go from Thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there; if I make my bed in the nether-world, behold, Thou art there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even there would Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand would hold me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if I say: 'Surely the darkness shall envelop me, and the light about me shall be night';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Even the darkness is not too dark for Thee, but the night shineth as the day; the darkness is even as the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For Thou hast made my reins; Thou hast knit me together in my mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will give thanks unto Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; wonderful are Thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My frame was not hidden from Thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance, and in Thy book they were all written--even the days that were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How weighty also are Thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand; were I to come to the end of them, I would still be with Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If Thou but wouldest slay the wicked, O God--depart from me therefore, ye men of blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who utter Thy name with wicked thought, they take it for falsehood, even Thine enemies--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate Thee?
