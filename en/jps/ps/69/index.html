for the waters are come in even unto the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into deep waters, and the flood overwhelmeth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; they that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are many; should I restore that which I took not away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, Thou knowest my folly; and my trespasses are not hid from Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not them that wait for Thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; let not those that seek Thee be brought to confusion through me, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because zeal for Thy house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I wept with my soul fasting, and that became unto me a reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a byword unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They that sit in the gate talk of me; and I am the song of the drunkards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for me, let my prayer be unto Thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time; O God, in the abundance of Thy mercy, answer me with the truth of Thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Answer me, O LORD, for Thy mercy is good; according to the multitude of Thy compassions turn Thou unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And hide not Thy face from Thy servant; for I am in distress; answer me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; ransom me because of mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion; mine adversaries are all before Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sore sick; and I looked for some to show compassion, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, they put poison into my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let their table before them become a snare; and when they are in peace, let it become a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to totter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour out Thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of Thine anger overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let their encampment be desolate; let none dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they persecute him whom Thou hast smitten; and they tell of the pain of those whom Thou hast wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Add iniquity unto their iniquity; and let them not come into Thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I am afflicted and in pain; let Thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify Him with thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it shall please the LORD better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The humble shall see it, and be glad; ye that seek after God, let your heart revive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the LORD hearkeneth unto the needy, and despiseth not His prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; and they shall abide there, and have it in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The seed also of His servants shall inherit it; and they that love His name shall dwell therein.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
