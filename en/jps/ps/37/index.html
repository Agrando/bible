Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For they shall soon wither like the grass, and fade as the green herb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land, and cherish faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and He shall give thee the petitions of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in Him, and He will bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, and thy right as the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Resign thyself unto the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for the LORD, they shall inherit the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And yet a little while, and the wicked is no more; yea, thou shalt look well at his place, and he is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the humble shall inherit the land, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked plotteth against the righteous, and gnasheth at him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord doth laugh at him; for He seeth that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as are upright in the way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is a little that the righteous hath than the abundance of many wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The LORD knoweth the days of them that are wholehearted; and their inheritance shall be for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil; and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs--they shall pass away in smoke, they shall pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not; but the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For such as are blessed of Him shall inherit the land; and they that are cursed of Him shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It is of the LORD that a man's goings are established; and He delighted in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the LORD upholdeth his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the LORD loveth justice, and forsaketh not His saints; they are preserved for ever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor suffer him to be condemned when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wait for the LORD, and keep His way, and He will exalt thee to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a leafy tree in its native soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But one passed by, and, lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mark the man of integrity, and behold the upright; for there is a future for the man of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But transgressors shall be destroyed together; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the LORD helpeth them, and delivereth them; He delivereth them from the wicked, and saveth them, because they have taken refuge in Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
