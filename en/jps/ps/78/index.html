Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not hide from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That they might put their confidence in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow, that turned back in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they forgot His doings, and His wondrous works that He had shown them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters to stand as a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>By day also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He cleaved rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet went they on still to sin against Him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they tried God in their heart by asking food for their craving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, they spoke against God; they said: 'Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; can He give bread also? or will He provide flesh for His people?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth; and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in His salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and gave them of the corn of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man did eat the bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven; and by His power He brought on the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And He let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they did eat, and were well filled; and He gave them that which they craved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were not estranged from their craving, their food was yet in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the lustieth among them, and smote down the young men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they sinned still, and believed not in His wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore He ended their days as a breath, and their years in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him, and turn back and seek God earnestly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they beguiled Him with their mouth, and lied unto Him with their tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not stedfast with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not; yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away, and doth not stir up all His wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And still again they tried God, and set bounds to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They remembered not His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How He set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Zoan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And turned their rivers into blood, so that they could not drink their streams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-trees with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to fiery bolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a sending of messengers of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And smote all the first-born in Egypt, the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But He made His own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And He led them safely, and they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had gotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High, and kept not His testimonies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked Him with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>God heard, and was wroth, and He greatly abhorred Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had made to dwell among men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the adversary's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He gave His people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins had no marriage-song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awaked as one asleep, like a mighty man recovering from wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And He smote His adversaries backward; He put upon them a perpetual reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He hath founded for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He chose David also His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From following the ewes that give suck He brought him, to be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart; and lead them by the skilfulness of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
