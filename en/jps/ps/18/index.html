my God, my rock, in Him I take refuge; my shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Praised, I cry, is the LORD, and I am saved from mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The cords of Death compassed me, and the floods of Belial    assailed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cords of Sheol    surrounded me; the snares of Death confronted me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God; out of His temple He heard my voice, and my cry came before Him unto His ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth did shake and quake, the foundations also of the mountains did tremble; they were shaken, because He was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Smoke arose up in His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth did devour; coals flamed forth from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, He did swoop down upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness His hiding-place, His pavilion round about Him; darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At the brightness before Him, there passed through His thick clouds hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High gave forth His voice; hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them; and He shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, at Thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from mine enemy most strong, and from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was a stay unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all His ordinances were before me, and I put not away His statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I was single-hearted with Him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful, with the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure; and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For Thou dost save the afflicted people; but the haughty eyes Thou dost humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For Thou dost light my lamp; the LORD my God doth lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For by Thee I run upon a troop; and by my God do I scale a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a Rock, except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way straight;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who maketh my feet like hinds', and setteth me upon my high places;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who traineth my hands for war, so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation, and Thy right hand hath holden me up; and Thy condescension hath made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn back till they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have smitten them through, so that they are not able to rise; they are fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, and I did cut off them that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They cried, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou hast delivered me from the contentions of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As soon as they hear of me, they obey me; the sons of the stranger dwindle away before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The sons of the stranger fade away, and come trembling out of their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The LORD liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, and subdueth peoples under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He delivereth me from mine enemies; yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the nations, and will sing praises unto Thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Great salvation giveth He to His king; and showeth mercy to His anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
