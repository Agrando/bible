O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can express the mighty acts of the LORD, or make all His praise to be heard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Happy are they that keep justice, that do righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O LORD, when Thou favourest Thy people; O think of me at Thy salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That I may behold the prosperity of Thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation, that I may glory with Thine inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers, we have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers in Egypt gave no heed unto Thy wonders; they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies; but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; and He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then believed they His words; they sang His praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They soon forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tried God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They were jealous also of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron the holy one of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Moreover, they scorned the desirable land, they believed not His word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore He swore concerning them, that He would overthrow them in the wilderness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And that He would cast out their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus they provoked Him with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then stood up Phinehas, and wrought judgment, and so the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they served their idols, which became a snare unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus were they defiled with their works, and went astray in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against His people, and He abhorred His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times did He deliver them; but they were rebellious in their counsel, and sank low through their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless He looked upon their distress, when He heard their cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And He remembered for them His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks unto Thy holy name, that we may triumph in Thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting, and let all the people say: 'Amen.' Hallelujah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
