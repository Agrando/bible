Yet ye say: 'Wherein hast Thou loved us?' Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD; yet I loved Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whereas Edom saith: 'We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places'; thus saith the LORD of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called The border of wickedness, and The people whom the LORD execrateth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say: 'The LORD is great beyond the border of Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master; if then I be a father, where is My honour? and if I be a master, where is My fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise My name. And ye say: 'Wherein have we despised Thy name?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine altar. And ye say: 'Wherein have we polluted thee?' In that ye say: 'The table of the LORD is contemptible.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it no evil! And when ye offer the lame and sick, is it no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now, I pray you, entreat the favour of God that He may be gracious unto us!--This hath been of your doing.--Will He accept any of your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Oh that there were even one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on Mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same My name is great among the nations; and in every place offerings are presented unto My name, even pure oblations; for My name is great among the nations, saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But ye profane it, in that ye say: 'The table of the LORD is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even the food thereof, is contemptible.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye say also: 'Behold, what a weariness is it!' and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering; should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But cursed be he that dealeth craftily, whereas he hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and My name is feared among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
