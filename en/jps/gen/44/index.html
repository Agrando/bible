And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward: 'Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them: Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said unto him: 'Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said: 'Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they hastened, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched, beginning at the eldest, and leaving off at the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, and he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said unto them: 'What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I will indeed divine?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said: 'What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said: 'Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the goblet is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near unto him, and said: 'Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying: Have ye a father, or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said unto my lord: We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou saidst unto thy servants: Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said unto my lord: The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou saidst unto thy servants: Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said: Go again, buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said: We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thy servant my father said unto us: Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the one went out from me, and I said: Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his soul is bound up with the lad's soul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying: If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I look upon the evil that shall come on my father.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
