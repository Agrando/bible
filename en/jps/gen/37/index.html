Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being still a lad even with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought evil report of them unto their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren; and they hated him yet the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto them: 'Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and bowed down to my sheaf.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his brethren said to him: 'Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?' And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said: 'Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him: 'What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down to thee to the earth?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Israel said unto Joseph: 'Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them.' And he said to him: 'Here am I.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to him: 'Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me back word.' So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying: 'What seekest thou?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said: 'I seek my brethren. Tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said: 'They are departed hence; for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothan.' And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said one to another: 'Behold, this dreamer cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say: An evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand; and said: 'Let us not take his life.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben said unto them: 'Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him'--that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colours that was on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they took him, and cast him into the pit--and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and ladanum, going to carry it down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah said unto his brethren: 'What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh.' And his brethren hearkened unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he returned unto his brethren, and said: 'The child is not; and as for me, whither shall I go?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said: 'This have we found. Know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he knew it, and said: 'It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said: 'Nay, but I will go down to the grave to my son mourning.' And his father wept for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Midianites    sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
