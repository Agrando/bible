And the stone upon the well's mouth was great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And thither were all the flocks gathered; and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back upon the well's mouth in its place.--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jacob said unto them: 'My brethren, whence are ye?' And they said: 'Of Haran are we.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto them: 'Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?' And they said: 'We know him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto them: 'Is it well with him?' And they said: 'It is well; and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said: 'Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together; water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said: 'We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she tended them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him: 'Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.' And he abode with him the space of a month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Laban said unto Jacob: 'Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Leah's eyes were weak; but Rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said: 'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said: 'It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jacob said unto Laban: 'Give me my wife, for my days are filled, that I may go in unto her.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah; and he said to Laban: 'What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said: 'It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the LORD saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said: 'Because the LORD hath    looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said: 'Because the LORD hath    heard that I am hated, He hath therefore given me this son also.' And she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said: 'Now this time will my husband be joined    unto me, because I have borne him three sons.' Therefore was his name called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said: 'This time will I praise    the LORD.' Therefore she called his name Judah;     and she left off bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
