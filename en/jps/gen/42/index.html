Get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said: 'Lest peradventure harm befall him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Caanan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly with them; and he said unto them: 'Whence come ye?' And they said: 'From the land of Canaan to buy food.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them: 'Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said unto him: 'Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We are all one man's sons; we are upright men, thy servants are no spies.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said unto them: 'Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said: 'We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph said unto them: 'That is it that I spoke unto you, saying: Ye are spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hereby ye shall be proved, as Pharaoh liveth, ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you; or else, as Pharaoh liveth, surely ye are spies.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he put them all together into ward three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said unto them the third day.

And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said one to another: 'We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben answered them, saying: 'Spoke I not unto you, saying: Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for the interpreter was between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus was it done unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they laded their asses with their corn, and departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto his brethren: 'My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack.' And their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying: 'What is this that God hath done unto us?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>'The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we said unto him: We are upright men; we are no spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us: Hereby shall I know that ye are upright men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take corn for the famine of your houses, and go your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And bring your youngest brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are upright men; so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob their father said unto them: 'Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away; upon me are all these things come.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying: 'Thou shalt slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said: 'My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left; if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
