And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and maid-servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: 'We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two camps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said: 'If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said: 'O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants: 'Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he commanded the foremost, saying: 'When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>then thou shalt say: They are thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he also is behind us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: 'In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and ye shall say: Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.' For he said: 'I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the present passed over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said: 'Let me go, for the day breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And be said: 'Jacob.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel;    for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?'
