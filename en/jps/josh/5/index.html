Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal,    unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him: 'Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said: 'Nay, but I am captain of the host of the LORD; I am now come.' And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said unto him: 'What saith my lord unto his servant?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua: 'Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.'
