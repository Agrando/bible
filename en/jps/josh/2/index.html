And they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying: 'Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying: 'Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said: 'Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not; pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had spread out upon the roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, the gate was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and she said unto the men: 'I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father's house--and give me a true token--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the men said unto her: 'Our life for yours, if ye tell not this our business; and it shall be, when the LORD giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said unto them: 'Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and afterward may ye go your way.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men said unto her: 'We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by; and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if thou utter this our business, then we will be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said: 'According unto your words, so be it.'
