And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel: 'I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel: 'Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD today.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them: 'Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?' And they said: 'Go up; for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jehoshaphat said: 'Is there not here besides a prophet of the LORD, that we might inquire of him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.' And Jehoshaphat said: 'Let not the king say so.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said: 'Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in a threshing-floor, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: With these shalt thou gore the Arameans, until they be consumed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying: 'Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying: 'Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth, let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Micaiah said: 'As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him: 'Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?'

I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD said: Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead. And one said: On this manner; and another said: On that manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there came forth the spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said: I will entice him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said unto him: Wherewith?

And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying: 'Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said: 'Surely it is the king of Israel'; and they turned aside to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the lower armour and the breastplate; wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot: 'Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the battle increased that day; and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Arameans, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying: 'Every man to his city, and every man to his country.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; the harlots also washed themselves there; according unto the word of the LORD which He spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD;  howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the remnant of the sodomites that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion- geber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat: 'Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships.' But Jehoshaphat would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
