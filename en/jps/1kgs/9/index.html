And they were called the land of Cabul, unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is the account of the levy which king Solomon raised; to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>even their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These were the chief officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which  Solomon  had built for her; then did he build Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, offering thereby, upon the altar that was before the LORD.
