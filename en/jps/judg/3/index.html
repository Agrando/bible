And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed; and the children of Israel sent a present by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he offered the present unto Eglon king of Moab--now Eglon was a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had made an end of offering the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said: 'I have a secret errand unto thee, O king.' And he said: 'Keep silence.' And all that stood by him went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in his cool upper chamber. And Ehud said: 'I have a message from God unto thee.' And he arose out of his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his belly; and it came out behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper chamber were locked; and they said: 'Surely he is covering his feet in the cabinet of the cool chamber.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper chamber; therefore they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ehud escaped while they lingered, having passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a horn in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto them: 'Follow after me; for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.' And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valour; and there escaped not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also saved Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
