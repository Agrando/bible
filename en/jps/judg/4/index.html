And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet; and Deborah went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as Elon-bezaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth-goiim, unto the brook Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Deborah said unto Barak: 'Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not the LORD gone out before thee?' So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth-goiim; and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him: 'Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not.' And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto her: 'Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.' And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said unto her: 'Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say: Is there any man here? that thou shalt say: No.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him: 'Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest.' And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
