And I also perceived that one event happeneth to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said I in my heart: 'As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?' Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will long ago have been forgotten. And how must the wise man die even as the fool!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I hated all my labour wherein I laboured under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour wherein I had laboured under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there is a man whose labour is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what hath a man of all his labour, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboureth under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days are pains, and his occupation vexation; yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy pleasure for his labour. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who will eat, or who will enjoy, if not I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For to the man that is good in His sight He giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He giveth the task, to gather and to heap up, that he may leave to him that is good in the sight of God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
