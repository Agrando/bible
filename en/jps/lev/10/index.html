And Aaron held his peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them: 'Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons: 'Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither tend your clothes, that ye die not, and that He be not wroth with all the congregation; but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.'
