according to the means of him that vowed shall the priest value him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering unto the LORD, then he shall set the beast before the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD part of the field of his possession, then thy valuation shall be according to the sowing thereof; the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy valuation it shall stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if he sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all thy valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Howbeit the firstling among beasts, which is born as a firstling to the LORD, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is the LORD'S.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof; or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man may devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>None devoted, that may be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S; it is holy unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
