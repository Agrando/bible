and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meal-offering mingled with oil; for to-day the LORD appeareth unto you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said: 'This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do; that the glory of the LORD may appear unto you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, he made smoke upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the flesh and the skin were burnt with fire without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head; and he made them smoke upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he washed the inwards and the legs, and made them smoke upon the burnt-offering on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the people's offering was presented; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the burnt-offering was presented; and he offered it according to the ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and made it smoke upon the altar, besides the burnt- offering of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the fat of the ox, and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he made the fat smoke upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there came forth fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat;
