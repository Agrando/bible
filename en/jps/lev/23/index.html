on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year; it is a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
