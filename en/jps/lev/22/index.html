And whoso toucheth any one that is unclean by the dead; or from whomsoever the flow of seed goeth out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>or whosoever toucheth any swarming thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall therefore keep My charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am the LORD who sanctify them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There shall no common man    eat of the holy thing; a tenant of a priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he may eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they may eat of his bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a priest's daughter be married unto a common man, she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the holy things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if a priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's bread; but there shall no common man eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man eat of the holy thing through error, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they set apart unto the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things; for I am the LORD who sanctify them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that bringeth his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will-offerings, which are brought unto the LORD for a burnt-offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not bring; for it shall not be acceptable for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whosoever bringeth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or for a freewill- offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scabbed, or scurvy, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing too long or too short, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, ye shall not offer unto the LORD; neither shall ye do thus in your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; but from the eighth day and thenceforth it may be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye shall keep My commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And ye shall not profane My holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD who hallow you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
