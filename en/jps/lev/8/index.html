and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled; for He shall consecrate you seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As hath been done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not; for so I am commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
