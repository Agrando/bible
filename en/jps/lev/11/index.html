they are unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them may ye eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that swarm in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are a detestable thing unto you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they shall be a detestable thing unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in detestation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is a detestable thing unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are a detestable thing: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the ospray;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the kite, and the falcon after its kinds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>every raven after its kinds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kinds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the carrion-vulture;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the stork, and the heron after its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All winged swarming things that go upon all fours are a detestable thing unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet these may ye eat of all winged swarming things that go upon all fours, which have jointed legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kinds, and the bald locust after its kinds, and the cricket after its kinds, and the grasshopper after its kinds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But all winged swarming things, which have four feet, are a detestable thing unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And by these ye shall become unclean; whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Every beast which parteth the hoof, but is not cloven footed, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you; every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you; whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even;

whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And every earthen vessel whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All food therein which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink in every such vessel that may be drunk shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nevertheless a fountain or a cistern wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean; but he who toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And if aught of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if water be put upon the seed, and aught of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die, he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all swarming things that swarm upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are a detestable thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Ye shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarmeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For I am the LORD your God; sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy; neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of swarming thing that moveth upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For I am the LORD that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This is the law of the beast, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that swarmeth upon the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
