And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Graciousness, and the other I called Binders; and I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; 'for My soul became impatient of them, and their soul also loathed Me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said I: 'I will not feed you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I took my staff Graciousness, and cut it asunder, 'that I might break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was broken in that day; and the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew of a truth that it was the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I said unto them: 'If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear.'
