And Elisha said: 'As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' So they went down to Beth-el.--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him: 'Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day?' And he said: 'Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.'--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Elijah said unto him: 'Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho.' And he said: 'As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' So they came to Jericho.--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him: 'Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day?' And he answered: 'Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.'--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elijah said unto him: 'Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to the Jordan.' And he said: 'As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' And they two went on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha: 'Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee.' And Elisha said: 'I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said: 'Thou hast asked a hard thing; nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both assunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elisha saw it, and he cried: 'My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!' And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said: 'Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?' and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho some way off saw him, they said: 'The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.' And they came to meet him, and bowed down to the ground before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they said unto him: 'Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; lest peradventure the spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.' And he said: 'Ye shall not send.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said: 'Send.' They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them: 'Did I not say unto you: Go not?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the men of the city said unto Elisha: 'Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth; but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said: 'Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.' And they brought it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him: 'Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
