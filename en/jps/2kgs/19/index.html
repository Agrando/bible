for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD thy God hath heard; wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaiah said unto them: 'Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: 'Behold, he is come out to fight against thee'; he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>'Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said: 'O LORD, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to taunt the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, O LORD our God, save Thou us, I beseech Thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the LORD God, even Thou only.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying: 'Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By the messengers thou hast taunted the Lord, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I have cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice cypresses thereof; and I have entered into his farthest lodge, the forest of his fruitful field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hast thou not heard? long ago I made it, in ancient times I fashioned it; now have I brought it to pass, yea, it is done; that fortified cities should be laid waste into ruinous heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it is grown up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because of thy raging against Me, and for that thy tumult is come up into Mine ears, therefore will I put My hook in thy nose, and My bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For I will defend this city to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
