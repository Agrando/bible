And Ziba said: 'The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said: 'And where is thy master's son?' And Ziba said unto the king: 'Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said: To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said the king to Ziba: 'Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth.' And Ziba said: 'I prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus said Shimei when he cursed: 'Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: 'Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said: 'What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: 'Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that the LORD will look on mine eye, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom: 'Long live the king, long live the king.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Absalom said to Hushai: 'Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Hushai said unto Absalom: 'Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel: 'Give your counsel what we shall do.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: 'Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
