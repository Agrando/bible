And he said unto him: 'Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David said unto him: 'How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.' And he answered: 'The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said unto the young man that told him: 'How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man that told him said: 'As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered: Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said unto me: Who art thou? And I answered him: I am an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto me: Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for the agony hath taken hold of me; because my life is just yet in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they wailed, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said unto the young man that told him: 'Whence art thou?' And he answered: 'I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said unto him: 'How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David called one of the young men, and said: 'Go near, and fall upon him.' And he smote him that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said unto him: 'Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying: I have slain the LORD'S anointed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and said--To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain! How are the mighty fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of choice fruits; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the pleasant in their lives, even in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan upon thy high places is slain!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; wonderful was thy love to me, passing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
