And the people departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying: 'What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they spoke unto him, saying: 'If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto them: 'What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying: Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spoke unto thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them: My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying: 'Come to me again the third day.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying: '  My father  made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that the LORD might establish His word, which He spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when all Israel  saw  that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying: 'What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to your tents, O Israel; now see to thine own house, David.'
