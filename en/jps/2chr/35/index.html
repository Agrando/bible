Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred  small cattle  , and three hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand  small cattle  , and five hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they killed the passover lamb, and the priests dashed  the blood, which they received  of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they removed the portions that were to be burnt, that they might give them to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the children of the people, to present unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and the holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate; they needed not to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying: 'What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath given command to speed me; forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that He destroy thee not.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco, from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants: 'Have me away; for I am sore wounded.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations, unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel; and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the Law of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
