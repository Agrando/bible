For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying: 'The good LORD pardon</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>every one that setteth his heart to seek God, the LORD, the God of his fathers, though  he be  not  cleansed  according to the purification that pertaineth to holy things.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly unto all the Levites that were well skilled in the service of the LORD. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the whole congregation took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and priests sanctified themselves in great numbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard  of the LORD  , and their prayer came up to His holy habitation, even unto heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
