So they built and prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand; all these were mighty men of valour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephath at Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said: 'LORD, there is none beside Thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength; help us, O LORD our God; for we rely on Thee, and in Thy name are we come against this multitude.
