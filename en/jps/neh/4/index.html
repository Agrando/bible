And he that sounded the horn was by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people: 'The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>in what place soever ye hear the sound of the horn, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So we wrought in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people: 'Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one that went to the water had his weapon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
