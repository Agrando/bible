But they thought to do me mischief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I sent messengers unto them, saying: 'I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down; why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>wherein was written: 'It is reported among the nations, and Geshem    saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall; and thou wouldest be their king, even according to these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judah; and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I sent unto him, saying: 'There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they all would have us afraid, saying: 'Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done.' But now, strengthen Thou my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as for me, I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said: 'Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I said: 'Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me, whereas Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might taunt me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have me put in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
