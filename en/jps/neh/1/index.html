Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the castle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that Hanani, one of my brethren, came out of Judah, he and certain men; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said unto me: 'The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach; the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said: 'I beseech Thee, O LORD, the God of heaven, the great and awful God, that keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>let Thine ear now be attentive, and Thine eyes open, that Thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray before Thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel Thy servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against Thee; yea, I and my father's house have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We have dealt very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which Thou didst command Thy servant Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remember, I beseech Thee, the word that Thou didst command Thy servant Moses, saying: If ye deal treacherously, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if ye return unto Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though your dispersed were in the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause My name to dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now these are Thy servants and Thy people, whom Thou hast redeemed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Lord, I beseech Thee, let now Thine ear be attentive to the prayer of Thy servant, and to the prayer of Thy servants, who delight to fear Thy name; and prosper, I pray Thee, Thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.' Now I was cupbearer to the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
