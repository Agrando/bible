For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we instructed you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you do not grieve like the rest, who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
