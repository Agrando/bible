He sat down, and taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>they told him, "Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about her?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of.But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus, standing up, said to her, "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said, "No one, Lord."Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I came from, or where I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It's also written in your Law that the testimony of two people is valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?"Jesus answered, "You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said therefore again to them, "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you cannot come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Jewish leaders therefore said, "Will he kill himself, that he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said therefore to him, "Who are you?"Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They did not understand that he spoke to them about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I say these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who sent me is with me. The Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spoke these things, many believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus therefore said to those Judeans who had believed him, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, "We are Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, 'You will be made free?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, "Truly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A bondservant does not live in the house forever. A son remains forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have heard from your father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered him, "Our father is Abraham."Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You do the works of your father."They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I have not come of myself, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do you not understand my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you do not hear, because you are not of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the Judeans answered him, "Do not we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then the Judeans said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say 'He is our God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, 'I do not know him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Judeans therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
