Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>about sin, because they do not believe in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you won't see me any more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"I have yet many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine, and will declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and you will no longer see me. Again a little while, and you will see me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, "What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I go to the Father?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore, "What is this that he says, 'A little while?' We do not know what he is saying."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, "Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she does not remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"In that day you will ask me no questions. Truly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came out from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that you know all things, and do not need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came forth from God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
