Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a man does not remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and remain in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"I command these things to you, that you may love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his lord.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they do not know him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who hates me, hates my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
