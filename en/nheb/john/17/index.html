Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While I was with them, I kept them in your name which you have given me; I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Righteous Father, the world hasn't known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
