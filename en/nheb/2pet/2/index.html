Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>suffering the penalty as the wages of evil; people who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>having eyes full of adultery, and who cannot cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but he was rebuked for his own disobedience. A mute donkey spoke with a man's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are wells without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who barely escape from those who live in error;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It has happened to them according to the true proverb, "The dog turns to his own vomit again," and "the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
