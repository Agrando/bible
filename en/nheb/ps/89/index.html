contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite.I will sing of the loving kindness of the Lord forever.With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I indeed declare, "Love stands firm forever.You established the heavens.Your faithfulness is in them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"I have made a covenant with my chosen one,I have sworn to David, my servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>'I will establish your seed forever,and build up your throne to all generations.'"Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The heavens will praise your wonders, Lord;your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,to be feared above all those who are around him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lord, God of Hosts, who is a mighty one, like you?Yah, your faithfulness is around you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You rule the pride of the sea.When its waves rise up, you calm them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The heavens are yours.The earth also is yours;the world and its fullness.You have founded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The north and the south, you have created them.Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You have a mighty arm.Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.Loving kindness and truth go before your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.They walk in the light of your presence, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In your name they rejoice all day.In your righteousness, they are exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you are the glory of their strength.In your favor, our horn will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For our shield belongs to the Lord;our king to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then you spoke in vision to your holy ones,and said, "I have bestowed strength on the warrior.I have exalted a young man from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have found David, my servant.I have anointed him with my holy oil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>with whom my hand shall be established.My arm will also strengthen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No enemy will tax him.No wicked man will oppress him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will beat down his adversaries before him,and strike those who hate him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.In my name, his horn will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I will set his hand also on the sea,and his right hand on the rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He will call to me, 'You are my Father,my God, and the rock of my salvation!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I will also appoint him my firstborn,the highest of the kings of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore.My covenant will stand firm with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will also make his seed endure forever,and his throne as the days of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If his children forsake my Law,and do not walk in my ordinances;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>if they break my statutes,and do not keep my commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>then I will punish their sin with the rod,and their iniquity with stripes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,nor allow my faithfulness to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I will not break my covenant,nor alter what my lips have uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Once have I sworn by my holiness,I will not lie to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>His seed will endure forever,his throne like the sun before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>It will be established forever like the moon,the faithful witness in the sky."Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But you have rejected and spurned.You have been angry with your anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You have renounced the covenant of your servant.You have defiled his crown in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You have broken down all his hedges.You have brought his strongholds to ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>All who pass by the way rob him.He has become a reproach to his neighbors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.You have made all of his enemies rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,and haven't supported him in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You have ended his splendor,and thrown his throne down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You have shortened the days of his youth.You have covered him with shame.Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>How long, Lord?Will you hide yourself forever?Will your wrath burn like fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Remember how short my time is!For what vanity have you created all the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>What man is he who shall live and not see death,who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses,which you swore to David in your faithfulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants,how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>With which your enemies have mocked, Lord,with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Blessed be the Lord forevermore.Amen, and Amen.BOOK IV</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
