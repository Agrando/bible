Yah!Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,for his loving kindness endures forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord,or fully declare all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are those who keep justice.Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, Lord, with the favor that you show to your people.Visit me with your salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,that I may glory with your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers.We have committed iniquity.We have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers did not understand your wonders in Egypt.They did not remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake,that he might make his mighty power known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The waters covered their adversaries.There was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed his words.They sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They soon forgot his works.They did not wait for his counsel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but gave in to craving in the desert,and tested God in the wasteland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He gave them their request,but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They envied Moses also in the camp,and Aaron, the Lord's holy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,and covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A fire was kindled in their company.The flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb,and worshiped a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus they exchanged their gloryfor an image of a bull that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God, their Savior,who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wondrous works in the land of Ham,and awesome things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore he said that he would destroy them,had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, they despised the pleasant land.They did not believe his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but murmured in their tents,and did not listen to the Lord's voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore he swore to themthat he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,and scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.The plague broke in on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment,so the plague was stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That was credited to him for righteousness,for all generations to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they were rebellious against his spirit,he spoke rashly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the peoples,as the Lord commanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but mixed themselves with the nations,and learned their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They served their idols,which became a snare to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They shed innocent blood,even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.The land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus were they defiled with their works,and prostituted themselves in their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore the Lord burned with anger against his people.He abhorred his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He gave them into the hand of the nations.Those who hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies also oppressed them.They were brought into subjection under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times he delivered them,but they were rebellious in their counsel,and were brought low in their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless he regarded their distress,when he heard their cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He remembered for them his covenant,and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He made them also to be pitiedby all those who carried them captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, Lord, our God,gather us from among the nations,to give thanks to your holy name,to triumph in your praise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,from everlasting even to everlasting!Let all the people say, "Amen."Praise the Lord!BOOK V</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
