contemplation by Asaph.Hear my teaching, my people.Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth in a parable.I will utter dark sayings of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>which we have heard and known,and our fathers have told us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not hide them from their children,telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord,his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he established a testimony in Jacob,and appointed a teaching in Israel,which he commanded our fathers,that they should make them known to their children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;who should arise and tell their children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>that they might set their hope in God,and not forget the works of God,but keep his commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and might not be as their fathers,a stubborn and rebellious generation,a generation that did not make their hearts loyal,whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,turned back in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They did not keep God's covenant,and refused to walk by his Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They forgot his doings,his wondrous works that he had shown them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.He made the waters stand as a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,and all night with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He split rocks in the wilderness,and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He brought streams also out of the rock,and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet they still went on to sin against him,to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They tempted God in their heartby asking food according to their desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yes, they spoke against God.They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,and streams overflowed.Can he give bread also?Will he provide flesh for his people?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry.A fire was kindled against Jacob,anger also went up against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>because they did not believe in God,and did not trust in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet he commanded the skies above,and opened the doors of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He rained down manna on them to eat,and gave them bread from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man ate the bread of angels.He sent them food to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.By his power he guided the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He rained also flesh on them as the dust;winged birds as the sand of the seas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He let them fall in the midst of their camp,around their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they ate, and were well filled.He gave them their own desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They did not turn from their cravings.Their food was yet in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>when the anger of God went up against them,killed some of the fattest of them,and struck down the young men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they still sinned,and did not believe in his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,and their years in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he killed them, then they inquired after him.They returned and sought God earnestly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They remembered that God was their rock,the Most High God, their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they flattered him with their mouth,and lied to him with their tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not right with him,neither were they faithful in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and did not destroy them.Yes, many times he turned his anger away,and did not stir up all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He remembered that they were but flesh,a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,and grieved him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They turned again and tempted God,and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They did not remember his hand,nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>how he set his signs in Egypt,his wonders in the field of Zoan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he turned their rivers into blood,and their streams, so that they could not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,and their labor to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail,their sycamore fig trees with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He gave over their livestock also to the hail,and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,wrath, indignation, and trouble,and a band of destroying angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a path for his anger.He did not spare their soul from death,but gave their life over to the pestilence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he led forth his own people like sheep,and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid,but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He also drove out the nations before them,allotted them for an inheritance by line,and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,and did not keep his testimonies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places,and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When God heard this, he was angry,and greatly abhorred Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh,the tent which he placed among men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and delivered his strength into captivity,his glory into the adversary's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He also gave his people over to the sword,and was angry with his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Fire devoured their young men.Their virgins had no wedding song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword,and their widows couldn't weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>He struck his adversaries backward.He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But chose the tribe of Judah,Mount Zion which he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>He built his sanctuary like the heights,like the earth which he has established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He also chose David his servant,and took him from the sheepfolds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>from following the ewes that have their young,he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,and Israel, his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
