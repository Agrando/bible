A Psalm by David.I waited patiently for the Lord.He turned to me, and heard my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,out of the miry clay.He set my feet on a rock,and gave me a firm place to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust,and doesn't respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Many, Lord, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,and your thoughts which are toward us.They can't be declared back to you.If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,but a body you have prepared for me.You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, "Behold, I have come.It is written about me in the book in the scroll.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I delight to do your will, my God.Yes, your Law is within my heart."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.Behold, I will not seal my lips, Lord, you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not withhold your tender mercies from me, Lord.Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For innumerable evils have surrounded me.My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.They are more than the hairs of my head.My heart has failed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be pleased, Lord, to deliver me.Hurry to help me, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it.Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, "Aha! Aha!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.Let such as love your salvation say continually, "Let the Lord be exalted!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But I am poor and needy.May the Lord think about me.You are my help and my deliverer.Do not delay, my God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
