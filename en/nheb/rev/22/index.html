On this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There will no longer be any night, and they need no lamp light; for the Lord God will illuminate them.
