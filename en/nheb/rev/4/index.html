Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the one who sat there looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal.
