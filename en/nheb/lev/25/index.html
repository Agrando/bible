You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"'You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee to you; and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself, nor gather from the undressed vines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you.

They shall not be sold as slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall fear your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"'As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have; of the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you, which they have conceived in your land; and they will be your property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them may you take your slaves forever: but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"'If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member of the stranger's family;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>If he isn't redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee, he, and his children with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt.
