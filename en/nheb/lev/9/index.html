and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today the Lord appears to you.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moses said, "This is the thing which the Lord commanded that you should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the Lord commanded."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned them upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There came forth fire from before the Lord, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
