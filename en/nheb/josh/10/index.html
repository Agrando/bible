Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man of them will stand before you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joshua therefore came on them suddenly. He went up from Gilgal all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Lord confused them before Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, that the Lord cast down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than who the children of Israel killed with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, "Sun, stand still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aijalon!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn't this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of the sky, and did not hurry to go down about a whole day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord listened to the voice of a man; for the Lord fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Joshua was told, saying, "The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joshua said, "Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but do not stay. Pursue your enemies, and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to enter into their cities; for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It happened, when they brought those kings out to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, "Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings."They came near, and put their feet on their necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and of good courage, for the Lord will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It happened at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The Lord delivered it also, with its king, into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining in it. He did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel. He took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls who were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He took it, with its king and all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the Negev, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because the Lord, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
