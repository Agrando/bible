You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. They struck them until they left them none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joshua did to them as the Lord told him. He hamstrung their horses and burnt their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed. He burnt Hazor with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua burned that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The children of Israel took all the spoil of these cities, with the livestock, as spoils for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They did not leave any who breathed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the Lord commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the Lord commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. The land had rest from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
