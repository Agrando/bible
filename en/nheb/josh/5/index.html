The Lord swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land which the Lord swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you." Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel did not have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said, "No; but I have come now as captain of the Lord's host."Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The captain of the Lord's host said to Joshua, "Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy." Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
