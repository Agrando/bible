Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He said to me, "Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you." Then I ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard-hearted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: do not be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover he said to me, "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord God'; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, "Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the anger of my spirit; and the hand of the Lord was strong on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I came to them of the exiles at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It happened at the end of seven days, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I tell the wicked, 'You shall surely die'; and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn't turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Again, when a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The hand of the Lord was there on me; and he said to me, "Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, "Go, shut yourself inside your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But you, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands on you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be mute, and shall not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, 'Thus says the Lord God': He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
