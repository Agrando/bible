Was your prostitution a small matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that you have slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were wallowing in your blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"'It has happened after all your wickedness, ("Woe, woe to you!" says the Lord God),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your ordinary food, and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute with them, and yet you weren't satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren't satisfied with this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"'How weak is your heart, says the Lord God, since you do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"'A wife who commits adultery! who takes strangers instead of her husband!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus says the Lord God, 'Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you gave to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those who you have loved, with all those who you have hated; I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places; and they shall strip you of your clothes, and take your beautiful jewels; and they shall leave you naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute, and you shall also give no hire any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So will I cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"'Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring your way on your head,' says the Lord God: 'and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"'Behold, everyone who uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you, saying, "As is the mother, so is her daughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet have you not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as if that were a very little thing, you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I live,' says the Lord God, 'Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"'Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>They were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous that you: yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>"'I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives in their midst;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who do despite to you all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, says the Lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>"For thus says the Lord God: 'I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then you shall remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your elder sisters and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know that I am the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you have done, says the Lord God.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
