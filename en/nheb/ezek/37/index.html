I answered, "Lord God, you know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he said to me, "Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, 'You dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Lord God to these bones: 'Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the Lord.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, 'Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy, and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people;

and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God: "Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel;

and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children, forever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The nations shall know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in their midst forevermore."'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
