Keep the fortress! Watch the way! Strengthen your waist! Fortify your power mightily!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For the Lord restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the destroyers have destroyed them, and ruined their vine branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The shield of his mighty men is made red. The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The chariots rage in the streets. They rush back and forth in the broad ways. Their appearance is like torches. They run like the lightnings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He summons his picked troops. They stumble on their way.
