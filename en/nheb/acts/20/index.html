As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we landed at Samos, and the day after we came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I make my life an account of nothing precious to myself, so that I may finish my race, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about proclaiming the Kingdom, will see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
