They informed the governor against Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that by your foresight reforms are coming to this nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But, that I do not delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Judeans also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the temple they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the Law, and which are written in the Prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>unless it is for this one thing that I shouted out standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He ordered the centurion that he should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Judeans, Felix left Paul in bonds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
