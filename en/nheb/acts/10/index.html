Why have you come?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he called them in and lodged them. On the next day he arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>On the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up! I myself am also a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them, "You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cornelius said, "Four days ago until this hour, the ninth hour, I was praying in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God does not show favoritism;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming good news of peace by Jesus Christ-he is Lord of all-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>that spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>We are witnesses of everything he did both in the countryside of Judea, and in Jerusalem; whom they also killed, hanging him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God.Then Peter answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
