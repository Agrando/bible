Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom God raised up, having freed him from the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says concerning him,'I saw the Lord always before my face,For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because you will not leave my soul in hell,neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You made known to me the ways of life.You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that one of his descendants would sit on his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Messiah, that neither was he left in hell, nor did his flesh see decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself,'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then those who received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>All who believed were together, and had all things in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
