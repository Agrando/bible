The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to the Lord, were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the Lord had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Her rival taunted her severely, to irritate her, because the Lord had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, so she taunted her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the Lord's temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the Lord, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She vowed a vow, and said, "Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It happened, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli saw her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Eli said to her, "How long will you make yourself drunk? Put away your wine from you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not count your handmaid as a worthless woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my distress and my anguish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered, "Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She said, "Let your handmaid find favor in your sight." So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn't sad any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It happened, when the time had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, "Because I have asked him of the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, "Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and stay there forever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish his word."So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three year old bull, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the Lord's house in Shiloh. The child was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She said, "Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this child I prayed; and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore also I have granted him to the Lord. As long as he lives he is granted to the Lord." He worshiped the Lord there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
