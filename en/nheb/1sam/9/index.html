From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, "Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren't there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to him, "See now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says surely comes to pass. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey on which we have set out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said to his servant, "But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone in our vessels, and there is no gift to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The servant answered Saul again, and said, "Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say, "Come, and let us go to the seer"; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Saul said to his servant, "Well said. Come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, "Is the seer here?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They answered them, and said, "He is. Behold, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As soon as you have come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you shall find him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the Lord had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry has come to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, "Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall have authority over my people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, "Please tell me where the seer's house is."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Samuel answered Saul, and said, "I am he. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them; for they have been found. And for whom does all Israel desire? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Saul answered, "Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I told you to set aside."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. And he said, "Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because for the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, 'I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They arose early: and it happened about daybreak, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, "Get up, that I may send you away." Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, went outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As they were going down at the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead," (and he passed on), "but remain here awhile, that I may make known to you the word of God."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
