Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The children of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry to the Lord our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to the Lord: and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel; and the Lord answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, "The Lord helped us until now."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the territory of Israel. The hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar to the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
