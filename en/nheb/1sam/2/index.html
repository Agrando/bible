The child served the Lord before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the sons of Eli were base men; they did not know the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, "Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires"; then he would say, "No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The sin of the young men was very great before the Lord; for they despised the offering of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, "The Lord give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of the Lord." They went to their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Lord visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, "Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the Lord's people disobey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?" Notwithstanding, they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the Lord intended to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with the Lord, and also with men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, "Thus says the Lord, I plainly revealed myself to the house of your father, when they were slaves in Egypt to the house of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.' But now the Lord says, 'Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You shall see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"'This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, "Please put me into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread."'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
