Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: wouldn't it be better for us to return into Egypt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said one to another, "Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the Lord delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Only do not rebel against the Lord, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is removed from over them, and the Lord is with us. Do not fear them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. The glory of the Lord appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord said to Moses, "How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moses said to the Lord, "Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Lord are in the midst of this people; for you Lord are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>'Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>'The Lord is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Lord said, "I have pardoned according to your word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn, and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that murmur against me?
