Hasn't he spoken also with us?" And the Lord heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, "You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!"The three of them came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said, "Hear now my words. If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see the Lord's form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, please do not count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moses cried to the Lord, saying, "Heal her, God, I beg you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Lord said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn't she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people did not travel until Miriam was brought in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
