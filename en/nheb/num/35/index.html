This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to: and besides them you shall give forty-two cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities together with their suburbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many you shall take many; and from the few you shall take few: everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities to the Levites."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"'But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he shall put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"'But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"'But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer;

and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him who shed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, the Lord, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
