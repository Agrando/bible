You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? and do you seek the priesthood also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the Lord: and Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, "We won't come up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? We won't come up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moses was very angry, and said to the Lord, "Do not respect their offering: I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moses said to Korah, "You and all your company go before the Lord, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and each man take his censer, and put incense on them, and each man bring before the Lord his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They each took his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They fell on their faces, and said, "God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Speak to the congregation, saying, 'Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Moses said, "Hereby you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the Lord hasn't sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if the Lord make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand that these men have despised the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who appertained to Korah, and all their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, "Lest the earth swallow us up!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Fire came forth from the Lord, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire yonder; for they are holy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the Lord; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who isn't of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn incense before the Lord; that he not be as Korah, and as his company: as the Lord spoke to him by Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, "You have killed the Lord's people!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the Tent of Meeting: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!" They fell on their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from the Lord! The plague has begun."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague has begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the plague was stayed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
