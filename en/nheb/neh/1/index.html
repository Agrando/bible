Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They said to me, "The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It happened, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said, "I beg you, Lord, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you.
