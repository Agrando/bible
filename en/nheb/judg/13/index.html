And he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son. And now drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Manoah entreated the Lord, and said, "Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah, her husband, wasn't with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The woman ran quickly, and told her husband, and said to him, "Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to the woman?" He said, "I am."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Manoah said, "Now let your words happen. How shall the child be raised and what is he to do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The angel of the Lord said to Manoah, "Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. All that I have commanded her she is to observe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, "Please, stay a bit longer that we may prepare a young goat for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The angel of the Lord said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I won't eat of your bread. And if you prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to the Lord." For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, "What is your name, that when your words come true we may honor you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the angel of the Lord said to him, "Why do you ask for my name? It is incomprehensible."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took the young goat and a grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord, who works wonders. Then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on, and they fell on their faces to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the angel of the Lord did not appear again to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Manoah said to his wife, :We shall surely die, because we have seen God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his wife said to him, "If the Lord meant to kill us, he wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a grain offering from us, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would he have spoken to us now like this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The woman bore a son, and named him Samson. And the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Spirit of the Lord began to direct him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
