Isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she is? Please take her, instead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Samson said to them, "This time I will be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I harm them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the Philistines said, "Who has done this?" They said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion." The Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Samson said to them, "If you behave like this, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" They said, "We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?"He said to them, "As they did to me, so have I done to them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines."Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They spoke to him, saying, "No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand; but surely we will not kill you." They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and reached down and took it, and struck a thousand men with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It happened, when he had finished speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He was very thirsty, and called on the Lord, and said, "You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And God split the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: therefore its name was called En Hakore, which is in Lehi, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
