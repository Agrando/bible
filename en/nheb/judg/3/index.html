Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the children of Israel cried to the Lord, the Lord raised them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his clothing on his right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret message for you, king."The king said, "Keep silence!" All who stood by him went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, "I have a message from God to you." He arose out of his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, "Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he did not open the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened them, and behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them, "Follow after me; for the Lord has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand." They went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and did not allow a man to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. The land had rest eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad: and he also saved Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
