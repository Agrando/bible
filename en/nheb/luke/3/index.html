Every tree therefore that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The multitudes asked him, "What then must we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them, "He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what must we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said to them, "Collect no more than that which is appointed to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Soldiers also asked him, saying, "What about us? What must we do?"He said to them, "Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Messiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>John answered them all, "I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>whose fan is in his hand, to thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now it happened, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying "You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Eli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Shimei, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the son of John, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>the son of Jesus, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattathah, the son of Nathan, the son of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
