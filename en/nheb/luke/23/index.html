He hoped to see some miracle done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will therefore chastise him and release him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But they all shouted out together, saying, "Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!"-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and placed on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then they will begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The people stood watching. The rulers also scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>An inscription was also written above him: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, "Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to him, "Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said this, he breathed his last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Judeans, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been placed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was placed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
