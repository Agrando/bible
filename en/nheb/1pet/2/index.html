Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, when he was cursed, did not curse back. When he suffered, did not threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by his stripes you were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
