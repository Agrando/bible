in whom, though now you do not see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because it is written, "You shall be holy; for I am holy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead, and gave Him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from a pure heart fervently:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For,"All flesh is like grass,and all it's glory like the flower in the grass.The grass withers, and its flower falls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but the word of the Lord endures forever."This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
