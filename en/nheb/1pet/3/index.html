"Do not fear what they fear, neither be troubled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with humility and fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>having a good conscience; so that when they speak evil against you, they may be put to shame who slander your good manner of life in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you-not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
