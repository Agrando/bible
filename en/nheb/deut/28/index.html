because you did not listen to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder, and on your seed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Because you did not serve the Lord your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the Lord shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron on your neck, until he has destroyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The Lord will bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies;

that also shall not leave you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted, throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which the Lord your God has given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom the Lord your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, The Lord your God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>then the Lord will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cling to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, the Lord will bring them on you, until you are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude; because you did not listen to the voice of the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It shall happen that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so the Lord will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>The Lord will scatter you among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth; and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Among these nations you shall find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot: but the Lord will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning you shall say, "I wish it were evening!" and at evening you shall say, "I wish it were morning!" for the fear of your heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>The Lord will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
