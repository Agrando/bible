Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I gave Gilead to Machir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I commanded you at that time, saying, "The Lord your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>until the Lord gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings: so shall the Lord do to all the kingdoms where you go over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall not fear them; for the Lord your God, he it is who fights for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I begged the Lord at that time, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Lord God, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty acts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and did not listen to me; and the Lord said to me, "Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So we stayed in the valley over against Beth Peor.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
