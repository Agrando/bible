Then I answered, and said, "Amen, Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Lord said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, 'Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they did not obey, nor turn their ear, but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not do them.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord said to me, "A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus says the Lord, 'Behold, I will bring disaster on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry to me, but I will not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore do not pray for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"What has my beloved to do in my house, since she has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? When you do evil, then you rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Lord called your name, "A green olive tree, beautiful with goodly fruit." With the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and its branches are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Lord of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then you showed me their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I did not know that they had devised devices against me, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"But, the Lord of hosts, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the mind, I shall see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, "You shall not prophesy in the name of the Lord, that you not die by our hand;"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, "Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and there shall be no remnant to them: for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
