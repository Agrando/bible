They shall dwell in their own land."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Concerning the prophets: My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the Lord, and because of his holy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. "Their course is evil, and their might is not right;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that none does return from his wickedness: they are all of them become to me as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets: 'Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts, 'Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say continually to those who despise me, "The Lord has said, 'You shall have peace'"; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, "No evil shall come on you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For who has stood in the council of the Lord, that he should perceive and hear his word? Who has marked my word, and heard it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, the storm of the Lord, his wrath, has gone forth. Yes, a whirling storm. It shall burst on the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of the Lord shall not return, until he has executed, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Am I a God at hand,' says the Lord, 'and not a God afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him?' says the Lord. 'Do I not fill heaven and earth?' says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>'I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, "I have dreamed, I have dreamed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat?' says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>'Isn't my word like fire?' says the Lord; 'and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,' says the Lord, 'who steal my words everyone from his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I am against the prophets,' says the Lord, 'who use their tongues, and say, "He says."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,' says the Lord, 'and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I did not send them, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all,' says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>'When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, "What is the burden of the Lord?" Then you shall tell them, "What burden! I will cast you off," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, "The burden of the Lord," I will even punish that man and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>You shall say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, "What has the Lord answered?" and, "What has the Lord spoken?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You shall mention the burden of the Lord no more: for every man's own word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the Lord of hosts our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You shall say to the prophet, "What has the Lord answered you?" and, "What has the Lord spoken?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if you say, "The burden of the Lord"; therefore thus says the Lord: Because you say this word, "The burden of the Lord," and I have sent to you, saying, "You shall not say, 'The burden of the Lord'";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
