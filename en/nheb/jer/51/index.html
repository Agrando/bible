How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The sea has come up on Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land in which no man dwells, neither does any son of man pass thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more to him: yes, the wall of Babylon shall fall."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"My people, go away from the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Do not let your heart faint, neither fear for the news that shall be heard in the land; for news shall come one year, and after that in another year shall come news, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>You who have escaped the sword, go, do not stand still; remember the Lord from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion has covered our faces: for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of the Lord's house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>"Therefore behold, the days come," says the Lord, "that I will execute judgment on her engraved images; and through all her land the wounded shall groan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Though Babylon should mount up to the sky, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall destroyers come to her," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>"The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For the Lord lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>for the destroyer has come on her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for the Lord is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>"I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake up," says the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>and say, 'Lord, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor animal, but that it shall be desolate forever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and you shall say, 'Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they shall be weary.'" Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
