publish, and do not conceal: say, 'Babylon is taken, Bel is disappointed, Merodach is dismayed; her images are disappointed, her idols are dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and animal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In those days, and in that time,' says the Lord, 'the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it, saying, "Come, and join yourselves to the Lord in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, "We are not guilty, because they have sinned against the Lord, the habitation of righteousness, even the Lord, the hope of their fathers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Chaldea shall be a prey: all who prey on her shall be satisfied,' says the Lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain, and neigh as strong horses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>your mother shall be utterly disappointed; she who bore you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because of the wrath of the Lord she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around, all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shout against her all around: she has submitted herself; her towers are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of the Lord: take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people, and they shall flee everyone to his own land."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>'Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In those days, and in that time, says the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: kill and utterly destroy after them," says the Lord, "and do according to all that I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken! How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon, and you weren't aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have striven against the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Lord has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, the Lord of hosts, has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! For their day has come, the time of their visitation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow; encamp against her all around; let none of it escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her; for she has been proud against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Behold, I am against you, you proud one," says the Lord, the Lord of hosts; for your day has come, the time that I will visit you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all who are around him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A sword is on the Chaldeans," says the Lord, "and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is on her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is on her treasures, and they shall be robbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A drought is on her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of engraved images, and they glory over idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it," says the Lord, "so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man live therein."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of him, pains as of a woman in labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? And who will appoint me a time? And who is the shepherd who can stand before me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: "Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles, and the cry is heard among the nations."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
