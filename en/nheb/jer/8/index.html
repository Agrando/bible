Shall one turn away, and not return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I listened and heard, but they did not speak what is right: no man repents him of his wickedness, saying, "What have I done?" Everyone turns to his course, as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yes, the stork in the sky knows her appointed times; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people do not know the Lord's law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How can you say, "We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us?" But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The wise men are disappointed, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what kind of wisdom is in them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to those who shall possess them: for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, "Peace, peace;" when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No! They were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among those who fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will utterly consume them, says the Lord: no grapes shall be on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for the Lord our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles; for they have come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! My heart is faint within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: 'Isn't the Lord in Zion? Isn't her King in her?'" "Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images, and with foreign vanities?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"'The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay has taken hold on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is there no balm in Gilead?
