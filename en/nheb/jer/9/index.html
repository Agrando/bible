For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"They bend their tongue, as their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know me," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Take heed everyone of his neighbor, and do not trust in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will deceive everyone his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, "Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how should I deal with the daughter of my people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lies in wait for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I not visit them for these things?" says the Lord; "shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passes through; neither can men hear the voice of the livestock; both the birds of the sky and the animals are fled, they are gone."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Who is the wise man, that may understand this? Who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passes through?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord says, "Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts, "Consider, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skillful women, that they may come:"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, 'How are we ruined! We are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Yet hear the word of the Lord, you women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and everyone her neighbor lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>'For death has come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from outside, and the young men from the streets.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Speak, 'Thus says the Lord, "The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the handful after the harvester; and none shall gather them."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says the Lord, "Do not let the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, do not let the rich man glory in his riches;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but let him who glories glory in this, that he has understanding, and knows me, that I am the Lord who exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Behold, the days come," says the Lord, "that I will punish all those who are circumcised in uncircumcision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair cut off, who dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
