But they would not listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore you shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, "Every bottle shall be filled with wine:"' and they shall tell you, 'Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then you shall tell them, 'Thus says the Lord, "Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says the Lord. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Hear, and give ear; do not be proud; for the Lord has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Give glory to the Lord your God, before he causes darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride; and my eye shall weep bitterly, and run down with tears, because the Lord's flock is taken captive."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Say to the king and to the queen mother, 'Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headdresses have come down, even the crown of your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The cities toward the south are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Lift up your eyes, and see those who come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What will you say, when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you? Shall not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If you say in your heart, 'Why are these things come on me?' for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>'Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me,' says the Lord; 'because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face, and your shame shall appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, Jerusalem! You will not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
