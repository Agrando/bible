Then Jeremiah said to him, "The Lord has not called your name 'Pashhur,' but 'Magormissabib.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says the Lord, 'Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all the precious things of it, yes, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lord, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocks me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, "Violence and destruction!" because the word of the Lord is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If I say, "I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name," then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I can't contain it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. "Denounce, and we will denounce him," say all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall; "perhaps he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the Lord is with me as an awesome mighty one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly disappointed, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, the Lord of hosts, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing to the Lord, praise the Lord; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed is the day in which I was born: do not let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying, A boy is born to you; making him very glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew, and did not repent: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because he did not kill me from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
