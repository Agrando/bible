Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city all around;) and they went toward the Arabah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he burned the house of the Lord, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned he with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord in pieces, and carried all their bronze to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of the Lord. The brass of all these vessels was without weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers.

Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
