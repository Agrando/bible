For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first,' says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: 'Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them,' says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>'Behold, the days come,' says the Lord, 'that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name by which she shall be called: "The Lord our righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus says the Lord: "David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Thus says the Lord: 'If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the army of the sky can't be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites who minister to me.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Do not consider what this people has spoken, saying, 'The two families which the Lord chose, he has cast them off?' Thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus says the Lord: 'If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
