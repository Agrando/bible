Yet you, Lord, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; do not leave us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says the Lord to this people, "Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore the Lord does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord said to me, "Do not pray for this people for their good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I said, "Ah, Lord God! Behold, the prophets tell them, 'You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Lord said to me, "The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I did not send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I did not send them, yet they say, 'Sword and famine shall not be in this land:' 'By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"You shall say this word to them, 'Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! For both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Have you utterly rejected Judah? Has your soul loathed Zion? Why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, Lord, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not abhor us, for your name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, do not break your covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? Or can the sky give showers? Aren't you he, Lord our God? Therefore we will wait for you; for you have made all these things."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
