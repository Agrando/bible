Or what is our iniquity? Or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then you shall tell them, 'Because your fathers have forsaken me, says the Lord, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and you have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you do not listen to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore behold, the days come," says the Lord, "that it shall no more be said, 'As the Lord lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but, 'As the Lord lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had driven them.' I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishermen," says the Lord, "and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Lord, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, 'Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, vanity and things in which there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Therefore behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
