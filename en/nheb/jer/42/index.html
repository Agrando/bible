for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes do see us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>that the Lord your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you; behold, I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words; and it shall happen that whatever thing the Lord shall answer you, I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then they said to Jeremiah, "The Lord be a true and faithful witness among us, if we do not do according to all the word with which the Lord your God shall send you to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the Lord our God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It happened after ten days, that the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and said to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>'If you will still live in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not be afraid of him, says the Lord: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if you say, 'We will not dwell in this land'; so that you do not obey the voice of the Lord your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying, 'No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell':</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>now therefore hear the word of the Lord, O remnant of Judah: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, 'If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to live there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then it shall happen, that the sword, which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, shall follow close behind you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: 'As my anger and my wrath has been poured forth on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth on you, when you shall enter into Egypt; and you shall be an object of horror, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, 'Do not go into Egypt': know certainly that I have testified to you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to the Lord your God, saying, 'Pray for us to the Lord our God; and according to all that the Lord our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it':</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God in anything for which he has sent me to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you desire to go to live there."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
