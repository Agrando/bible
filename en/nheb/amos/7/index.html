How could Jacob stand? For he is small."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The Lord relented concerning this. "It shall not be," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus the Lord God showed me and behold, the Lord God called for judgment by fire; and it dried up the great deep, and would have devoured the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I said, "Lord God, stop, I beg you!
