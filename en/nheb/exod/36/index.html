They brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They spoke to Moses, saying, "The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded to make."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, they made them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling. Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling.

He made it the work of a skillful workman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold. He cast four sockets of silver for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the five pillars of it with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold, and their five sockets were of brass.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
