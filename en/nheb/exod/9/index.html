But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the Lord had spoken to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For now I would have put forth my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter.
