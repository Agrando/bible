Be made clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to him, "I will come and heal him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the centurion answered, "Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, "Truly I tell you, I have not found so great a faith with anyone in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but the sons of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed." And his servant was healed in that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then a scribe came, and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They came to him, and woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord! We are dying!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he came to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And behold, they shouted, saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, "Go!"And they came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
