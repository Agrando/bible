What therefore God has joined together, do not let man tear apart."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce, and divorce her?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples said to him, "If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, "Allow the little children, and do not forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He placed his hands on them, and departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, one came to him and said, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? No one is good but one. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him, "Which ones?"Jesus said, "'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false testimony.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>'Honor your father and mother.' And, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to him, "All these things I have observed. What do I still lack?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Looking at them, Jesus said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter answered, "Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
