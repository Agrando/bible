The bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise answered, saying, 'What if there is not enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he answered, 'Truly I tell you, I do not know you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"For it is like a man, going on a journey, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Immediately the one who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In like manner he who got the two gained another two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"He also who got the two talents came and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"He also who had received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"But his lord answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the King will tell those on his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"The King will answer them, 'Truly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for I was hungry, and you did not give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger, and you did not take me in; naked, and you did not clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Then they will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly I tell you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
