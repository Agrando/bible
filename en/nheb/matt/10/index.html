The first, Simon, who is called Peter; and Andrew his brother; and Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as you go, proclaim, saying, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is near!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as you enter into the household, greet it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whoever does not receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But beware of people: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father's will,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore do not be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whoever denies me before people, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Do not think that I came to send peace on the earth. I did not come to send peace, but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And a man's foes will be those of his own household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And whoever does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. He who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, truly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
