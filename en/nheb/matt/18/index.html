For there will always be something to cause people to stumble, but woe to the person through whom the stumbling block comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life crippled or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. [</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Son of Man came to save what was lost.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does not he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he does not listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. If he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, truly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter came to him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, "I do not tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But because he could not pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"So his fellow servant fell down and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord called him in, and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Should not you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you do not each forgive your brother from your heart."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
