First remove the log out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or who is there among you, who, if his son will ask him for bread, will give him a stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or if he will ask for a fish, who will give him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How narrow is the gate, and difficult is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that does not grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did not we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, will be compared to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And everyone who hears these words of mine, and does not do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell-and great was its fall."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he taught them with authority, and not like their scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
