He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Herod had arrested John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And she, being prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then his disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a secluded place to be alone. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went out, and he saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when evening had come, the disciples came to him, saying, "This place is desolate, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they told him, "We only have here five loaves and two fish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he said, "Bring them here to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It's a ghost!" and they screamed with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But immediately he spoke to them, saying "Cheer up! It is I! Do not be afraid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said, "Come!"Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he yelled, saying, "Lord, save me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, "You are truly the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
