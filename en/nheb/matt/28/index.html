Come, see the place where he was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jewish people, and continues until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
