A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is the one of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance. We sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her actions."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to hell. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time, Jesus answered, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
