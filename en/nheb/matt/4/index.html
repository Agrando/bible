He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will put his angels in charge of you.' and,'On their hands they will bear you up,so that you do not dash your foot against a stone.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not test the Lord, your God.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to him, "I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, andto those who sat in the region and shadow of death,to them light has dawned."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From that time, Jesus began to proclaim, and to say, "Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is near."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they immediately left their nets and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the report about him went out into all Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And great multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
