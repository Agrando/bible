Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that no one should say that you had been baptized into my own name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I do not know whether I baptized any other.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to proclaim the Good News-not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written,"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the Law scholar of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the proclaiming to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we proclaim Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that no flesh should boast before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that, according as it is written, "He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
