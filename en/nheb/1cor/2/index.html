For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But as it is written,"Things which an eye did not see, and an ear did not hear,which did not enter into the heart of man,these God has prepared for those who love him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the natural man does not receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have Christ's mind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
