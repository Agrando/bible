Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he does not yet know as he ought to know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For though there are things that are called "gods," whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many "gods" and many "lords;"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However, that knowledge is not in all men. But some, being so accustomed to idols until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we do not eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whom the Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I do not cause my brother to stumble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
