Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But now faith, hope, and love remain-these three. The greatest of these is love.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
