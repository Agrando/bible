But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let all that you do be done in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The churches of Asia greet you.
