For you would be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none is without meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then I do not know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the "Amen" at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not know what you say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you truly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God, I speak with other languages more than you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, do not be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, "By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore the whole church is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church, and let him speak to himself, and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>let the women keep silent in the churches, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the Law also says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if someone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking with other languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
