Indeed, not even now are you ready,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, are not you fleshly, and do you not walk in the ways of men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are not you men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's farming, God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>each man's work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He has taken the wise in their craftiness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again, "The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
