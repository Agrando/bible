No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," but by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the one Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink of one Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the body is not one member, but many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If the foot would say, "Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body," it is not therefore not part of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If the ear would say, "Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body," it's not therefore not part of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If they were all one member, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now they are many members, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The eye cannot tell the hand, "I have no need for you," or again the head to the feet, "I have no need for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God has set some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But earnestly desire the greater gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
