It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?" It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That which is crooked can't be made straight; and that which is lacking can't be counted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
