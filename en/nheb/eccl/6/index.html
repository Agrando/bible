This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn child is better than he:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it.
