And he understood the word, and had understanding of the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three whole weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I had no pleasing food, neither meat nor wine came into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is the Tigris,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, around his waist a belt made of pure gold from Uphaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>His body was like beryl, and his face like the appearance of lightning, and his eyes like flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great trembling fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my natural appearance grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yet I heard the sound of his words, and when I heard the sound of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to me, "Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright; for I have now been sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he to me, "Do not be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. And I have come because of your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was left there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days; for the vision refers to future days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground, and could not speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, one in the likeness of a human touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, "My lord, it is because of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how can this servant of my lord talk with my lord? As for me, no strength remains, and I am breathless."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then one like the appearance of a man touched me again and strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, "Greatly loved man, do not be afraid, peace be to you; be strong, be strong!"When he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I go forth, behold, the prince of Greece shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will tell you that which is inscribed in the Book of Truth. And there is no one who contends with me against them except Michael, your prince."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
