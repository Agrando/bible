So would you endanger my head with the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Test your servants for ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then let our faces be looked on before you, and the face of the youths who eat of the king's royal food; and as you see, deal with your servants."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them ten days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At the end of ten days their faces appeared better and fatter than all the youths who ate of the king's royal food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the steward took away their royal food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them vegetables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The king talked with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore they entered the king's service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
