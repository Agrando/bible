Then he wrote the dream and told the summary of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Daniel spoke and said, "I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Four great animals came up from the sea, different from one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings. I saw until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man; and a man's mind was given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold, another animal, a second one, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And they said this to it, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After this I saw, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The animal also had four heads; and dominion was given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and extremely strong. And it had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet. And it was diverse from all the animals that were before it; and it had ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking arrogant things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I saw until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool. His throne was fiery flames, and its wheels burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him. Thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I saw at that time because of the voice of the arrogant words which the horn spoke. I was watching until the animal was killed and its body destroyed and was given to be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my mind troubled me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the true meaning concerning all this. So he told me, and revealed to me the interpretation of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall arise out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I desired to know the true meaning concerning the fourth animal, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its claws of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogant things, whose look was larger than the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I saw, and the same horn made war with the holy ones, and prevailed against them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High, and the time came that the holy ones possessed the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This he said, 'The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise, and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall oppress the holy ones of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given over to him until a time and times and half a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the court shall sit in judgment, and they shall take away his dominion, consumed and completely destroyed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and my face turned pale. I kept the matter to myself."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
