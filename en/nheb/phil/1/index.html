Only that in every way, whether out of false motives or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I do not make known what I will choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
