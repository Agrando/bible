Again I will say, Rejoice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However you did well that you shared in my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I have all things, and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar's household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
