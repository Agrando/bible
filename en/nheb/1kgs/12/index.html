My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king did not listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of the Lord, that he might establish his word, which the Lord spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, "What portion have we in David? Neither do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David." So Israel departed to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>'Thus says the Lord, "You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers, the children of Israel. Everyone return to his house; for this thing is of me."'" So they listened to the word of the Lord, and returned and went their way, according to the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived in it; and he went out from there, and built Penuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeroboam said in his heart, "Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look and see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; he did so in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
