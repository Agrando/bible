As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>However the Lord, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of all my sons (for the Lord has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the Lord's kingdom over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to me, 'Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will establish his kingdom forever, if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the Lord your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take heed now; for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary.
