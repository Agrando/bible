But, my lord the king, aren't they all my lord's servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David said to God, "I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Go and speak to David, saying, 'Thus says the Lord, "I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Gad came to David, and said to him, "Thus says the Lord, 'Take your choice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of the Lord, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>David said to Gad, "I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are very great. Let me not fall into the hand of man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, the Lord saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, "It is enough; now stay your hand." The angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David said to God, "Isn't it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Lord my God, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up, and raise an altar to the Lord in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David said to Ornan, "Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to the Lord. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ornan said to David, "Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>King David said to Ornan, "No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for the Lord, nor offer a burnt offering without cost."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>David built an altar to the Lord there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the Lord; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The Lord commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But David couldn't go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
