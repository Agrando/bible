I will therefore make preparation for it." So David prepared abundantly before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for the Lord, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>David said to Solomon his son, "As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the Lord my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 'You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, my son, may the Lord be with you and prosper you, and build the house of the Lord your God, as he has spoken concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May the Lord give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which the Lord gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong, and courageous. Do not be afraid, neither be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of the Lord one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance.

Arise and be doing, and may the Lord be with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Isn't the Lord your God with you? Hasn't he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now set your heart and your soul to seek after the Lord your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
