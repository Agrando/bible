I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that the Lord will build you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne shall be established forever."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then David the king went in, and sat before the Lord; and he said, "Who am I, Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lord, for your servant's sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make known all these great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Lord, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For your people Israel you made your own people forever; and you, Lord, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, Lord, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, 'The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now, Lord, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord, have blessed, and it is blessed forever."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
