For this cause the world does not know us, because it did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. We know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoever remains in him does not sin. Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whoever is born of God does not commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever does not do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who does not love his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love remains in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, let us not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And by this we will know that we are of the truth, and persuade our heart before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness toward God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
