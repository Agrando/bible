Jerusalem shall be called 'The City of Truth;' and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, 'The Holy Mountain.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "Old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes?" says the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and I will bring them, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For before those days there was no wages for man, nor any wages for an animal; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men everyone against his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days," says the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not be afraid. Let your hands be strong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thus says the Lord of hosts: "As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath," says the Lord of hosts, "and I did not repent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The word of the Lord of hosts came to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "The fasts of the fourth fifth, seventh, and tenth months shall be for the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "Many peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the inhabitants of one shall go to another, saying, 'Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts. I will go also.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says the Lord of hosts: "In those days, ten men will take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they will take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, 'We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
