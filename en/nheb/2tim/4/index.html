I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be diligent to come to me soon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
