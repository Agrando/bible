Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"Who is this who darkens counselby words without knowledge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Brace yourself like a man,for I will question you, then you answer me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?Declare, if you have understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who determined its measures, if you know?Or who stretched the line on it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whereupon were its foundations fastened?Or who laid its cornerstone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>when the morning stars sang together,and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Or who shut up the sea with doors,when it broke forth from the womb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>when I made clouds its garment,and wrapped it in thick darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>marked out for it my bound,set bars and doors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and said, 'Here you may come, but no further.Here your proud waves shall be stayed?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Have you commanded the morning in your days,and caused the dawn to know its place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>that it might take hold of the ends of the earth,and shake the wicked out of it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It is changed as clay under the seal,and stands forth as a garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From the wicked, their light is withheld.The high arm is broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Have you entered into the springs of the sea?Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have the gates of death been revealed to you?Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Have you comprehended the earth in its breadth?Declare, if you know it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"What is the way to the dwelling of light?As for darkness, where is its place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that you should take it to its bound,that you should discern the paths to its house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Surely you know, for you were born then,and the number of your days is great!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Have you entered the treasuries of the snow,or have you seen the treasures of the hail,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>which I have reserved against the time of trouble,against the day of battle and war?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By what way is the lightning distributed,or the east wind scattered on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who has cut a channel for the flood water,or the path for the thunderstorm;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To cause it to rain on a land where no man is;on the wilderness, in which there is no man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to satisfy the waste and desolate ground,to cause the tender grass to spring forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Does the rain have a father?Or who fathers the drops of dew?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Out of whose womb came the ice?The gray frost of the sky, who has given birth to it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The waters become hard like stone,when the surface of the deep is frozen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,or loosen the cords of Orion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can you lead forth the constellations in their season?Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do you know the laws of the heavens?Can you establish its dominion over the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,That abundance of waters may cover you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go?Do they report to you, 'Here we are?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?Or who has given understanding to the mind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Who can number the clouds by wisdom?Or who can pour out the bottles of the sky,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>when the dust runs into a mass,and the clods of earth stick together?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"Can you hunt the prey for the lioness,or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>when they crouch in their dens,and lie in wait in the thicket?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Who provides for the raven his prey,when his young ones cry to God,and wander for lack of food?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
