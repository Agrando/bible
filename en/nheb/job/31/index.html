covenant with my eyes,how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For what is the portion from God above,and the heritage from the Almighty on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it not calamity for the unrighteous,and disaster for the workers of iniquity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Doesn't he see my ways,and number all my steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"If I have walked with falsehood,and my foot has hurried to deceit</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>(let me be weighed in an even balance,that God may know my integrity);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>if my step has turned out of the way,if my heart walked after my eyes,if any defilement has stuck to my hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>then let me sow, and let another eat.Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"If my heart has been enticed to a woman,and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>then let my wife grind for another,and let others sleep with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For that would be a heinous crime.Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is a fire that consumes to destruction,and would root out all my increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"If I have despised the cause of my male servantor of my female servant,when they contended with me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What then shall I do when God rises up?When he visits, what shall I answer him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Did not he who made me in the womb make him?Did not the same one fashion us in the womb?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"If I have withheld the poor from their desire,or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>or have eaten my morsel alone,and the fatherless has not eaten of it</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,her have I guided from my mother's womb);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,or that the needy had no covering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>if his heart hasn't blessed me,if he hasn't been warmed with my sheep's fleece;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,because I saw my help in the gate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade,and my arm be broken from the bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For calamity from God is a terror to me.Because his majesty, I can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"If I have made gold my hope,and have said to the fine gold, 'You are my confidence;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,and because my hand had gotten much;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>if I have seen the sun when it shined,or the moon moving in splendor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and my heart has been secretly enticed,and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;for I should have denied the God who is above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,or lifted up myself when evil found him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>(yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sinby asking his life with a curse);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>if the men of my tent have not said,'Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(the foreigner has not lodged in the street,but I have opened my doors to the traveler);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>if like Adam I have covered my transgressions,by hiding my iniquity in my heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>because I feared the great multitude,and the contempt of families terrified me,so that I kept silence, and did not go out of the door-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>oh that I had one to hear me!(behold, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me);let the accuser write my indictment!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;and I would bind it to me as a crown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I would declare to him the number of my steps;as a prince would I go near to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If my land cries out against me,and its furrows weep together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>if I have eaten its fruits without money,or have caused its owners to lose their life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>let briars grow instead of wheat,and stinkweed instead of barley."The words of Job are ended.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
