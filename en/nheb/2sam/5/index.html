The Lord said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, "Unless you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here"; thinking, "David can't come in here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David said on that day, "Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and strike the lame and the blind, who are hated by David's soul." Therefore they say, "The blind and the lame can't come into the house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built around from Millo and inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>David grew greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of Hosts, was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>David inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?"The Lord said to David, "Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, "The Lord has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters." Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When David inquired of the Lord, he said, "You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them over against the mulberry trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall stir yourself up; for then the Lord has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>David did so, as the Lord commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
