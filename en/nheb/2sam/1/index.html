Please tell me."He answered, "The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The young man who told him said, "As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, 'Here I am.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to me, 'Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>David said to the young man who told him, "Where are you from?"He answered, "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David said to him, "How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>David called one of the young men, and said, "Go near, and fall on him." He struck him, so that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David said to him, "Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have slain the Lord's anointed.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!How the mighty have fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not tell it in Gath.Do not publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You mountains of Gilboa,let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings;For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain,from the fat of the mighty,Jonathan's bow did not turn back.Saul's sword did not return empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.In their death, they were not divided.They were swifter than eagles.They were stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,who clothed you in scarlet delicately,who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!Jonathan is slain on your high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.You have been very pleasant to me.Your love to me was wonderful,passing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How are the mighty fallen,and the weapons of war perished!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
