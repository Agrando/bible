I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover the Lord tells you that the Lord will make you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then David the king went in, and sat before the Lord; and he said, "Who am I, Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord God; but you have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come; and this after the way of men, Lord God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore you are great, Lord God. For there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You established for yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Lord, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, Lord God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let your name be magnified forever, saying, 'The Lord of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David shall be established before you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For you, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house.' Therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Now, O Lord God, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord God, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
