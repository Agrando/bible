they have become her enemies.GIMEL</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Judah has gone into exile because of affliction and harsh servitude;she dwells among the nations, she finds no rest:all her persecutors overtook her in the midst of her distress.DALET</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The roads to Zion mourn, because no one comes to the solemn assembly;all her gates are desolate, her priests groan:her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.HEY</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Her adversaries have become the head, her enemies prosper;for the Lord has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.VAV</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion:her leaders have become like deer that find no pasture,they fled exhausted before the pursuer.ZAYIN</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and wandering all her precious things that were from the days of old:when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and no one helped her.The adversaries saw her, they mocked at her desolations.HET</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she has become as an unclean thing;all who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:yes, she groans, and turns away.TET</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Her filthiness was in her skirts; she did not remember her latter end;therefore her fall was astonishing; she has no comforter."Look, Lord, on my affliction, for the enemy has magnified himself."YOD</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The adversary has spread out his hand on all her precious things:for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary,concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.KAPH</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All her people sigh, they seek bread;they have given their precious things for food to refresh the soul."Look, Lord, and see, for I am despised."LAMED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought on me,with which the Lord has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.MEM</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it overcame them.He has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back.He has made me desolate and faint all the day.NUN</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My transgressions are bound into a yoke; by his handthey are fastened together, they are set upon my neck; he has made my strength to fail.The Lord has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.SAMEKH</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord has rejected all my mighty men in my midst;he has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men.The Lord has trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.AYIN</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For these things I weep; my eyes, my eyes flow with tears;because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me.My children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.PEY</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Zion spreads forth her hands; there is none to comfort her.The Lord has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are around him should be his adversaries.Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.TZADE</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord is righteous, for I have rebelled against his commandment.Please listen all you people, and see my suffering.My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.QOPH</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me.My priests and my elders perished in the city,while they searched for food to refresh their souls.RESH</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>See, Lord, for I am in distress; my stomach churns;my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled.Outside the sword bereaves, inside there is death.SHIN</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have heard that I groan; there is none to comfort me.All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it.Bring the day that you have proclaimed, so that they shall end up like me.TAV</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let all their wickedness come before you.Do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions.For my groans are many, and my heart is faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
