He may turn and relent,and leave a blessing behind him,even a meal offering and a drink offering to the Lord, your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blow the trumpet in Zion!Sanctify a fast.Call a solemn assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gather the people.Sanctify the assembly.Assemble the elders.Gather the children, and those who suck the breasts.Let the bridegroom go forth from his room,and the bride out of her chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar,and let them say, "Spare your people, Lord,and do not give your heritage to reproach,that the nations should rule over them.Why should they say among the peoples,'Where is their God?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Lord was jealous for his land,And had pity on his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord answered his people,"Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,and you will be satisfied with them;and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I will remove the northern army far away from you,and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,its front into the eastern sea,and its back into the western sea;and its stench will come up,and its bad smell will rise."Surely he has done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Land, do not be afraid.Be glad and rejoice, for the Lord has done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do not be afraid, you animals of the field;for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,for the tree bears its fruit.The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Be glad then, you children of Zion,and rejoice in the Lord, your God;for he gives you the former rain in just measure,and he causes the rain to come down for you,the former rain and the latter rain,as before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The threshing floors will be full of wheat,and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,my great army, which I sent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied,and will praise the name of the Lord, your God,who has dealt wondrously with you;and my people will never again be disappointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You will know that I am in the midst of Israel,and that I am the Lord, your God, and there is no one else;and my people will never again be disappointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.Your old men will dream dreams.Your young men will see visions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,I will pour out my Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun will be turned into darkness,and the moon into blood,before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It will happen that whoever will call on the name of the Lord shall be saved;for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,as the Lord has said,and among the remnant, those whom the Lord calls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
