You did me no wrong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously seek you, but for no good purpose; they desire to alienate you, that you may be zealous for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written,"Rejoice, you barren who do not bear.Break forth and shout, you that do not travail.For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now you, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>However what does the Scripture say? "Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
