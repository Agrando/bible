(that is, to bring Christ down);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;" that is, the word of faith, which we proclaim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a proclaimer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how will they proclaim unless they are sent? As it is written:"How beautiful are the feet of thosewho bring glad tidings of good things!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they did not all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, did they not hear? Yes, truly,"Their sound went out into all the earth,their words to the ends of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I ask, did not Israel know? First Moses says,"I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Isaiah is very bold, and says,"I was found by those who did not seek me.I was revealed to those who did not ask for me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as to Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
