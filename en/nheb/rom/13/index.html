Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God's service, attending continually on this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Give therefore to everyone what you owe: taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," "You shall not covet," and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love does not harm a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let us therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
