May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God did not reject his people, which he foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But how does God answer him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he did not obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>David says,"Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.Bow down their back always."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I do not desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written,"There will come out of Zion the Deliverer,and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is my covenant to them,when I will take away their sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"For who has known the mind of the Lord?Or who has been his counselor?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Or who has first given to him,and it will be repaid to him again?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
