For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who "will pay back to everyone according to their works:"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but to those who are self-seeking, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For there is no partiality with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(for when Gentiles who do not have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if you call yourself a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You therefore who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who proclaim that a man should not steal, do you steal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You who say a man should not commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," just as it is written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
