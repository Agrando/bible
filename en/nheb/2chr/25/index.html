God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to overthrow."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Amaziah said to the man of God, "But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?"The man of God answered, "The Lord is able to give you much more than this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it happened, after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, "Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It happened, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, "Have we made you one of the king's counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?"Then the prophet stopped, and said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as his wife; then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judah was defeated by Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God's house with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren't they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
