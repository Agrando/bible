For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, "May the good Lord pardon everyone</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who sets his heart to seek God, the Lord, the God of his fathers, even if they aren't clean according to the purification of the sanctuary."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Lord listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with loud instruments to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of the Lord. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to the Lord, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept another seven days with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
