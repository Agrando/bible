Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, "Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the Lord your God, therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Weren't the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? Yet, because you relied on the Lord, he delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the eyes of the Lord run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly; for from henceforth you shall have wars."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he did not seek the Lord, but to the physicians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They buried him in his own tombs, which he had dug out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers' art: and they made a very great burning for him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
