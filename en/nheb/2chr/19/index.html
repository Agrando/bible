Because of this, wrath is on you from before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the Lord, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and said to the judges, "Consider what you do: for you do not judge for man, but for the Lord; and he is with you in the judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore let the fear of the Lord be on you.

Do this, and you shall not be guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and may the Lord be with the good."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
