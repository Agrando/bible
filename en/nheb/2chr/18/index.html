Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?"He answered him, "I am as you are, and my people as your people. We will be with you in the war."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire first for the word of the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"They said, "Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we may inquire of him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla."Jehoshaphat said, "Do not let the king say so."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, "Get Micaiah the son of Imla quickly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, "Thus says the Lord, 'With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All the prophets prophesied so, saying, "Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Micaiah said, "As the Lord lives, what my God says, that will I speak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"He said, "Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. The Lord said, 'These have no master. Let them return every man to his house in peace.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord said, 'Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?' One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A spirit came out, stood before the Lord, and said, 'I will entice him.'"The Lord said to him, 'How?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"He said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.'"He said, 'You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go forth, and do so.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and the Lord has pronounced disaster concerning you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, "Which way did the Spirit of the Lord go from me to speak to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Micaiah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner room to hide yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Micaiah said, "If you return at all in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me." He said, "Listen, you peoples, all of you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, "Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, "It is the king of Israel!" Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, "Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The battle increased that day. However the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening; and about the time of the going down of the sun, he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
