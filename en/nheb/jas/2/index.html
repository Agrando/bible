Did not God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not commit murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you tells them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;" and yet you did not give them the things the body needs, what good is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, a man will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But do you want to know, foolish man, that faith apart from works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;" and he was called the friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
