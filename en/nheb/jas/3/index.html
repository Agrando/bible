If anyone does not stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now if we put bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us, we guide their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Nor is salt water able to produce sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and do not lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
