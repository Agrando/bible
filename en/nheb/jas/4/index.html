Do not they come from your pleasures that war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You lust, and do not have. You kill, covet, and cannot obtain. You fight and make war. You do not have, because you do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask, and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit which He made to dwell in us yearns jealously"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But He gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Only one is the lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow let us go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whereas you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To him therefore who knows to do good, and does not do it, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
