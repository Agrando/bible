"At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For indeed he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves.
