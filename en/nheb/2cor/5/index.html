Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, new things have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
