But I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I do not know, or whether out of the body, I do not know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I do not know; God knows),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become foolish. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the churches, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not what is yours, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Did not we walk in the same spirit? Did not we walk in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you been thinking all this time that we have been defending ourselves before you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ; and all things, beloved, are for your edifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you do not desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
