Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly.
