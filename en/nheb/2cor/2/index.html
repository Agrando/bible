For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I had no relief for my spirit, because I did not find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
