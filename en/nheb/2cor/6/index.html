Behold, now is the day of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians.
