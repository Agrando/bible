Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>One called to another, and said,"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts!The whole earth is full of his glory!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I said, "Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He touched my mouth with it, and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I heard the Lord's voice, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?"Then I said, "Here I am.
