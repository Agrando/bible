I was near to those who did not seek me. I said, 'Here I am! Here I am!' to a nation that did not call on my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have spread out my hands all the day to a disobedient and obstinate people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat pig's flesh, and the broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who say, Stand by yourself, do not come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together," says the Lord, "who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus says the Lord,"As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, 'Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it:' so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"But you who forsake the Lord, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says the Lord God, "Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be disappointed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord God will kill you; and he will call his servants by another name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food.
