I am warm. I have seen the fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The rest of it he makes into a god,even his engraved image.He bows down to it and worships,and prays to it, and says, "Deliver me; for you are my god!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They do not know, neither do they consider:for he has shut their eyes, that they can't see;and their hearts, that they can't understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>No one thinks,neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,"I have burned part of it in the fire.Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals.I have roasted meat and eaten it.Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He feeds on ashes.A deceived heart has turned him aside;and he can't deliver his soul,nor say, "Isn't there a lie in my right hand?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Remember these things, Jacob and Israel;for you are my servant.I have formed you.You are my servant.Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions,and, as a cloud, your sins.Return to me, for I have redeemed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sing, you heavens, for the Lord has done it!Shout, you lower parts of the earth!Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees,for the Lord has redeemed Jacob,and will glorify himself in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer,and he who formed you from the womb:"I am the Lord, who makes all things;who alone stretches out the heavens;who spreads out the earth by myself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who foils the omens of the empty talkers,and makes fools of diviners;who turns wise men backward,and makes their knowledge foolish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>who confirms the word of his servant,and performs the counsel of his messengers;who says of Jerusalem, 'She will be inhabited;'and of the cities of Judah, 'They will be built,'and 'I will raise up its waste places;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who says to the deep, 'Be dry,'and 'I will dry up your rivers;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,'even saying of Jerusalem, 'She will be built;'and of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
