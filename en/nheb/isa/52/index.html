Arise, sit up, Jerusalem! Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For thus says the Lord, "You were sold for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without money."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says the Lord God, "My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there: and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Now therefore, what do I do here," says the Lord, "seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them mock," says the Lord, "and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks; behold, it is I."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The voice of your watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord returns to Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Lord has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Depart, depart, go out from there, touch no unclean thing! Go out of the midst of her! Cleanse yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight: for the Lord will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Just as many were astonished at you (his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
