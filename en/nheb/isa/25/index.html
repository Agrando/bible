I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It will never be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In this mountain, the Lord of hosts will make all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of choice wines, of fat things full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He has swallowed up death forever!
