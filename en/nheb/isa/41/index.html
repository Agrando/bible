silent before me, islands,and let the peoples renew their strength.Let them come near,then let them speak.Let's meet together for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who has raised up one from the east?Whom he called to his foot in righteousness?He hands over nations to him,and makes him rule over kings.He gives them like the dust to his sword,like the driven stubble to his bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He pursues them,and passes by safely,Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who has worked and done it,calling the generations from the beginning?I, the Lord, the first, and with the last, I am he."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The islands have seen, and fear.The ends of the earth tremble.They approach, and come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Everyone helps his neighbor.They say to their brothers, "Be strong!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.He who smoothes with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,saying of the soldering, "It is good;"and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"But you, Israel, my servant,Jacob whom I have chosen,the seed of Abraham my friend,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,and called from its corners,and said to you, 'You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you away;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not be afraid, for I am with you.Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.I will strengthen you.Yes, I will help you.Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded.Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You will seek them, and won't find them,even those who contend with you.Those who war against you will be as nothing,as a non-existent thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand,saying to you, 'Do not be afraid.I will help you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob,and you men of Israel.I will help you," says the Lord,"and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth.You will thresh the mountains,and beat them small,and will make the hills like chaff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will winnow them,and the wind will carry them away,and the whirlwind will scatter them.You will rejoice in the Lord.You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.Their tongue fails for thirst.I, the Lord, will answer them.I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will open rivers on the bare heights,and springs in the midst of the valleys.I will make the wilderness a pool of water,and the dry land springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.I will set fir trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,that the hand of the Lord has done this,and the Holy One of Israel has created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Produce your cause," says the Lord."Bring forth your strong reasons," says the King of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Let them announce, and declare to us what shall happen.Declare the former things, what they are,that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them;or show us things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Declare the things that are to come hereafter,that we may know that you are gods.Yes, do good, or do evil,that we may be dismayed,and see it together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, you are of nothing,and your work is of nothing.He who chooses you is an abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"I have raised up one from the north, and he has come;from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name;and he shall come on rulers as on mortar,and as the potter treads clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?And before, that we may say, 'He is right?'Surely, there is no one who declares.Surely, there is no one who shows.Surely, there is no one who hears your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I am the first to say to Zion, 'Behold, look at them;'and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When I look, there is no man;even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing.Their molten images are wind and confusion.</span>
