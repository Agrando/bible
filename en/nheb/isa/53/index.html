Everyone has turned to his own way;and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He was oppressed,yet when he was afflicted he did not open his mouth.As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute,so he did not open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was taken away by oppression and judgment;and as for his generation,who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the livingand stricken for the disobedience of my people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They made his grave with the wicked,and with a rich man in his death;although he had done no violence,neither was any deceit in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him.He has caused him to suffer.When you make his soul an offering for sin,he shall see his offspring.He shall prolong his days,and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After the suffering of his soul,he will see light and be satisfied.By his knowledge shall my servant, the righteous one, make many righteous, and he will bear their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;because he poured out his soul to death,and was numbered with the transgressors;yet he bore the sins of many,and made intercession for their transgressions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
