Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With my soul have I desired you in the night. Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly; for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness. In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not see the Lord's majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord, your hand is lifted up, yet they do not see; but they will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed. Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Lord, you will ordain peace for us, for you have also worked all our works for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us, but by you only will we make mention of your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The dead shall not live. The deceased shall not rise. Therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and caused all memory of them to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You have increased the nation, O Lord. You have increased the nation! You are glorified! You have enlarged all the borders of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lord, in trouble they have visited you. They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs; so we have been before you, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We have been with child. We have been in pain. We gave birth, it seems, only to wind. We have not worked any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your dead shall live. My dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast forth the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for a little moment, until the indignation is past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For, behold, the Lord comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
