The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of the Lord. They cry aloud from the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore glorify the Lord in the east, even the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous! But I said, "I pine away! I pine away! Woe is me!" The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It shall happen in that day that the Lord will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the Lord of hosts will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders will be glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
