Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, "Thus says the Lord, 'Set your house in order, for you will die, and not live.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said, "Remember now, the Lord, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight." Hezekiah wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Go, and tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father, "I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>This shall be the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing that he has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.
