We have waited for you.Be our strength every morning,our salvation also in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled.When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.Men will leap on it as locusts leap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high.He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.The fear of the Lord is your treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, their valiant ones cry outside;the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The highways are desolate.The traveling man ceases.The covenant is broken.He has despised the cities.He doesn't regard man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The land mourns and languishes.Lebanon is confounded and withers away.Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Now I will arise," says the Lord;"Now I will lift myself up.Now I will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You will conceive chaff.You will bring forth stubble.Your breath is a fire that will devour you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The peoples will be like the burning of lime,like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hear, you who are far off, what I have done;and, you who are near, acknowledge my might."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sinners in Zion are afraid.Trembling has seized the godless ones.Who among us can live with the devouring fire?Who among us can live with everlasting burning?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who walks righteously,and speaks blamelessly;He who despises the gain of oppressions,who gestures with his hands, refusing to take a bribe,who stops his ears from hearing of blood,and shuts his eyes from looking at evil-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>he will dwell on high.His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks.His bread will be supplied.His waters will be sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your eyes will see the king in his beauty.They will see a distant land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your heart will meditate on the terror.Where is he who counted?Where is he who weighed?Where is he who counted the towers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will no longer see the fierce people,a people of a deep speech that you can't comprehend,with a strange language that you can't understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals.Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation,a tent that won't be removed.Its stakes will never be plucked up,nor will any of its cords be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But there the Lord will be with us in majesty,a place of broad rivers and streams,in which no galley with oars will go,neither will any gallant ship pass by there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Lord is our judge.The Lord is our lawgiver.The Lord is our king.He will save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your rigging is untied.They couldn't strengthen the foot of their mast.They couldn't spread the sail.Then the prey of a great spoil was divided.The lame took the prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The inhabitant won't say, "I am sick."The people who dwell therein will be forgiven their iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
