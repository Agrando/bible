Why have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?'"Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all your labors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: you do not fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Isn't this the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Isn't it to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then your light shall break forth as the morning, and your healing shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, 'Here I am.'"If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light shall rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the Lord will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make strong your bones; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy of the Lord honorable; and shall honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then you shall delight yourself in the Lord; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father:" for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
