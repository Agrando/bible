I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherim and the incense altars shall rise no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It will happen in that day, that the Lord will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship the Lord in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
