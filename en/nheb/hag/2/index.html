How do you see it now? Isn't it in your eyes as nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,' says the Lord. 'Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,' says the Lord, 'and work, for I am with you,' says the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. 'Do not be afraid.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this is what the Lord of hosts says: 'Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,' says the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,' says the Lord of hosts; 'and in this place will I give peace,' says the Lord of hosts."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Thus says the Lord of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>'If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?'"The priests answered, "No."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?"The priests answered, "It will be unclean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Haggai answered, "'So is this people, and so is this nation before me,' says the Lord; 'and so is every work of their hands.
