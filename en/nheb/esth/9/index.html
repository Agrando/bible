No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king's business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, but they did not lay their hand on the plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The king said to Esther the queen, "The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces!
