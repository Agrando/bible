To save a life, or to kill?" But they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed from Galilee, from Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, when they heard what great things he did, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he told his disciples that a small boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they would not press on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and shouted, "You are the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he appointed twelve, designating them apostles, and that he might send them out to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to cast out demons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he appointed the Twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jacob the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of Jacob, and he surnamed them Boanerges which means, Sons of Thunder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; Jacob, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he came into a house. The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When his family heard it, they went out to take charge of him: for they said, "He is out of his mind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul," and, "By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he summoned them, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly I tell you, all sins of the sons of men will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal judgment"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>-because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then his brothers and his mother came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he answered them, saying, "Who are my mother or my brothers?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
