That which you put on me, I will bear." The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time, Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the Lord's temple, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Rabshakeh said to them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, "What confidence is this in which you trust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You say (but they are but vain words), 'There is counsel and strength for war.' Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if you tell me, 'We trust in the Lord our God;' isn't that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me, 'Go up against this land, and destroy it.'"'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it. Do not speak with us in the Jews' language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? Hasn't he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus says the king, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, "The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do not listen to Hezekiah.' For thus says the king of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, "The Lord will deliver us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, "Do not answer him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
