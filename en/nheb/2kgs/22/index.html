Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, "Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me." Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It happened, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Go inquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She said to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Tell the man who sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Thus says the Lord, 'Behold, I will bring disaster on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, thus you shall tell him, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Concerning the words which you have heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before the Lord, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you,' says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>'Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the disaster which I will bring on this place.'"'"
