Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for the breaches of the house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the Lord: and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the Lord: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on the house of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But there were not made for the house of the Lord cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired therewith the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover they did not demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of the Lord: it was the priests'.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
