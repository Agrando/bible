I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Abram said, "Lord God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir, but he who will come forth out of your own body will be your heir."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He believed in the Lord; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said to him, "I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said, "Lord God, how will I know that I will inherit it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not divide the birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried in a good old age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
