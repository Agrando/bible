See that ye refuse not him that speaketh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for if they escaped not who refused him that delivered the oracle on earth, much more shall not we, who turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying , Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this word, Yet once more, sheweth the removal of the things which are shaken, as being made, that the things which are not shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us hold fast the grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
