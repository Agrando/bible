and by it, being dead he yet speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>By faith Enoch was translated so as not to see death, and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his houshold, by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham, being called to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, obeyed and went out, not knowing whither he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the joint heirs of the same promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he looked for the city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith Sarah also herself received power to conceive seed, even when she was past age, because she accounted him faithful who had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore there sprang even from one, and him as it were dead, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand which is on the sea-shore innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and embraced them, and confest that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they who speak thus, shew plainly, that they seek their own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And truly if they had been mindful of that from which they came out, they might have had opportunity to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they now desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared a city for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises, offered up his only begotten son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Accounting that God was able even to raise him from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By Faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, when dying, made mention of the children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months, by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he looked off unto the recompence of reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing him that is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first born should touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they passed thro' the Red Sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians trying to do, were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho, having been compassed seven days, fell down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with them that believed not, having received the spies with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what shall I say more? For the time would fail me, to tell of Gideon, and Barak, and Sampson, and Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who by faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness was made strong, became valiant in fight, put to flight armies of the aliens; Women received their dead raised to life again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheep-skins, in goat-skins, destitute, afflicted, tormented:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>(Of whom the world was not worthy) they wandered in deserts, and mountains, and dens, and caves of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And all these having obtained a good testimony thro' faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>did not receive the promise, God having provided some better thing for us, that they might not be perfected without us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
