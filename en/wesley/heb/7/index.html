being by interpretation, first king of righteousness, and then king of Salem also, which is king of peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Without father, without mother, without pedigree, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but being made like the son of God, remaineth a priest continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And verily they of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment (according to the law) to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brethren, tho' they come out of the loins of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he whose pedigree is not from them, took tythes of Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And here men that die receive tithes: but there, he of whom it is witnessed, that he liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And even Levi, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes (so to speak) thro' Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedek met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law) what farther need was there that another priest should rise, after the order of Melchisedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the priesthood being changed, there is also necessarily a change of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man attended on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is evident, that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it is still far more evident, because another priest is raised up, after the likeness of Melchidek, Who was made not after the law of a carnal commandment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but after the power of an endless life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is testified, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For verily there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by which we draw nigh to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in as much as not without an oath he was made priest: (For those priests were made without an oath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but this with an oath, by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Of so much better a covenant was Jesus made a surety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they truly were many priests, because they were hindered by death from continuing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But this, because he continueth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore he is able also, to save them to the uttermost who come to God thro' him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For such an high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law maketh men high priests that have infirmity; but the word of the oath which was since the law, maketh the son, who is consecrated for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
