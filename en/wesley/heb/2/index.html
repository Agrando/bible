Now in putting all things in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him: but now we do not yet see all things put under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour, for the suffering of death, who was made a little lower than the angels, that by the grace of God he might taste death for every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the captain of their salvation through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both he that sanctifieth, and all they that are sanctified, are of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, Saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, I will put my trust in him: And again, Behold I and the children whom God hath given me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since then the children partake of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And deliver them, as many as through fear of death, were all their life-time subject to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For verily he taketh not hold of angels, but he taketh hold of the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore it behoved him to be made in all things like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-priest, in things pertaining to God, to expiate the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in that he hath suffered, being tempted himself, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
