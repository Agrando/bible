If any one offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold we put bits into the horses mouths, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the ships, tho' they are so great, and driven by fierce winds, yet are turned about by a very small helm, whithersoever the pilot listeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the tongue also is a little member, yet boasteth great things. Behold how much matter a little fire kindleth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: it is the tongue among the members which defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind both of wild beasts and of birds, both of reptiles and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the tongue can no man tame: it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therewith bless we God the Father, and therewith curse we man, made after the likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Doth a fountain send out of the same place sweet water and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries, or a vine figs? So can no fountain yield salt water and fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is a wise and knowing man among you? Let him shew by a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye have bitter zeal and strife in your hearts, do not glory and lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, animal, devilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where bitter zeal and strife is, there is unquietness and every evil work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>without partiality and without dissimulation, And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
