Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>descending from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore laying aside all the filthiness and superfluity of wickedness, receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if any one be an hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he beheld himself, and went away, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But whoso looketh diligently into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and continueth therein, this man being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the word, this man shall be happy in his doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any one be ever so religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspoted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
