For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>in fine apparel, and there come in also a poor man in dirty raiment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And ye look upon him that weareth the fine apparel, and say to him, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my footstool, Ye distinguish not in yourselves, but are become evil-reasoning judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But ye have disgraced the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to the judgment-seats? Do not they blaspheme that worthy name, by which ye are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If ye fulfil the royal law (according to the Scripture) Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. If then thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak ye and so act, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment without mercy shall be to him that shewed no mercy: mercy glorieth over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What doth it profit, my brethren, tho' a man say he hath faith, and have not works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Can that faith save him? If a brother or a sister be naked,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and want daily food, And one of you say to them, Depart in peace; be ye warmed and filled, but give them not the things needful for the body, what doth it profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So likewise faith, if it hath not works, is dead in itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But one will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou believest there is one God: thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But art thou willing to know, O empty man, that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou seest that faith wrought together with his works, and by works was faith made perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye see then, that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner Rahab the harlot also was justified by works, having received the messengers and sent them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
