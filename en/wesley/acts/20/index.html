and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These going before, staid for us at Troas, And we set sail from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and came to them at Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And on the first day of the week, when we were met together to break bread, Paul being to depart on the morrow, preached to them, and continued his discourse till midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a certain young man, named Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a deep sleep: and as Paul still continued his discourse, being overpowered with sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Paul went down and fell on him; and taking him in his arms, said, Be not troubled; for his life is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And going up again, and having broken bread, he conversed long with them, even till break of day, and so departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we going before into the ship, sailed to Assos, where we were to take up Paul; for so he had appointed, being himself to go on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met us at Assos, we took him up and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And sailing thence, we came the following day over-against Chios, and the next day we touched at Samos, and having tarried at Trogyllium, the day after came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he hasted, if it were possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And sending to Ephesus from Miletus, he called thither the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they were come to him, he said to them, Ye know in what manner I have conversed among you, all the time from the first day I came into Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me through the ambushes of the Jews:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And that I have with-held nothing which was profitable, but have preached to you, and taught you, publickly and from house to house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now behold, being bound by the Spirit, I go to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Save that the Holy Ghost testifieth to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life precious to myself, so I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now I know that ye all among whom I have conversed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take heed therefore to yourselves and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yea, from among yourselves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, I ceased not to warn every one, night and day, with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yea, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministred to my necessities, and to them that were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring ye ought to help the infirm, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, which he himself said, It is happier to give than to receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having said these things, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all wept sore, and falling on Paul's neck kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Sorrowing most for that word which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
