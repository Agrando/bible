Others, he seemeth to be a proclaimer of strange gods; because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, which is spoken by thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears; we would therefore know, what these things mean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(For all the Athenians, and the strangers sojourning there, spent their time in nothing else, but telling or hearing some new thing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that ye are greatly addicted to the worship of invisible powers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed along and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar, on which was inscribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD: him therefore whom ye worship without knowing him, I proclaim unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God who made the world and all things therein, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed any thing, he himself giving to all life and breath, and all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he hath made of one the whole nation of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That they might seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in him we live and move, and have our being; as certain likewise of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead is like gold or silver, or stone, graven by art and contrivance of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The times of ignorance indeed God overlooked; but he now commandeth all men every where to repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by the man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked: but others said, We will hear thee again concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul departed from among them. Howbeit, some clave to him and believed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>among whom was even Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
