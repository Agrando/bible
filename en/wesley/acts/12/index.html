And his chains fell off from his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals; and he did so. And he saith to him, Throw thy garment about thee, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And going out, he followed him. And he knew not, that it was real which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city, which opened to them of its own accord: and going out, they went on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Peter coming to himself, said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And having considered, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And knowing Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but running in, told them, that Peter stood before the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed, it was so. Then they said, It is his angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter continued knocking. And opening the door, they saw him and were astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he beckoning to them with his hand, to be silent, declared to them, How the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Shew these things to James and to the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And going out, he went to another place. Now when it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, What was become of Peter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Herod having sought for him, and not found him, examined the guard, and commanded them to be put to death. And going down from Judea to Cesarea, he abode there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he was highly incensed against them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and having gained Blastus, the king's chamberlain, sued for peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And on a set day, Herod arrayed in royal apparel, and sitting on his throne, made an oration to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people shouted, It is the voice of God, and not of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory; and being eaten by worms, he expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the word of God grew and multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas and Saul, having fulfilled their service, returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, surnamed Mark.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
