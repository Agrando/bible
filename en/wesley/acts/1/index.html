This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as ye have seen him going into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they were come in, they went up into the upper-room, where both Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James tarried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These all continued unanimously in prayer and supplication with the women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in these days, Peter standing up in the midst of the disciples, (the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty) said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men, brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spake before by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling down on his face, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it was known to all that dwell at Jerusalem, so that that field is called, in their own tongue, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His office let another take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wherefore of these men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus was going in and out over us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Beginning from the baptism of John, till the day that he was taken up from us, one must be ordained, to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, shew which of these two thou hast chosen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, to go to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
