And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet have I been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who having examined me, were willing to have released me, because there was no cause of death in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when the Jews opposed it, I was constrained to appeal to Cesar; not that I had any thing to accuse my nation of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For this cause therefore have I intreated, to see and speak with you; for it is on account of the hope of Israel, that I am bound with this chain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning thee, nor hath any of the brethren coming hither, related or spoke any evil of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for concerning this sect, we know, that it is every where spoken against.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he expounded the kingdom of God, testifying and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And not agreeing with each other, they brake up the assembly, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Saying, Go to this people and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debating with each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Paul continued two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things that relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, no man forbidding him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
