And a considerable multitude was added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then went he to Tarsus to seek Saul; and having found him, he brought him to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught a considerable multitude: and the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. And one of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>named Agabus stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine through all the world; which also came to pass under Claudius Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the disciples determined to send relief, every one according to his ability, to the brethren who dwelt in Judea: Which also they did,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>sending it to the elders, by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
