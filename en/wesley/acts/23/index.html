For sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said Paul, I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not revile the ruler of thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Paul perceiving, that the one part were Saducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I called in question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he had said this, there arose a contention between the Pharisees and the Saducees: and the multitude was divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Saducees say, there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there was a great clamour: and the scribes of the Pharisees side arising, contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as a great disturbance arose, the tribune fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the night following, the Lord standing by him, said, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must testify at Rome also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when it was day, some of the Jews entering into a conspiracy, bound themselves under a curse, saying, That they would neither eat nor drink, till they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they were more than forty, who had made this confederacy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves by a solemn curse, not to taste anything, till we have killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore ye with the council signify to the tribune, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as though ye would more accurately examine the things concerning him: and we, before he came near, are ready to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came, and entering into the castle, told Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Paul calling to him one of the centurions, said, Conduct this young man to the tribune; for he hath something to tell him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he took and led him to the tribune, and said, Paul the prisoner, calling me to him, desired me, to bring this young man to thee, who hath something to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the tribune taking him by the hand, and going aside privately asked, What is it, that thou hast to tell me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee, to bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would enquire something concerning him more accurately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But do not yield to them; for there are more than forty of them lie in wait, who have bound themselves with a curse, neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, expecting a promise from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the tribune dismissed the young man, having charged him, Tell no man, that thou hast discovered these things to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having called to him two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And provide beasts, to set Paul upon, and conduct him safe to Felix the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he wrote a letter after this manner, Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Governor Felix, greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As this man was seized by the Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and about to be killed by them, I came with the soldiery and rescued him, having learned, that he was a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before their council: Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but to be charged with nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when it was shewn me, that an ambush was about to be laid for the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to thee, commanding his accusers also, to say before thee what they have against him. Farewel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The soldiers therefore, taking Paul, as it was commanded them, brought him by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>On the morrow they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who entering into Cesarea, and delivering the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having read it, he asked, of what province he was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And being informed, that he was of Cilicia, I will give thee, said he, a thorough hearing, when thy accusers also are come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
