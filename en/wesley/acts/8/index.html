And they were all scattered abroad through the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul made havock of the church, entring into every house, and haling men and women, committed them to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went every where, preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Philip coming down to a city of Samaria, preached Christ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the people with one accord gave heed to the things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many that had them, and many sick of the palsy and lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a certain man, named Simon, had been before in the city, using magic, and astonishing the Samaritans, saying, that he was some great one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They gave heed to him, because he had a long time astonished them with witchcraft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip, preaching the things of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he continued with Philip, and was astonished, beholding the signs and mighty miracles which were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the apostles who were at Jerusalem, hearing that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who being come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Simon seeing that thro' laying on of the hands of the apostles the Holy Ghost was given,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>offered them money, Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought to purchase the gift of God with money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see, thou art in the gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Simon answering said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things, which ye have spoken, may come upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They then, having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned toward Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And an angel of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south by the way leading down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he arose and went. And lo an Ethiopian, an eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and had come to Jerusalem to worship, Was returning, and sitting in his chariot, read the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip running to him, heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How can I, unless some one guide me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he desired Philip to come up, and sit with him. The portion of scripture which he was reading, was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so he opened not his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? For his life is taken from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the eunuch answering Philip, said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opening his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached Jesus to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went on the way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said, Behold water: what hindereth me to be baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayst. And he answering said, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down to the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Cesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
