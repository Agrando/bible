And behold a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who was well reported of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Him Paul would have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew his father, that he was a Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as they went through the cities, they gave them the decrees, which were determined by the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem to keep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, being forbid by the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Coming to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit suffered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. And a vision appeared to Paul by night:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>a man of Macedonia stood and intreated him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, assuredly inferring, that the Lord called us to preach the gospel to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sailing therefore from Troas, we ran with a strait course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from thence to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And we abode in that city certain days. And on the sabbath we went out of the city, by the river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and sitting down, we spake to the women who were come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, a worshiper of God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to assent to the things which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when she was baptized and her family, she intreated us saying, Since ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there. And she constrained us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as we were going to prayer, a certain damsel, possest by a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by prophesying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She following after Paul and us, cried out, saying, These men are servants of the most high God, who declare to us the way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this she did for many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out of her. And he came out the same hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when her owners saw, that the hope of their gain was gone, laying hold of Paul and Silas, they dragged them into the market-place to the magistrates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having brought them to the pretors, they said, These men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city, And teach customs, which it is not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive, neither to observe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the multitude rose up together against them; and the pretors tearing off their garments, commanded to beat them with rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But at midnight Paul and Silas having prayed, sung an hymn to God: and the prisoners heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the jailor awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, supposing the prisoners were fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm; for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he called for lights, and sprang in, and trembling, fell down before Paul and Silas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And having brought them out he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved and thy houshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spake the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And taking them that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his houshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having brought them up into his house, he set a table before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with his whole house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it was day, the pretors sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the jailor told these things to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publickly, uncondemned, and have cast us into prison, who are Romans: and do they now thrust us out privately? Nay verily: but let them come themselves and conduct us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the serjeants reported these words to the pretors; and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they came and comforted them; and conducting them out, requested that they would depart from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And coming out of the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
