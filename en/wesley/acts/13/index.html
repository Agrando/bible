He calling to him Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas, the magician (so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Saul (who is also called Paul ) filled with the Holy Ghost,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and fixing his eyes upon him, said, O full of all guile and all mischief, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee; and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately a mist and darkness fell upon him, and going about, he sought some to lead him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the proconsul, seeing what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Paul and those with him loosing from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John withdrawing from them, returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And departing from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia; and going into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the chief of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation to the people, speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Paul standing, and waving his hand, said, Ye men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people chose our fathers, and raised the people, while sojourning in the land of Egypt, and brought them out of it with an uplifted arm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he suffered their manners in the wilderness, about the space of forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot, about four hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after that, he gave them judges, until Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterward they desired a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having removed him, he raised up to them David for their king, to whom also bearing witness he said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, who will do all my will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of this man's seed hath God, according to his promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>John having first preached before his coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But behold one cometh after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, neither knowing him, nor the sayings of the prophets, which are read very sabbath-day, have fulfilled them, in condemning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate, that he might be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, taking him down from the tree, they laid him in a sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he was seen many days by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we declare to you glad tidings, that the promise which was made to the fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God hath fulfilled this to us their children, in raising up Jesus: as it is written also in the second Psalm, Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And because he raised him up from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he spake thus, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Wherefore he saith also in another Psalm, Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy one to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now David, having served the will of God in his generation, fell asleep, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he whom God raised, did not see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Be it known unto you therefore, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken in the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold ye despisers, and wonder and perish. For I work a work in your days, a work which ye will in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought them, that these words might be spoken to them on the sabbath between.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them, persuaded them, to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together, to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with zeal, and spake against the things spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly, said, It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold! we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set Thee for a light of the Gentiles, that Thou mightest be for salvation to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the Gentiles hearing it were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the word of the Lord was spread through all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews stirred up the devout, honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and went to Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
