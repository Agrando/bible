But this I confess unto thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that after the way, which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Having hope in God, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust, which they themselves also expect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And for this cause do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purifying in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who ought to have been present before thee, and to accuse me, if they had any thing against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Or let these themselves say, what crime they found in me, when I stood before the council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Unless it be concerning this one word, that I cried, standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead, I am called in question by you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Felix heard these things, he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias the tribune cometh down, I will take full cognisance of your affair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and let him have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting or coming to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after some days, Felix coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he reasoned concerning justice, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix being terrified, answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he hoped also that money would have been given him by Paul to release him; therefore he sent for him the oftner, and discoursed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But after two years, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus: and Felix desiring to gratify the Jews, left Paul bound.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
