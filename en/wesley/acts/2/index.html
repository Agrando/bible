and it sat upon each of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together and were confounded, because every man heard them speaking in his own language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they were amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And how hear we every one, in our own native language?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers in Mesopotamia, and Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Africk about Cyrene, and Roman sojourners, (Jews and Proselytes) Cretans and Arabians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonderful works of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What can this mean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others mocking, said, They are full of sweet wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>These are not drunken as ye suppose for it is but the third hour of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in those days I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and upon my handmaids, and they shall prophecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will shew prodigies in heaven above, and signs on earth beneath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>blood and fire, and vapour of smoke, The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the day of the Lord, the great and illustrious day, come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man pointed out to you of God, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as yourselves also know:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands, have crucified and slain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, as it was not possible that he should be held under it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David speaketh concerning him, I have seen the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right-hand, that I may not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue exulteth; yea, and my flesh shall rest in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy by thy countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Men and brethren, I may say to you freely of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is among us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, That of the fruit of his loins one should sit on his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He foreseeing this, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in Hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus God hath raised up, whereof all we are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Being therefore exalted by the right-hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David is not ascended into the heavens; but he saith himself, The Lord said to my Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Sit thou on my right-hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, That God hath made this Jesus whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And hearing this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter said, Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they, gladly receiving his word, were baptized; and there were added to them that day about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they continued stedfast in the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, and the prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all that believed were together, and had all things common,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, as any one had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking the bread at home, they ate their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added daily to the church those who were saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
