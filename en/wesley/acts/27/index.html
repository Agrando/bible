And Julius treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends, to refresh himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And setting sail from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And having sailed through the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria there, bound for Italy, put us on board of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were scarce come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And passing it with difficulty, we came to the Fair Havens, near which was the city Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as much time was spent, and sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was already past,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Paul exhorted them, Saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage is like to be with injury and much damage, not only to the lading and the ship, but also to our lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the centurion regarded the master and the owner of the vessel, more than the things, which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as the haven was not convenient to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence also, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter there, which is an haven of Crete looking to the south-west and north-west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as the south wind blew gently, supposing they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed on close by Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Euroclydon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the ship being caught, and not able to bear up against the wind, we let her drive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And running under a certain Island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get masters of the boat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Which having taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they struck sail, and so were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as we were in an exceeding great storm, the next day they lightened the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was then taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But after long abstinence, Paul standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and so have avoided this injury and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet now I exhort you to be of good courage; for there shall be no loss of any life among you, but of the ship only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there stood by me this night an angel of the God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not, Paul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>thou must be presented before Cesar: and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore, Sirs, take courage: for I trust in God, that it shall be even as it hath been spoken to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But we must be cast on a certain island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, the sailors suspected, that they drew nigh some land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And sounding, they found twenty fathoms; and having gone a little farther, sounding again, they found fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And fearing lest they should fall upon some rocky ground, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when the sailors were attempting to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going to carry out anchors from the ship-head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth that ye have tarried and continue fasting, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore I exhort you to take food; for this is for your preservation; for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having spoken thus, he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all; and having broken it, he began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then were they all incouraged, and they also took meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And we were in the ship in all, two hundred and seventy-six souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it was day, they did not know the land; but they observed a certain creek having a shore, into which they were minded, if possible, to thrust the ship:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having taken up the anchors, they committed it to the sea, at the same time loosing the rudder-bands, and hoisting up the stay-sail to the wind, they made for the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a ground; and the fore-part sticking fast, remained immovable, but the hinder-part was broken by the force of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the counsel of the soldiers was, to kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim away and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, being desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and commanded those that could swim, throwing themselves into the sea, first to get away to land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship; and so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
