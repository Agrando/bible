And the number of the men was about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And on the morrow were gathered together at Jerusalem their rulers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and elders, and scribes, And Annas the high-priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high-priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And having set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we are examined this day, of the benefit done to the impotent man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>by what means he is healed, Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, by him doth this man stand before you whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the stone which was set at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and understanding that they were illiterate and uneducated men, they marvelled, and took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And beholding the man who had been healed, standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But having ordered them to go out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a signal miracle hath been wrought by them, is manifest to all that dwell at Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet that it spread no farther among the people, let us severely threaten them, that they speak no more to any man in this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And having called them, they charged them, Not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answering, said to them, Whether it be righteous in the sight of God, to obey you rather than God, judge ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we cannot but speak the things, which we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having threatened them again, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for they all glorified God for that which was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought, was above forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being let go, they went to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art the God who madest heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who saidst by the mouth of thy servant David, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For of a truth, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>To do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel before determined to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and give thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done thro' the name of thy holy child Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And while they were praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one soul: and not so much as one said that ought of the things which he had, was his own, but they had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the apostles gave forth their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power, and great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For neither was there any one among them that lacked: for whosoever were possessors of houses or lands sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And laid them down at the feet of the apostles, and distribution was made to every one, according as any had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joses, by the apostles surnamed Barnabas, which is, being interpreted, a son of consolation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>a Levite, a Cyprian by birth, Having an estate, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
