And Gallio cared for none of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul still continued many days; and then taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shaved his head at Cenchrea; for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he came to Ephesus, and left him there; but he himself going into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But though they intreated him to tarry longer with them, he consented not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But took his leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem, but I will return to you again, if God will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he set sail from Ephesus. And landing at Cesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having spent some time there, he departed, and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a certain Jew, Apollos by name, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he spake boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla hearing him, took him to their house, and explained to him the way of God more perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he was desirous to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who being come thither, greatly helped through grace them that had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he earnesty debated with the Jews in publick, shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
