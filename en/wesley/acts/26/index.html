I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am this day to make my defence before thee, concerning all those things whereof I am accused by the Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Who art accurately acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews, wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The manner of my life from my youth which was from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>all the Jews know, Who knew me from the first, (if they would testify) that I lived a Pharisee, after the strictest sect of our religion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now I stand in judgment, for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To which our twelve tribes, worshiping continually night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>What? Is it judged by you an incredible thing, that God should raise the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I indeed thought myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Which also I did in Jerusalem: and having received authority from the chief priests, I shut up many of the saints in prisons, and when they were killed, I gave my vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And frequently punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whereupon as I was going to Damascus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>with authority and commission from the chief priests, At mid-day, O king, I saw in the way, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round me and them that journeyed with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I said, Who art thou, Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to ordain thee a minister and a witness, both of the things which thou hast seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and of those in which I will appear to thee, Delivering thee from the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee, To open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive through faith which is in me, forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From that time, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But first to them at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea, and then to the Gentiles I declare, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For these things the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to kill me with their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But having obtained help from God, I continue till this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moses have declared should be,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That the Christ having suffered, and being the first who rose from the dead, should shew light to the people and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as he was thus making his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter the words of truth and sobriety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king knoweth of these things; to whom also I speak with freedom; for I am persuaded none of these things are hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, Believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but likewise all that hear me, were this day both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as he said this, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they were going away, they spake one to another, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cesar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
