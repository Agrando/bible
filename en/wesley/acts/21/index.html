I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after these days, we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And some of the disciples also from Cesarea went with us, and brought us to one Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we were come up to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the next day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having saluted them, he gave them a particular account of those things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of believing Jews there are, and they are all zealous for the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to apostatize from Moses, telling them, not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together; for they will hear that thou art come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore do this that we say to thee: there are with us four men, who have a vow on them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Take them and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know, that there is nothing of those things which they have heard of thee; but that thou thyself walkest orderly, keeping the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written and determined, that they should observe no such thing; save only that they keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification, till the offering should be offered for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the seven days were about to be accomplished, the Jews that were from Asia seeing him in the temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, Crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: yea, and hath even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the whole city was moved, and the people ran together; and laying hold on Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they went about to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they ceased from beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the tribune came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired, Who he was, and what he had done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some among the multitude cried out one thing, some another; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But when he came upon the stairs, he was borne of the soldiers, through the violence of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the multitude of people followed after, crying, Away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out four thousand murtherers into the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am a man who am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, waved his hand to the people: and a great silence being made, he spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
