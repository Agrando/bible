And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, And said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Come out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into a land, which I will shew thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And coming out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran. And from thence, after his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not to set his foot on; yet he promised to give it him for a possession, even to his seed after him, when he had no child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And God spake thus: That his seed should sojourn in a strange land, (and they will inslave them and treat them evil) four hundred years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage, will I judge, saith God. And after that, they shall come forth, and serve me in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day, and Isaac Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the patriachs moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt; but God was with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharoah king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt, and all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers found no sustenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Jacob hearing there was corn in Egypt, sent our fathers first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the second time, Joseph was made known to his brethren, and Joseph's kindred was discovered to Pharoah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Joseph sending, called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he and our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And were carried over to Shechem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money, of Hamor, the father of Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when the time of the promise which God had sworn to Abraham drew near, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, Till another king arose, who had not known Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He dealing subtilely with our kindred,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>evil intreated our fathers, by causing their male infants to be exposed, that they might not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding beautiful, who was nursed three months in his father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he was exposed, Pharoah's daughter took him up, and brought him up for her own son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And seeing one wronged, he defended and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he supposed his brethren would have understood, that God would deliver them by his hand; but they understood it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the next day, he shewed himself to them, as they were quarrelling, and would have persuaded them to peace, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren: why do ye wrong one another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he that wronged his neighbour thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses fled at that saying, and was a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And forty years being expired, the angel of the Lord appeared to him, in the wilderness, in a flame of fire in a bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses seeing it, wondered at the sight. But as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came to him, I am the God of thy fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet; for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I have surely seen the evil treatment of my people which is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come; I will send thee into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This Moses, whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a prince and a judge, the same did God send, to be a ruler and a deliverer, by the hand of the Angel, who appeared to him in the bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He brought them out, doing wonders and signs, in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, The Lord your God will raise you up, out of your brethren, a prophet like me: him shall ye hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the Angel who spake to him in mount Sinai, and with our fathers; who received the living oracles to give to us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back into Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And God turned and gave them up, to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Have ye offered victims and sacrifices to me, for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Yea, ye took up the shrine of Molock, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, as he had appointed who spake to Moses, to make it according to the model which he had seen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Which also our fathers having received, brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out from the face of our fathers, till the days of David:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who found favour with God, and petitioned to find an habitation for the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But Solomon built him an house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Yet the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet, Heaven is my throne, and earth my footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>What house will ye build me, saith the Lord: or What is the place of my rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Hath not my hand made all these things? Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye always resist the Holy Ghost:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>as your fathers, so do ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them that shewed before of the coming of the Just One, of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: Who have received the law by the administration of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and have not kept it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And hearing these things, they were cut to the heart, and gnashed their teeth upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he being full of the Holy Ghost, looking up stedfastly to heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right-hand of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right-hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then they cried with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And casting him out of the city, stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they stoned Stephen, invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And having said this, he fell asleep: And Saul was consenting to his death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
