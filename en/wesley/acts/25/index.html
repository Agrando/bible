Then Festus, having conferred with the council answered, Hast thou appealed to Cesar? To Cesar shalt thou go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after certain days, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea, to salute Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared the case of Paul to the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>About whom when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, desiring judgment against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans, to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have liberty to make his defence, touching the crime laid to his charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When therefore they were come hither, I without any delay sat at the judgment seat the next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But had certain questions against him, relating to their own religious worship, and about one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked, If he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Paul appealing to be kept for the hearing of Augustus, I command him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow thou shalt hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pomp, and were entered into the place of audience, with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all ye who are present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when I found, that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and he had himself appealed to the Emperor, I determined to send him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Of whom I have nothing certain to send to my lord: wherefore I have brought him before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination taken, I may have somewhat to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not to signify also the crimes alledged against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
