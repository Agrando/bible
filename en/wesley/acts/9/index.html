And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee, to kick against the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men that journeyed with him stood astonished, hearing a noise, but seeing no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul arose from the earth; and his eyes being opened, he saw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, Behold I am here, Lord. And the Lord said to him, Arise, go into the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas, for one named Saul of Tarsus; for behold, he is praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he hath seen in a vision a man, named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he may recover his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And here also he hath authority from the chief priests, to bind all that call on thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord said unto him, Go: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before nations and kings, and the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Ananias went and entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord hath sent me, Jesus who appeared to thee in the way thou camest, that thou mayst recover thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately as it were scales fell from his eyes, and he recovered his sight, and arose and was baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having received food, he was strengthened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he was certain days with the disciples in Damascus: And straightway he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all that heard were amazed, and said, Is not this he who destroyed those that call on this name at Jerusalem? And came hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted together to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But their lying in wait was known by Saul: and they guarded the gates day and night to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the disciples, taking him by night, let him down by the wall in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And coming to Jerusalem, he endeavoured to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas taking him, brought him to the apostles, and declared to them, How he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus, in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was with them, coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, he disputed with the Hellenists: but they attempted to kill him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Which the brethren knowing, brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the church through all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria had peace: and being built up, and walking in the fear of God, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, was multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as Peter passed through all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, being ill of a palsy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee. Arise and make thy bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he arose immediately. And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now there was at Joppa, a certain disciple, named Tabitha, which is by interpretation Dorcas; this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And in those days she was sick and died; whom having washed, they laid in an upper chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples hearing Peter was there, sent to him two men, desiring that he would not delay to come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Peter arose and went with them; whom being come, they brought into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Peter, having put them all out, kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And giving her his hand, and having called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it was known through all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he tarried many days in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
