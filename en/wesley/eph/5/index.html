for because of these things the wrath of God cometh upon the sons of disobedience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For ye were once darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>walk as children of light; (The fruit of the light is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Searching what is acceptable to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is a shame even to speak the things which are done by them in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See then that ye walk circumspectly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>not as fools, but as wise men, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what is the will of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And be not drunken with wine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>wherein is excess; but be ye filled with the Spirit, Speaking to each other in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your hearts unto the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Giving thanks always for all things to God even the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the husband is head of the wife, as Christ also is head of the church:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(and he is the Saviour of the body) Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That he might sanctify it (having cleansed it by the washing of water) through the word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, that it may be holy and unblamable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Men ought so to love their wives as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also the Lord the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is a great mystery; I mean, concerning Christ and the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But let every one of you in particular so love his wife as himself: and let the wife reverence her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
