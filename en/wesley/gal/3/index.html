Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have ye suffered so many things in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If it be yet in vain? Doth he that ministreth the Spirit to you, and worketh miracles among you, do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Know then, that they who are of faith, these are the sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared before the glad tidings to Abraham, In thee shall all the nations be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all the things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But that none is justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident; for the just shall live by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the law is not of faith; but the man that doeth them, shall live by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>) That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I speak after the manner of men: though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, none disannulleth or addeth thereto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this I say, the covenant which was before confirmed of God through Christ, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance be by the law, it is no more by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore then was the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made: and it was ordained by angels, in the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is then the law against the promises of God? God forbid. But if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness would have been by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up together unto the faith which was to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore the law was our school-master unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But faith being come, we are no longer under a school-master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For ye are all sons of God by faith in Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if ye are Christ's, then are ye the seed of Abraham, and heirs according to the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
