I am afraid for you, lest I have laboured upon you in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Brethren, I beseech you, be ye as I am; for I also am as ye were: ye have not injured me at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ye know how though infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye did not slight or disdain my temptation which was in the flesh, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes, and have given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Am I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only while I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Christ be formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, ye that would be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written, Abraham had two sons, one by the bond-woman, another by the free-woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he of the bond-woman was born after the flesh, but he of the free-woman by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things are an allegory; for these are the two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Agar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem that now is, and is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>(For it is written, Rejoice thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for the desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then, he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so it is now also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and her son; for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
