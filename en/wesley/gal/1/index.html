Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Christ who called you by his grace to another gospel, Which is not another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but there are some that trouble you, and would subvert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if we or an angel from heaven preach to you another gospel than we have preached to you, let him be accursed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, so I say now again, if any preach to you another gospel than that ye received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For do I now satisfy men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither did I receive it from man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For ye have heard of my behaviour in time past in the Jewish religion, that above measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I profited in the Jewish religion above many of my years among my countrymen, being more abundantly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither did I go up to Jerusalem, to them that were apostles before me, but I immediately went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But other of the apostles I saw none, save James, the brother of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the things which I write to you, behold before God, I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only they had heard, He that persecuted in time past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
