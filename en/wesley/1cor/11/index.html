For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus the night in which he was betrayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>took bread, And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner also he took the cup after he had supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye shew forth the Lord's death, till he come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So that whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not distinguishing the Lord's body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause many are sick and weak among you, and many sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye come not together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
