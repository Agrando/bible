And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Know ye not, that we shall judge angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>How much more things pertaining to this life? If then ye have any controversies of things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no esteem in the church?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I speak to your shame. What, is there not so much as one wise man among you, that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goeth to law with brother, and this before the infidels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Indeed even this is altogether a fault among you, that ye have contests with each other. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, even your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know ye not, that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor sodomites, Nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor revilers, nor the rapacious shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful for me; but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats are for the belly, and the belly for meats; yet God will destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know ye not, that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>God forbid. Know ye not, that he who is joined to an harlot is one body? For they two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Know ye not, that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have from God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And ye are not your own: For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God with your body and your spirit, which are God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
