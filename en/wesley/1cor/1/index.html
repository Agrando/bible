Was Paul crucified for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Or were ye baptized into the name of Paul? I thank God, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lest any should say, that I had baptized in my own name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I baptized also the family of Stephanas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I know not that I baptized any other. For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel; but not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the doctrine of the cross is indeed to them that perish foolishness; but to us who are saved, it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and abolish the understanding of the prudent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For whereas the Jews demand signs, and the Greeks seek wisdom, We preach Christ crucified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold your calling brethren: that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world, to shame the things that are mighty:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the base things of the world, and things that are despised, hath God chosen; yea, things that are not, to bring to nought the things that are; That no flesh may glory before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is made by God unto us wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
