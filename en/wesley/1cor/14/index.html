For ye will speak to the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let there be ever so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them without signification:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yet if I know not the meaning of the language, I shall be a barbarian to him that speaketh, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So ye also, seeing ye desire spiritual gifts, seek to abound in them, to the edifying of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then is my duty? I will pray with the Spirit; but I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the Spirit; but I will sing with the understanding also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise if thou givest thanks with the Spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of a private person, say Amen to thy thanksgiving, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thou verily givest thanks well; yet the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God, that I speak with tongues more than you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet in the congregation I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, be not children in understanding: in wickedness be ye as infants, but in understanding be ye grown men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is written in the law, In foreign tongues and with foreign lips will I speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; whereas prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet if the whole church be met together, and all speak with unknown tongues, and there come in ignorant persons or unbelievers, will they not say, that ye are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whereas if all prophesy, and there come in an unbeliever, or an ignorant person, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The secrets of his heart are made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and declare that God is among you of a truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What a thing is it, brethren, that when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Let all things be done to edification. If any one speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two or three at most, and that by course, and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let two or three of the prophets speak, and let the rest judge. But if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the Spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the law also saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they desire to learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is indecent for a woman to speak in the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Did the word of God come out from you? or did it come to you alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any one think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you, are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any one is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, brethren, covet to prophesy; yet forbid not to speak with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
