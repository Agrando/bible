So the things of God also knoweth no one, but the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which are freely given to us of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, explaining spiritual things by spiritual words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit; for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the spiritual man discerneth all things, while he himself is discerned by no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
