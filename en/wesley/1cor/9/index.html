Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Are not ye my work in the Lord? If I am not an apostle to others, yet I am to you; for ye are the seal of my apostleship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My answer to them who examine me is this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have we not power to eat and to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Have we not power to lead about with us a sister, a wife, as well as the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Peter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who ever warreth at his own charge? Who planteth a vineyard, and doth not eat of its fruit? Or who feedeth a flock, and doth not eat of the milk of the flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do I speak these things as a man? Doth not the law also speak the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is written, in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn? Doth God take care for oxen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or speaketh he chiefly for our sakes? surely for our sakes it was written: for he who ploweth, ought to plow in hope; and he that thresheth in hope, ought to be a partaker of his hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter, if we shall reap your carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others partake of this power over you, do not we rather? Yet we have not used this power: but we suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Know ye not, that they who are employed about holy things, are fed out of the temple? And they who wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So also hath the Lord ordained, that they who preach the gospel, should live of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have used none of these things; nor have I written thus, that it might be done so unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make this my glorying void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for a necessity lieth upon me, and wo is me, if I preach not the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If indeed I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, yet a dispensation is intrusted to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then is my reward? that when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For though I am free from all men, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To them that are without the law, as without the law, (being not without the law to God, but under the law to Christ) that I might gain them that are without the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that by all means I might save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I may be partaker thereof with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know ye not, that they who run in the race, all run, but one receiveth the prize? so run that ye may obtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And every one that contendeth, is temperate in all things: and they indeed, to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; I so fight, not as one that beateth the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest by any means, after having preached to others, I myself should become a reprobate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
