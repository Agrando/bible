I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we, being many, are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of the one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Consider Israel after the flesh. Are not they who eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What say I then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is any thing? or that an idol is any thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But that what the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. Now I would not that ye should be partakers with devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and the table of devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things are lawful for me; but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me; but all things edify not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one seek his own, but every one another's welfare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whatever is sold in the shambles eat, asking no questions for conscience sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if any of the unbelievers invite you, and ye are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for conscience sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if any one say to you, This hath been sacrificed to an idol, eat not, for his sake that shewed thee, and for conscience sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Conscience I say, not thy own, but that of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another's conscience?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I blamed for that for which I give thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Give no offence either to the Jews, or to the Gentiles, or to the church of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but that of many that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
