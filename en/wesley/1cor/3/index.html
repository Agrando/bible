Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he that planteth and he that watereth are one; and every one shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are fellow-labourers of God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master-builder I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon; but let every one take heed how he buildeth thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For other foundation can no man lay, than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ: And if any one build on this foundation, gold, silver, costly stones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>wood, hay, stubble, Every one's work shall be made manifest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for the day shall declare it: for it is revealed by fire; yea the fire shall try every one's work, of what sort it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any one's work which he hath built thereon shall remain, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any one's work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but himself shall be saved, yet so as through the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know ye not, that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man destroy the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let none deceive himself: if any one among you thinketh himself to be wise, let him become a fool in this world, that he may become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; as it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let none glory in men; for all things are yours:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas; or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all are yours, And ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
