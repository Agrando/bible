And then shall every one have praise from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These things, brethren, I have by a figure transferred to myself and Apollos, for your sakes; that ye may learn in us, not to think of men above what is here written, that ye may not be puffed up for one above another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou boast, as if thou hadst not received it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now ye are full: now ye are rich: ye have reigned as kings without us. And I would ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think God hath set forth us the apostles last, as appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are fools for Christ's sake; but ye are wise in Christ: we are weak; but ye are strong: ye are honourable; but we are despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even to this present hour, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain abode, And labour, working with our own hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and off-scouring of all things to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for I have begotten you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I beseech you therefore, be ye followers of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this cause I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now some are puffed up, as if I would not come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord permit, and will know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What will ye? That I come to you with a rod? or in love, and the spirit of meekness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
