If the foot should say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if the ear should say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now hath God set the members, every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if all were one member, where were the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whereas now there are indeed many members, yet but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea, the members of the body, which appear to be weaker, are much more necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those which we think to be the less honourable parts of the body, these we surround with more abundant honour, and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For our comely parts have no need; but God hath tempered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that which lacked:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That there might be no schism in the body, but that the members might have the same care for each other:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whether one member suffer, all the members might suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members might rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God hath set in the church, first, apostles, secondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers: afterward miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, different kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? have all miraculous powers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But covet earnestly the best gifts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And yet I shew unto you a more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
