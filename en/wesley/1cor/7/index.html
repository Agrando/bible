For I would that all men were even as myself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but every one hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, another after that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But to the unmarried and the widows I say, It is good for them, if they remain even as I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they have not power over themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And let not the husband put away his wife. To the rest speak I, not the Lord. If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the wife, who hath an unbelieving husband, that consenteth to live with her, let her not put him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband hath been sanctified by the wife; and the unbelieving wife hath been sanctified by the husband. Else were your children unclean; but now they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbeliever will depart, let him depart: a brother or a sister is not inslaved in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how knowest thou, O wife, but thou mayst save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, but thou mayst save thy wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as God hath distributed to every one, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And thus I ordain in all the churches. Is any one called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any one called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let every one in the calling wherein he is called, therein abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou canst be made free, use it rather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he that is called by the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman; and in like manner, he that is called being free, is the servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ye are bought with a price; do not become the servants of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brethren, let every one wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one who hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I apprehend therefore, that this is good for the present distress, that it is good for a man to continue as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed: art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet if thou dost marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh; but I spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that even they that have wives, be as if they had none: And they that weep, as if they wept not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and they that buy, as if they possessed not; And they that use this world, as not abusing it; for the fashion of this world passeth away: Now I would have you without carefulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The unmarried man careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the married careth for the things of the world , how he may please his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit: but the married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I say for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but that ye may decently wait upon the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any think that he acteth indecently toward his virgin, if she be above age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power over his own will, and hath determined this in his heart to keep his virgin, doth well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then he also that giveth in marriage, doth well; but he that giveth not in marriage, doth better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The wife is bound as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to marry whom she will; only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier, if she continue as she is, in my judgment; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
