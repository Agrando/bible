For he hath put all things under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when he saith, All things are put under him, it is manifest that he who did put all things under him is excepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when all things shall be put under him, then shall the Son himself also be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Else what shall they do, who are baptized for the dead? If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Why are we also in danger every hour? I protest by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If after the manner of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be not deceived. Evil communications corrupt good manners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will say, How are the dead raised? And with what body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat, or of any other corn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to each of the seeds, its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one kind of flesh of men, another of beasts, another of fishes, another of birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are also heavenly, and there are earthly bodies: but the glory of the heavenly is one, and that of the earthly another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: and one star differeth from another star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also is the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And so it is written, The first Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam is a quickening Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Yet the spiritual body was not first, but the animal; afterward the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man was from the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As was the earthy, such are they also that are earthy, and as was the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory; The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But thanks be to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
