These were bought from among men: first-fruits to God and the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And in their mouth there was found no guile: they are without fault.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having an everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and tribe, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and fountains of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another angel followed, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen; she that hath made all nations drink of the wine of her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one worship the wild beast and his image, and receive his mark on his forehead or on his head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured unmixt into the cup of his indignation, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever, and they have no rest day or night, who worship the wild beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying to me, Write: From henceforth happy are the dead who die in the Lord: Yea (saith the Spirit) that they may rest from their labours. Their works follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I saw and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud sat one like a son of man, having a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle and reap; for the time to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle, and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven; and he also had a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another angel from the altar, who had power over fire, cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel thrust in his sickle upon the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the wine-press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine-press, even to the horses bridles, one thousand six hundred furlongs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
