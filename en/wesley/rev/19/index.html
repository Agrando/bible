And he saith to me, These are the true sayings of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell before his feet to worship him: but he saith to me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sitteth on him, called Faithful and True: and in righteousness he judgeth and maketh war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems, and he hath a name written, which none knoweth but himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he is clothed in a vesture dipt in blood, and his name is called, The Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in clean, fine linen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And out of his mouth goeth forth a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he may smite the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together to the great supper of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chief captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those that sit on them, and the flesh of all men both bond and free, both small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together, to make war with him that sat on the horse and with his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the wild beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought the miracles before him, with which he deceived them who had the mark of the wild beast, and them who had worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which went forth out of his mouth; and all the birds were satisfied with their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
