And he saith to me, Write: these sayings are faithful and true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsteth of the fountain of the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be to him a God, and he shall be to me a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven phials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Having the glory of God: her window was like the most precious stone, like a jasper stone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>clear as crystal, Having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and the names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: On the east three gates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the walls of the city had twelve foundations, and upon them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he that talked with me had a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the walls thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the city lyeth four-square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs: the length, and the breadth, and the height of it, are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred forty-four reeds, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the building of the wall thereof was jasper, and the city was of pure gold, like clear glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was a jasper, the second a sapphire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the third a chalcedony, the fourth an emerald, The fifth a sardonyx, the sixth a sardius, the seventh a chrysolite, the eighth a beryl, the ninth a topaz, the tenth a chrysophrase, the eleventh a jacinth, the twelfth an amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine on it; for the glory of God hath inlightened it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the nations shall walk by the light thereof; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the gates of it shall not be shut by day: and there shall be no night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But there shall in no wise enter into it any thing common, or that worketh abomination, or maketh a lie, but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
