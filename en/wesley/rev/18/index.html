Thou great city Babylon, thou strong city! In one hour is thy judgment come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her; for none buyeth their merchandize any more; Merchandize of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all sorts of thyine wood, and all sorts of vessels of ivory, and all sorts of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And cinnamon, and amomum, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep; and merchandize of horses and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the fruits which thy soul desireth are departed from thee, and all things that were dainty and splendid are perished from thee and thou shalt find them no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The merchants of these things who became rich by her, shall stand afar off, for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, Saying, alas, alas!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The great city that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stone, and pearl: in one hour so great riches are become desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And every ship-master, and all the company belonging to ships, and sailors, and all who trade by sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>stood afar off, And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city was like the great city?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas! The great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her costliness; for in one hour she is made desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and apostles, and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mill-stone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee, and no artificer of any kind shall be found any more in thee, and the sound of a mill-stone shall be heard no more at all in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee, and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more in thee: for thy merchants, were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was found the blood of prophets, and saints, and of all that had been slain upon the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
