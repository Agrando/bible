And Jesus saith to them, Yea: have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning, as he was returning to the city he hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And seeing a fig-tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only. And he saith to it, Let no fruit grow on thee hence-forward for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And presently the fig-tree withered away. And the disciples seeing it marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig-tree withered away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answering said to them, Verily I say to you, if ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only do this to the fig-tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou lifted up, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority dost thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answering said to them, I will also ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I will likewise tell you, by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven, or of men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, from heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we say, Of men: we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answering said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither tell I you, by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But what think you? A man had two sons; and coming to the first, he said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He answering said, I will not; but afterward repenting, he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And coming to the other, he said likewise. And he answered, I go Sir: but went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say to you, the publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him. And ye seeing it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another parable. There was a certain housholder, who planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the husbandmen taking his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again he sent other servants more than the first; and they did to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Last of all he sent to them his Son, saying, They will reverence my Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the husbandmen seeing the Son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come let us kill him and seize on his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And taking him, they cast him out of the vineyard and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When therefore the Lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen who will render him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus saith to them, Have ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, is become the head of the corner? This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the chief priests and the Pharisees, hearing his parables, knew he spoke of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But when they sought to apprehend him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
