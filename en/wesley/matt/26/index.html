For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For in pouring this ointment on my body, she hath done it for my burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Verily I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, this also which she hath done shall be spoken for a memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, going to the chief priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they bargained with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On tbe first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master saith, My time is at hand: I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the evening was come, he sat down with the twelve. And as they ate he said, Verily I say to you, One of you will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they were exceeding sorrowful and began each of them to say to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Lord, Is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he answering said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas who betrayed him answering said, Master, Is it I? He saith to him, Thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after they had eaten, Jesus took bread and blessed and brake and gave it to his disciples and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he took the cup, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many, for the remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till the day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when they had sung the hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then saith Jesus to them, All ye will be offended at me this night, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter answering said to him, Tho' all should be offended at thee, I will never be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, before cock-crowing thou wilt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter saith to him, If I must die with thee, yet will I in no wise deny thee. In like manner also said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and in deep anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then saith he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, What! Could ye not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing; but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again the second time he went away and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup cannot pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he came and found them asleep again; for their eyes were weighed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And leaving them, he went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then cometh he to his disciples and saith to them, Sleep on now and take your rest: Behold the hour is come, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise; let us be going: behold he that betrayeth me is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he was yet speaking, lo Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now he that betrayed him, had given them a signal, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, is he; seize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said, Hail, Master, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said to him, Friend, Wherefore art thou come? Then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching out his hand, drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said Jesus to him, Put up again thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword, shall perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Thinkest thou that I cannot now ask my Father, and he will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour Jesus said to the multitude, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye took me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this is done, that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they that had apprehended Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest's palace, and going in, sat with the officers, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council sought false witness against Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>to put him to death, But found none; yea, tho' many false witnesses came, yet found they none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>At last came two false witnesses, And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest rising up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, to tell us, if thou art the Christ, the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus saith to him, Thou hast said. Moreover I say to you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right-hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? Behold now ye have heard his blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What think ye? They answering said, He is guilty of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then did they spit in his face and buffet him, and others smote him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter sat without in the hall. And one of the maid-servants came to him saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied before all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a while they that stood by, came and said to Peter, Surely thou art also one of them; for thy speech discovereth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said to him, Before cock-crowing thou wilt deny me thrice. And he went out and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
