And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lo, I have told you. And departing quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy they ran to tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold Jesus met them and said, Hail. And they came, and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then saith Jesus to them, Fear not. Go tell my brethren to go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While they were going, behold some of the guard coming into the city, told the chief priests all the things that had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And having met together with the elders and taken counsel, they gave large mony to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Saying, Say his disciples came by night, and stole him while we slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this come to the governour's ears, we will persuade him and secure you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were taught; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews till this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him they worshiped him, tho' some had doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came and spake to them, saying, All power is given me in heaven and in earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go ye and disciple all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
