What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a writing of divorce and put her away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He saith to them, Because of the hardness of your hearts, Moses suffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, whosoever shall put away his wife, except for whoredom, and marry another, committeth adultery, and whoso marrieth her that is put away, committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples say to him, If the case of a man with his wife be so, it is not expedient to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs, who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then were brought to him little children, that he should lay his hands on them and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he laid his hands on them and departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He saith to him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder: thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honour thy father and mother, and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept from my childhood: what lack I yet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus saith to him, If thou desirest to be perfect, go, sell what thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the young man, hearing that saying, went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said Jesus to his disciples, Verily I say to you, a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go thro' the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>His disciples hearing it, were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Oesus looking upon them, said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then answered Peter and said to him, Behold we have forsaken all, and followed thee. What shall we have therefore?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, that ye who have followed me, in the renovation, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my names sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and inherit everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many first shall be last, and the last shall be first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
