And they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again going out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And going out about the eleventh hour, he found others standing idle and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right ye shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in the evening the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last to the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when they came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every one a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every one a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And having received it, they murmured against the housholder, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>These last have wrought one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he answering said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take what is thine, and go: it is my will, to give to this last, even as to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Is it not lawful for me, to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many are called, but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles, to mock and scourge and crucify him; and the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshiping him and desiring a certain thing of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to her, What wilt thou? She saith to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right-hand, and the other on thy left in thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink of, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he saith to them, Ye shall indeed drink of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right-hand and on my left is not mine to give, save to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus calling them to him said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It shall not be so among you; but whosoever desireth to be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever desireth to be chief among you, let him be your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Even as the Son of man came not to be served,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as they were going from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold two blind men sitting by the way-side, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the multitude charged them to hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus standing still called them and said, What do ye desire that I should do to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jesus moved with tender compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
