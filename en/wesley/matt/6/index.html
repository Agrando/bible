Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when thou dost alms, let not thy left-hand know what thy right-hand doth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That thy alms may be in secret, and thy father who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when thou prayest, thou shall not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may appear to men: verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens; for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be not therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus therefore pray ye, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us this day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast: verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thou when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That thou appear not unto men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break thro' and steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break thro' nor steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The eye is the light of the body: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness: if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will cleave to the one and neglect the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take not thought for your life, what ye shall eat, nor for the body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold the birds of the air: they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Are ye not much better than they? And which of you by taking thought can add to his age the smallest measure?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now: if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the still, will he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore take not thought, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or what shall we wear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(For after all these things do the heathens seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye need all these things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Take not therefore thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for itself: sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
