And as they came down from the mountain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen again from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes, That Elijah must come first?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus answering said to them, Elijah truly doth come first, and regulate all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I say to you, That Elijah is come already, and they acknowledged him not, but have done to him whatever they listed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So shall also the Son of man suffer from them. Then the disciples understood, that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>kneeling down to him, and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic, and suffereth grievously; for often he falleth into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to thy disciples, but they could not cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Bring him hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil, and he went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples coming to Jesus apart said, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For verily I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustardseed, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Howbeit this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will kill him, and the third day he shall rise again: and they were exceeding sorry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the tribute-mony came to Peter and said, Doth not your master pay the tribute?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He saith, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Of their own sons, or of strangers? Peter saith to him, Of strangers. Jesus saith to him, Then are the sons free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yet that we may not offend them, go to the sea, and cast an hook, and take the fish that first cometh up. And when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money. That take and give them for me and thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
