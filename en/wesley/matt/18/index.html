If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them go astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine and go into the mountains, and seek that which is gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoiceth more over that sheep, than over the ninety and nine which went not astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if thy brother shall sin against thee, go and tell him his fault, between thee and him alone: if he will hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he will not hear, take with thee one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he will not hear them, tell it to the church; but if he will not hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen and a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth, touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then came Peter to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Till seven times? Jesus saith to him, I say not unto thee, till seven times, but till seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king, who was minded to settle accounts with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the servant falling prostrate at his feet, said, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the lord of that servant, moved with tender compassion, loosed him and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But that servant going out, found one of his fellow-servants who owed him an hundred pence, and seized him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And his fellow-servant falling at his feet, besought him saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But his fellow-servants, seeing what was done, were very sorry, and came and gave their lord an exact account of the whole matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord calling him, said to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou intreatedst me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Should'st not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, as I had pity on thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his lord being wroth, delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So likewise will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
