O ye hypocrites, ye know to discern the face of the sky: can ye not discern the signs of the times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh a sign; but there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Saducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We have taken no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus knowing it said to them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have taken no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do ye not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How do ye not understand, that I spake not to you concerning bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Saducees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood, that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Saducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus coming into the coasts of Cesarea Philippi, asked his disciples saying, Whom do men say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Son of man? And they said, Some say, John the Baptist, others Elijah; others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He saith to them, But whom say ye that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering said to him, Happy art thou, Simon Barjonah; for flesh and blood have not revealed this to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I say also to thee, Thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then charged he his disciples, to tell no one, that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time Jesus began to shew his disciples, That he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Peter taking hold of him, rebuked him, saying, Favour thyself, Lord: this shall in no wise be unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he turning said to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me: for thou savourest not the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man be willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give, in exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then shall he render to every man according to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Verily I say to you, there are some standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
