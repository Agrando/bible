The gold? Or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And whosoever shall swear by the altar, ye say, it is nothing: but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, is bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye fools and blind; for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it and by all things thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to have neglected the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish; but within they are full of rapine and intemperance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first, the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye are like whited sepulchres, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So ye likewise outwardly appear righteous to men; but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchres of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Wherefore ye testify against yourselves, that ye are the sons of them who killed the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye brood of vipers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wherefore behold I send to you prophets, and wise-men, and scribes; and some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous, to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Verily I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them who are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a bird gathereth her young under her wings; and ye would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold your house is left unto you desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I say to you, ye shall not see me from this time, till ye say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
