And the feast was abundantly supplied with guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the king coming in to see the guests, saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then went the Pharisees and consulted, how to insnare him in his talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth; neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Shew me the tribute-mony. And they brought to him a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He saith to them, Whose is this image and superscription?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They say to him, Cesar's. Then said he to them, Render therefore to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And hearing it they marvelled. And they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day came the Saducees, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were with us seven brethren, and the first, having married a wife died, and having no issue, left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For they all had her. Jesus answering said to them, Ye err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For in the resurrection,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God is not a God of the dead, but of the living. And the multitude hearing it, were astonished at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees having heard, that he had silenced the Saducees, were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one of them, a scribe, asked him a question,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>trying him and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>On these two commandments</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>hang all the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, Saying, What think ye of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Whose son is he? They say to him, David's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He saith to them, How doth David then by the Spirit call him Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Saying, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my righthand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any from that day question him any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
