And if ye had known what that meaneth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And departing thence, he went into their synagogue. And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, What man is there among you, that shall have one sheep, who if it fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold on it and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus knowing it withdrew from thence; and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And charged them, not to make him known: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold my servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delighteth: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the heathens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall not strive nor clamour, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He shall not break a bruised reed, and smoking flax he shall not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name shall the heathens trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb; and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the multitude were amazed and said, Is not this the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the Pharisees hearing it said, This fellow casteth not out devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself: how then shall his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if it be by the Spirit of God that I cast out devils, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>How can one enter into the strong one's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then he will plunder his house. He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Wherefore I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whosoever speaketh against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye brood of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A good man out of the good treasure bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I say to you, That every idle word which men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, or by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign, and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold a greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it; for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold a greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he saith, I will return to my house whence I came out, and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then goeth he and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there, and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it be also to this wicked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he yet talked to the multitude, behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And one said to him, Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he answering said to him that told him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And stretching forth his hand toward his disciples he said, Behold my mother and my brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
