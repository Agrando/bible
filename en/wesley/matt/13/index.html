When any one heareth the word of the kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and considereth it not, the wicked one cometh, and catcheth away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the way-side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he who received the seed in stony places, is he that heareth the word, and immediately receiveth it with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet hath he not root in himself, and so endureth but for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straight-way he is offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He that received the seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word: and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that received seed on the good ground, is he that heareth the word and considereth it: who also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth some an hundred fold, some sixty, some thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He proposed to them another parable, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man sowing good seed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amidst the wheat, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the darnel also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the servants of the housholder came to him and said, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? Whence then hath it darnel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said to him, Wilt thou then, that we go and gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, No: lest gathering up the darnel, ye root up the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Suffer both to grow together till the harvest; and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the darnel, and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He proposed to them another parable, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest of herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He spake another parable to them: the kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman taking, covered up in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things spake Jesus to the multitude in parables, and without a parable spake he not unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Whereby was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hid from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus having sent the multitude away, went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Declare to us the parable of the darnel of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answering said to them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the darnel are the children of the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The enemy that sowed them is the devil: the harvest is the end of the world; the reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As therefore the darnel are gathered and burnt with fire, so shall it be in the end of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which a man having found hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who having found one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea, and gathering of every kind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Which when it was full, they drew to the shore, and sitting down, gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus saith to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then saith he to them, Therefore every scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like an housholder, who bringeth out of his treasure things new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence: And coming into his own country,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, Whence hath HE this wisdom and these mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brethren, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath HE all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were offended at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he wrought not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
