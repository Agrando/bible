And Jesus saith to him, See thou tell no man, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>beseeching him, and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the house, ill of the palsy, grievously tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus saith to him, I will come and heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy, that thou shouldst come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus said to the centurion, Go thy way, and as thou hast believed, be it to thee. And his servant was healed in that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus coming into Peter's house, saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and waited upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When it was evening, they brought to him many demoniacs; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were ill:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Whereby was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our diseases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus seeing great multitudes about him, commanded to go to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a certain scribe came and said to him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus saith to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the deadto bury their dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he was come into the vessel, his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the vessel was covered with the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he was asleep. And his disciples coming to him awoke him, saying, Lord, save us; we perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he saith to them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then arising, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and seas obey him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And behold they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Art thou come hither to torment us before the time? And there was afar off from them an herd of many swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, Go. And coming out, they went into the herd of swine, and behold the whole herd rushed down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But they that kept them fled, and going into the city, told every thing, and what had befallen the demoniacs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And behold the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and seeing him, they besought him, to depart out of their coasts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
