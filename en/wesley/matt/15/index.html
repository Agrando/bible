But he answering said, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God thro' your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God commanded, Honour thy father and mother: and He that revileth father or mother, let him die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest have been profited by me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let him not honour his father or his mother. Thus have ye made void the command of God thro' your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophecy of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people draweth nigh to me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And calling the multitudes he said to them, Hear and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the man, but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then came his disciples and said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees, hearing this saying, were offended?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind: but if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a ditch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then answered Peter and said to him, Declare to us this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not ye yet understand, that whatever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the vault?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those things which proceed out of the mouth, come out of the heart, and they defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things which defile a man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus going thence, retired to the coast of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold a woman of Canaan, of those coasts, came and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answering said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then came she and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he answering said, It is not right, to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And she said, True, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus answering said to her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus passing thence, came nigh the sea of Galilee; and going up into a mountain, he sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, disabled, and many others; and cast them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that the multitudes wondered, seeing the dumb to speak, the disabled whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus calling his disciples to him said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I am not willing to send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so much bread in a wilderness, as to satisfy so great a multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They said, Seven, and a few small fishes. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, he gave thanks and brake them and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up of the fragments that remained seven baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having sent away the multitude, he took ship again, and came into the coasts of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
