And being before instructed by her mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>she said, Give me here John the Baptist's head in a charger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king was sorry; yet for the oath's sake, and them who sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he sent and beheaded John in the prison. And his head was brought in a charger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and given to the damsel, and she carried it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his disciples came and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus hearing it, withdrew thence by ship into a desert place apart: but when the people heard thereof, they followed him by land out of the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And going forth he saw a great multitude, and was moved with tender compassion for them, and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in the evening his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past: send the multitude away, that going into the villages, they may buy themselves victuals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them, They need not go: give ye them to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say to him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, Bring them hither to me. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all ate and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they that had eaten were about five thousand, beside women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he constrained his disciples, to go straightway into the vessel, and go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitude away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having sent the multitude away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in the evening, he was there alone: but the vessel was now in the midst of the sea, tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the disciples seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition: and they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus immediately spake to them, saying, Take courage: it is I: be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Come. And Peter coming down from the vessel, walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, Lord, save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately Jesus reaching forth his hand, caught him, and saith to him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they were come into the vessel, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they that were in the vessel, came and worshiped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having crossed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought to him all that were diseased; And besought him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
