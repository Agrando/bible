A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that wear soft clothing, are in king's houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he of whom it is written, Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily I say unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the days of John the Baptist till now, the kingdom of heaven is entered by force, and they which strive with all their might take it by violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if ye are willing to receive him, this is Elijah, who was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But whereto shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and calling to their fellows, And saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to tou, and ye have not lamented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He hath a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of man is come eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners; but wisdom is justified by her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then began he to upbraid the cities, wherein most of his mighty works had been done, because they repented not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wo to thee, Chorazin, wo to thee, Bethsaida: for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou, Capernaum, who hast been exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained till this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any one the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
