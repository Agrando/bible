See thou to it. And having thrown down the pieces of silver in the temple, he withdrew and went and hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the chief priests taking the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And having consulted together, they bought with them the potters field, to bury foreigners in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And gave them for the potters field, as the Lord commanded me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus stood before the governour. And the governour questioned him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said Pilate to him, Hearest thou not, how many things they witness against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he answered him to never a word, so that the governour marvelled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now at the feast the governour was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they had then a notorious prisoner, named Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While he sat on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things to-day in a dream because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude, to ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The governour answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They say, Barabbas. Pilate saith to them, What shall I do then with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the governour said, Why, what evil hath he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. Then Pilate, seeing, that he could prevail nothing, but rather a tumult was made, took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man: see ye to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then all the people answering said, His blood be on us and on our children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then released he Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the soldiers of the governour, taking Jesus into the common hall, gathered to him the whole troop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a cane in his right-hand; and kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And spitting on him, they took the cane and smote him on the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And coming out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And coming to a place called Golgotha, that is, the place of a skull, They gave him vinegar mingled with gall to drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they crucified him and parted his garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And sitting down, they guarded him there, And set up over his head his accusation written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then were two thieves crucified with him, one on the right-hand and one on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that were passing by reviled him, wagging their heads and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son God, come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In like manner the chief priests also with the scribes and elders mocking him said, He saved others; Cannot he save himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>If he be the king of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God: let him deliver him now if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And even the robbers that were crucified with him, cast the same reproach upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth, unto the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama-sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Some of them that stood there hearing it, said, He calleth Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge filled it with vinegar, and put it on a cane, and gave him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The rest said, Let be: let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus after he had cried again with a loud voice, dismissed his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken and the rocks were torn asunder: And the tombs were opened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and many bodies of holy men that slept were raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the centurion and they that were with him, guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that were done, feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And many women were there, beholding afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>He going to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus: then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it in clean linen, And laid it in his own new tomb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>which he had hewn out in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Mary Magdalene was there and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Saying, Sir, we remember, that impostor said while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured till the third day, lest his disciples coming steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last imposture shall be worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate said to them, Ye have a guard; go, make it as secure as ye can.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So they went and secured the sepulchre, sealing the stone, and setting a guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
