And if the house be worthy, your peace shall come upon it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but if it be not worthy, your peace shall return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words; when ye go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But beware of men; for they will deliver you to the councils, and scourge you in their synagogues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the heathens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they deliver you, take no thought, how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that very hour what ye shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of the Father who speaketh in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and children shall rise up against their parents, and kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end, shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when they persecute you in this city, flee to another; for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his houshold? Therefore fear them not; for there is nothing covered, that shall not be discovered; nor hid, that shall not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I tell you in darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim on the house-tops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And be not afraid of them who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yea, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I am not come to send peace, but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I am come to set a man at variance with his father, and the daughter with her mother, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the foes of a man shall be they of his own houshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me, and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He that findeth his life, shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it. He that entertaineth you, entertaineth me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and he that entertaineth me, entertaineth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He that entertaineth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward: and he that entertaineth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
