For with what judgment ye judge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And why beholdest thou the mote in thy brother's eye, but observest not the beam in thine own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote from thine eye, and behold a beam is in thine own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turning, rend you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What man is there of you, who if his son ask bread, will give him a stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Enter ye in thro' the straight gate: for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are that go in thro' it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there are that find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name have done many wonderful works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then will I declare to them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore whosoever heareth these my sayings, and doth them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock: And the rain descended,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell not; for it was founded on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But every one that heareth these my sayings, and doth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when Jesus had ended these sayings, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching, For he taught them as one having authority,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and not as the scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
