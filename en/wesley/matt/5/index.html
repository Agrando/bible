It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye are the light of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A city that is situated on a mountain cannot be hid. Neither do they light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all things be effected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments and teach men so, shall be the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and each them, he shall be great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say to you, That unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt do no murder, and whosoever doth murder, shall be liable to the judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be liable to the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to hell-fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember, that thy brother hath ought against thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Leaving thy gift there before the altar, go; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt in no wise come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ye have heard, that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if thy right-hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of Divorce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, save for the cause of whoredom, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away, committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Again, ye have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform thine oaths unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head; for thou canst not make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your conversation be yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say unto you, that ye resist not the evil man: but whosoever shall smite thee on the right-cheek, turn to him the other also;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if a man will sue thee and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whosoever shall compel thee to go with him one mile, go with him twain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him that asketh thee, and him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Ye have heard, that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the heathens so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Therefore ye shall be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
