Or to say, Arise and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the paralytic) Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he arose and went to his own house. And the multitude seeing it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>marvelled, and glorified God, who had given such power to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as Jesus passed along from thence, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the receit of custom, and saith to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as Jesus sat at table in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with him and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples, Why eateth your master with publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Jesus hearing it, said to them, They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice; for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples fast not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus said, Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bride-groom is with them? But the days will come, when the bride-groom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No man putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: for that which is put in to fill it; taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither do men put new wine into old leather bottles, else the bottles burst, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are destroyed, but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he spake these things to them, behold a certain ruler coming worshiped him, saying, My daughter is even now dying: but come and lay thine hand on her, and she shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(And behold a woman who had had a flux of blood, twelve years, coming behind him, touched the hem of his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she said within herself, if I but touch his garment, I shall be whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus turning and seeing her, said, Daughter, take courage; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus coming into the ruler's house, and seeing the minstrels and the croud who cried out aloud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saith to them, Withdraw; for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth: and they derided him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the people were put forth, he went in and took her by the hand; and the maid arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the fame of it went abroad into all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Jesus passed thence, two blind men followed him, crying and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith to them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yea, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he touched their eyes, saying, Be it unto you, according to your faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But when they were gone out, they spread his fame in all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they were going out, behold men brought a dumb demoniac to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the devil were cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never seen thus, even in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But seeing the multitudes he was moved with tender compassion for them, because they were faint and scattered, as sheep having no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then saith he to his disciples, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
