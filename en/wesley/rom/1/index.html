Therefore God gave them up to vile affections; for even their women changed the natural use to that which is against nature: And likewise also the men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>leaving the natural use of the women, burned in their lust toward each other, men with men working filthiness, and receiving in themselves the just recompence of their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And as they were not careful to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an undiscerning mind, to do things not expedient, Filled with all injustice, maliciousness, covetousness, wickedness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Whisperers, backbiters: haters of God, violent, proud: boasters, inventers of evil things: disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that do them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
