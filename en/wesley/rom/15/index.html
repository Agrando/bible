For it hath</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a collection for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It hath pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have partook of their spiritual things, they ought to minister to them in carnal things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When therefore I have performed this, and sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>in your prayers to God for me, That I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service at Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the God of peace be with you all.
