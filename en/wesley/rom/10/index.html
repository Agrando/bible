The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart, that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with the heart man believeth to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the scripture saith, Every one that believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord of all, is rich to all that call upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But how shall they preach, unless they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them who bring the good tidings of peace, who bring the glad tidings of good things!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But all have not obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily; their voice is gone into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Hath not Israel known? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a nation; by a foolish nation I will anger you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Isaiah is very bold and saith, I was found by them that sought me not: I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whereas with regard to Israel he saith, All the day have I stretched forth my hands to an unbelieving and gainsaying people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
