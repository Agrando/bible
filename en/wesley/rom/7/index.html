That the law is sin? God forbid. Yea, I should not have known sin, but for the law. I had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of desire: for without the law sin was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I was once alive without the law; but when the commandment came,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>sin revived, and I died, And the commandment, which was intended for life, this I found unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid: But sin: so that it appeared sin, working death in me by that which is good: so that sin might by the commandment become exceeding sinful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that which I do I approve not; for what I would, I do not, but what I hate, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If then I do what I would not, I consent to the law, that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good, I find not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and captivating me to the law of sin, which is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wretched man that I am!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with my mind serve the law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
