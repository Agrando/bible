God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God hath not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thy altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what saith the answer of God to him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And so likewise at the present time, there is a remnant, according to the election of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if by grace, then it is no more of works: else grace is no longer grace. And if it be of works, then it is no more grace; else work is no longer work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh, but the election hath obtained, and the rest were blinded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According as it is written, God hath given them a spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David saith, Let their table become a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say then, Have they stumbled so as to fall? God forbid. But by their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if their fall be the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I speak to you Gentiles, as I am the apostle of the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I magnify my office: If by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what will the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the first-fruits be holy, so is the lump: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if some of the branches were broken off, and thou being a wild olive wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the good olive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Boast not against the branches, but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wilt thou say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Well; they were broken off for unbelief, and thou standest by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Be not high-minded, but fear. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed left he also spare not thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God! Toward them that fell severity; but toward thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: else shalt thou also be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if thou wert cut off from the naturally wild olive-tree, and grafted contrary to nature into a good olive-tree; how much more shall these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive-tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits) that hardness is in part happened to Israel, till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Sion, and shall turn away iniquity from Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>With regard to the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as for the election, they are beloved, for the sake of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As then ye were once disobedient to God, but have now obtained mercy through their disobedience:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So these also have now been disobedient, that through your mercy they may likewise find mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God hath shut up all together in disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O the depth of the riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who hath first given to him, and it shall be repaid him again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to him be glory for ever! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
