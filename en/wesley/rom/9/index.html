Is there injustice with God? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It is not therefore of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover the scripture saith to Pharoah, For this very thing have I raised thee up, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may be declared through all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then he hath mercy on whom he willeth, and whom he willeth, he hardneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But thou wilt say to me, Why doth he still find fault?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For who hath resisted his will? Nay, but who art thou, O man, that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hath not the potter power over the clay, out of the same mass to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What if God, being willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, yet endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, whom he had before prepared for glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Even us whom he hath called, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, who were not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall come to pass, in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the sons of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah likewise crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant only shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Lord is finishing and cutting short his account in righteousness; for the Lord will make a short account upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as Isaiah had said before, Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and had been made like Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles who followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel following after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Wherefore? Because they sought it, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they stumbled at that stumbling stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As it is written, Behold I lay in Sion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence: and every one that believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
