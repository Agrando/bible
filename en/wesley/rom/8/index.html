And if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, will also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The same Spirit beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by him who subjected it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In hope that the creation itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation groaneth together and travaileth together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only they, but even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, how doth he yet hope for?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we see not, we patiently wait for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he who searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit: for he maketh intercession for the saints, according to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know, that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated, conformable to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And whom he predestinated, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What shall we say then to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is also at the right-hand of God, who likewise maketh intercession for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>(As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nay, in all these things we more than conquer, through him who hath loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
