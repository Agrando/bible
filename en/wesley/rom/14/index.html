To his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be upheld; for God is able to establish him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike; let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord; for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself. But if we live, we live unto the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whether therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ both died and lived again, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us therefore no longer judge one another; but judge this rather, not to lay a stumbling block, or a scandal before a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am assured by the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: but to him that accounteth any thing to be unclean, it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if thy brother is grieved by thy meat, thou no longer walkest charitably. Destroy not him by thy meat, for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore let not your good be evil spoken of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he that in these serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let us therefore pursue the things that tend to peace, and to mutual edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure: but it is evil to that man who eateth with offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good, not to eat flesh, neither to drink wine, nor to do any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or made weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because it is not of faith; for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
