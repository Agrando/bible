Shall their unbelief disannul the faithfulness of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>God forbid: let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is not God unjust, who taketh vengeance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I speak as a man. God forbid; for then how should God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the truth of God hath abounded to his glory through my lie, why am I still judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And why may we not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm us to say) do evil, that good may come? Whose damnation is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Are we better than they? In no wise: for we have before proved all, both Jews and Gentiles, to be under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have all turned aside; they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and misery are in their ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they have not known the way of peace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The fear of God is not before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that whatsoever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be found guilty before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore no flesh shall be justified in his sight by the works of the law; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the righteousness of God without the law is now manifested, being attested by the law and the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even the righteousness of God, by the faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all that believe; for there is no difference:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all have sinned, and are fallen short of the glory of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And are justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom God hath set forth as a propitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness by the remission of past sins, through the forbearance of God: For a demonstration,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I say, of his righteousness in this present time, that he might be just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nay, but by the law of faith. We conclude then, that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is God the God of the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles? Surely of the Gentiles also: Seeing it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the uncircumcision through the same faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
