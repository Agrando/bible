Fulfil ye my joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that ye think the same thing, having the same love, being of one soul, of one mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do nothing through strife or vain-glory, but in lowliness of mind, esteem each the others better than themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look not every one at his own things, but every one also at the things of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above every name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That at the name of Jesus every knee might bow, of those in heaven, and those on earth, and those under the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every tongue might confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it is God that worketh in you according to his good pleasure, both to will and to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That ye may be blameless and simple, the sons of God, unrebukable, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Holding fast the word of life, that I may glory in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the same cause joy ye likewise, and rejoice with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I trust in the Lord Jesus, to send Timotheus to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged, when I know your state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have none like-minded, who will naturally care for what concerneth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all seek their own, not the things of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with his father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him therefore I hope to send, as soon as ever I know how it will go with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I trust in the Lord, that I also myself shall come shortly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and companion in labour and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, and him that ministered to my need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He was indeed sick nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me likewise, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have sent him therefore the more willingly, that ye seeing him again may rejoice, and that I also may be the less sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and honour such.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his own life, to supply your deficiency of service toward me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
