still every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>According to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also, Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I am to live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour, and what I should chuse, I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, for it is far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to remain in the flesh is more needful for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And being persuaded of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That your rejoicing for me may abound through Christ Jesus, by my presence with you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your behaviour be worthy the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear concerning you, that ye stand fast, in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also is of God. For to you it is given, with regard to Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Having the same conflict, which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
