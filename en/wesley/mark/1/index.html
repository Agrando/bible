And he was there in the wilderness forty days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>tempted by Satan, and was with the wild-beasts; and the angels served him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers) And Jesus said to them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And straightway leaving their nets, they followed him. And having gone thence a little farther,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were also in the vessel, mending their nets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he called them; and immediately leaving their father Zebedee in the vessel with the hired servants, they went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they go into Capernaum. And straightway on the sabbath, he went into the synagogue and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were astonished at his teaching; for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there was in their synagogue a man heaving an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying, Let us alone:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy one of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit having torn him, and cried with a loud noise, came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? What new teaching is this? For with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And immediately his fame went forth into all the country of Galilee round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And coming out of the synagogue, they entered forthwith into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Simon's wife's mother lay ill of a fever, and immediately they tell him of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came and taking her by the hand, lifted her up; and straightway the fever left her, and she waited on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And in the evening, when the sun was set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many that were ill of divers diseases, and cast out many devils, and suffered not the devils to say that they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out and departed into a desert place and prayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And having found him, they say to him, All men seek thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he saith to them, Let us go to the neighbouring towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore am I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there came to him a leper beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus, moved with tender compassion, putting forth his hand, touched him, and saith to him, I will; be thou clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having straitly charged him, he forthwith sent him away, And saith to him, See thou say nothing to any man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he going out published it much and blazed abroad the matter, so that he could no more openly enter into the city; but he was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
