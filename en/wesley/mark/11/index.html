Say, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they went and found the colt tied, without, in the street, and they loose him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And some of them that stood there said, What do ye, loosing the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they said to them, as Jesus had commanded; and they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him, and he sat on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they that went before, and they that followed after cried, saying, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh: Hosanna in the highest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple, and having looked round about upon all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the morrow, as they were coming from Bethany, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And seeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and coming to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not a season of figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he answering said to it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever: And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come to Jerusalem. And Jesus going into the temple, drove out them that bought and sold in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the mony-changers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the seats of them that sold doves, And suffered not that any one should carry any vessel thro' the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations an house of prayer? But ye have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when evening was come, he went out of the city. And passing by in the morning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter remembring, saith to him, Master, behold the fig-tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answering saith to them, Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For verily I say to you, Whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and cast into the sea, and not doubt in his heart, but believe that the things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I say to you, What things soever ye ask in prayer, believe that ye shall receive, and ye shall have them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any, that your Father who is in heaven, may forgive you also your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders come to him and say to him, By what authority dost thou these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And who gave thee authority to do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answering said to them, I also will ask you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Was the baptism of John of heaven or of men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, from heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we say, of men: they feared the people; for all accounted John, that he was indeed a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they answering say to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith to them, Neither tell I you, by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
