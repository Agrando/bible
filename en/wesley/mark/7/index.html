Do ye not perceive, That whatsoever entereth into a man from without, cannot defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth into the vault, purging all meats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the heart of man proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, envy, evil speaking, pride, foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evils come from within, and defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he arose and went thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And entring into an house, he would have had no man know it; but he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>having heard of him, came and fell at his feet, (The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation) and besought him to cast the devil out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be satisfied; for it is not right to take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>She answered and said to him, True, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to her, For this saying, go: the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And going to her house, she found the devil gone out and her daughter lying on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And departing again from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, thro' the midst of the country of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they bring to him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and beseech him to put his hand upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And taking him aside from the multitude, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking up to heaven, he groaned and saith to him, Ephphatha, that is, be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he charged them to tell no man; but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
