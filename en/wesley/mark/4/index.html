How then will ye know all parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower soweth the word. And these are they by the way-side, where the word is sown;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word sown in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these are they likewise who have received the seed on stony ground, who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy: But have not root in themselves, and so indure but for a time:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth because of the word, they are presently offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these are they that have received it among thorns,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who hear the word, And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And these are they that have received it on the good ground, who hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty fold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be cut under a bushel or under a bed, and not to be set on a candlestick?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested, neither was any thing kept secret, but that it might come abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you, and to you that hear, shall more be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he that hath, to him shall be given; but he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, after that, the full corn in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Whereto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which when it is sown in the earth, is one of the least of the seeds that are in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs, so that the birds of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables spake he the word to them, as they were able to hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But without a parable spake he not to them: and in private he expounded all things to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the same day, in the evening he saith to them, Let us go over to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having sent away the multitude, they take him as he was in the boat. And there were with him other little vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he was asleep on the pillow, in the stern of the boat. And they awake him and say to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace; be still. And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it, that ye have not faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
