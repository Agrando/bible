And he answering said to him, Thou sayst it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused him of many things; but he answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold how many things they witness against thee. But Jesus answered nothing any more, so that Pilate marvelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at every feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the multitude crying aloud, desired him to do as he had ever done for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy) But the chief priests stirred up the people to desire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that he would rather release Barabbas to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate answering said to them again, What will ye then that I do to him whom ye call the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cried out again, Crucify him. Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pilate, willing to satisfy the people, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Pretorium, and call together the whole troop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothe him with purple, and having platted a crown of thorns, put it about his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they saluted him, Hail, king of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they smote him on the oead with a cane, and spit upon him, and bowing their knees, did him homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who was passing by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they bring him to the place, Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he received it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, when they crucified him. And there was an inscription of his written over,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with him they crucify two thieves, one on his right-hand, and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they that passed by, reviled him, wagging their heads and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and buildest it in three days, Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In like manner also the chief priests mocking said one to another, with the scribes, He saved others; cannot he save himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. They also that were crucified with him reviled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one of them that stood by, hearing it said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one ran and filling a sponge with vinegar, put it on a cane, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the centurion, who stood over-against him, seeing that having so cried he expired, said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There were also women, beholding from afar, among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Who also when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered to him, and many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the evening being now come, (because it was the preparation, that is,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>the day before the sabbath) Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pilate marvelled that he was dead already: and calling to him the centurion, he asked, If he had been any while dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And having bought fine linen, he took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre, which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, beheld where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
