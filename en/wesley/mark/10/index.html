And he answering said to them, What did Moses command you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus answering said to them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this precept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they twain shall be one flesh; so then they are no more twain but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he saith to them, Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another, committeth adultery against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they brought little children to him that he might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those that brought them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus seeing it was much displeased and said to them, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And taking them up in his arms, he put his hands upon them and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as he was going out into the way, one running and kneeling to him, asked him, Good Master, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus saith to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he answering said to him, Master, all these have I kept from my childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus looking upon him, loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lackest: Go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me, taking up thy cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved; for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus looking round said to his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answering again saith to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go thro' the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were astonished out of measure, saying to each other, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus looking upon them said, With men it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter said to him, Lo, we have left all and followed thee. And Jesus answering said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Verily I say to you, there is none that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my sake and the gospel's,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he shall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions, and in the world to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many that are first shall be last, and the last first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them. And they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he told them what things should befall him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes: and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they will mock him and scourge him and spit upon him and kill him. And the third day he will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us what we shall ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said to him, Grant us to sit one on thy right-hand, and one on thy left-hand in thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But to sit on my right-hand and on my left, is not mine to give, but to them for whom it is prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the ten hearing it, were much displeased with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Jesus calling them, saith to them, Ye know that they who rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever desireth to be great among you, shall be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whosoever desireth to be the chief, shall be the servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they come to Jericho. And as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the way-side begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when he heard, It is Jesus of Nazareth, he cried out and said, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many charged him to hold his peace; but he cried so much the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jesus standing still, commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Take courage; rise; he calleth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And casting away his garment, he rose and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answering said to him, What wilt thou that I should do for thee? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said, Go; thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
