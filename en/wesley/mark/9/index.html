And one of the multitude answering said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Master, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away. And I spake to thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>How long shall I suffer you? Bring him to me. And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him, and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he asked his father, How long is it since this came to him? And he said, From a little child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it hath often cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him; but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus saith to him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And straightway the father of the child crying out, said with tears, Lord, I do believe: help thou mine unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus seeing that the multitude came running together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying, Thou deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having cried and rent him sore, he came out; and he was as dead, so that many said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus taking him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come into an house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And departing thence, they passed thro' Galilee, and he was not willing that any should know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he taught his disciples and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men; and they will kill him, and after he hath been killed, he shall rise the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he came to Capernaum. And being in the house, he asked them, What was it ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they held their peace; for they had been debating among themselves in the way, Who should be greatest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And sitting down, he called the twelve and saith to them, If any man desire to be first, let him be the last of all, and the servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And taking a little child, he set him in the midst of them, and embracing him he said to them, Whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not only me, but him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, who followeth not us, and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, who can readily speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For he that is not against you, is for you. For whosoever shall give you a cup of cold water to drink in my name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>because ye belong to Christ, verily I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whosoever shall offend one of the little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>it is good for thee, to enter into the kingdom of God having one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
