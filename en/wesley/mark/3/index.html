To save life or to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they held their peace. And looking round upon them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharisees going out, straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what great things he did, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spake to his disciples, that a boat should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he had healed many, so that they rushed in upon him, as many as had plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he straitly charged them, not to make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth to him whom he would, and they came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he ordained twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And to have power to heal diseases and to cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Simon he surnamed Peter: And James the son of Zebedee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and John the brother of James (and he surnamed them Boanerges,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that is, the sons of thunder) And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Simon the Canaanite, And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they come into an house: And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his relations hearing of it, came out to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And calling them to him, he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if an house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If Satan then be risen up and divided against himself, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>None can enter into the strong one's house and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong one, and then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven the sons of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is liable to eternal damnation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then come his brethren and his mother, and standing without, sent to him, calling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking round on them who sat about him, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother and sister and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
