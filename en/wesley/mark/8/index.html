And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, having given thanks, he brake and gave to his disciples to set before them: and they did set them before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded, to set them also before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they did eat and were satisfied; and they took up of the fragments that were left, seven baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And straightway going into the boat with his disciples he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Pharisees came forth and questioned with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, Why doth this generation seek a sign? Verily I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he left them and taking boat again, went to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now they had forgotten to take bread; nor had they in the boat with them any more than one loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he charged them, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We have no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus knowing it saith to them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? Perceive ye not yet, neither consider? Have ye your heart yet hardened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Having eyes, see ye not? And having ears, hear ye not? And do not ye remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said, Seven. And he said to them, How is it, that ye do not understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he cometh to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town, and having spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him, If he saw ought?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And looking up he said, I see men, as trees walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he put his hands again on his eyes and made him look up, and he was restored and saw all men clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of Cesarea Philippi. And in the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Whom do men say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he saith to them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answering saith to him, Thou art the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he spake that saying openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Peter taking hold of him, rebuked him. But he turning about, and looking on his disciples rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou savourest not the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had called the people to him, with his disciples also, he said to them, Whosoever is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life, for my sake and the gospels, he shall save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Or what shall a man give, in exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
