And what wisdom is this that is given him, that such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is not this the carpenter? The son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and of Judas and Simon! And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he could do no miracle there, save that he laid his hands on a few sick and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about thro' the villages teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he calleth to him the twelve, and sent them forth by two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And commanded them to take nothing for the journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no mony in their purse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But be shod with sandals, and not to put on two coats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, Wheresoever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you, departing thence shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went out and preached, that men should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And king Herod heard (for his name was spread abroad) and he said, John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore divine powers exert themselves in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said, It is Elijah: and others said, It is a prophet, as one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Herod hearing thereof, said, This is that John whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him in prison, for Herodias sake, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee, to have thy brother's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Herodias was incensed against him, and was desirous to have killed him; but she could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For Herod reverenced John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and preserved him: and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a convenient day being come, when Herod on his birth-day made a feast, for his lords, captains, and principal men of Galilee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the daughter of Herodias had come in and danced and pleased Herod, and his guests, the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he sware to her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask me, I will give thee, to the half my kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And coming in quickly with haste to the king she asked, saying, I will that thou give me immediately in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king was exceeding sorry: yet for his oath's sake, and for the sake of his guests, he would not reject her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately the king sent one of his guard, and commanded his head to be brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went and beheaded him in the prison, And brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the disciples hearing it, came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the apostles gather themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they departed into a desert place by boat privately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And many saw them departing and knew him, and ran a foot thither from all the cities, and outwent them, and came together to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus coming out saw a great multitude, and was moved with tender compassion for them; because they were as sheep having no shepherd, and he taught them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the day was now far spent, the disciples coming to him said, This is a desert place, and it is now late.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He saith to them, How many loaves have you? Go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And taking the five loaves, and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed, and gave them to the disciples to set before them: and he divided the two fishes among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they all ate and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they that had eaten of the loaves, were about five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And straightway he constrained his disciples to go into the boat, and go before to the other side toward Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And having sent them away, he went to a mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And in the evening, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But they seeing him walking on the sea, supposed it had been an apparition, and cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>(For they all saw him and were troubled.) And immediately he talked with them, and saith to them, Take courage: it is I: be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased: and they were amazed in themselves above measure and wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For they considered not the miracle of the loaves; for their heart was hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and drew to shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they were come out of the boat, they knew him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And ran thro' the whole country round about, and brought about in beds them that were ill, where they heard he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wheresoever he entered into villages, cities, or country-places, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the hem of his garment; and as many as touched him were made whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
