He is risen: he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell his disciples, and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And going out, they fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: and they said nothing to any; for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when Jesus was risen early, the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they, hearing that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they were walking, going into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went and told it to the rest, neither believed they them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterwards he appeared to the eleven, sitting at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them who had seen him after he was risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these signs shall follow them that believe: in my name they shall cast out devils:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they shall speak with new tongues: They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them: they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat on the right-hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
