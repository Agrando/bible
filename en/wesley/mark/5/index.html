I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For he had said to him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered saying, My name is Legion; for we are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he earnestly besought him, that he would not send them away out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there was there at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us to the swine, that we may go into them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus forthwith gave them leave. And the unclean spirits going out, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see that which was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come to Jesus and see the demoniac, sitting and clothed and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they saw it told them how it befell that demoniac, and also concerning the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they prayed him to depart out of their coasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as he went into the boat, he that had been possessed with the devils, besought him, that he might be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jesus suffered him not, but said to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he departed and published in Decapolis, how great things Jesus had done for him. And all men marvelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Jesus was passed over again by boat to the other side, much people was gathered to him, and he was near the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, falleth at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed, and she shall live. And he went with him, and much people followed him and thronged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And a certain woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years, And had suffered many things of many physicians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but rather grown worse, Having heard of Jesus, came in the croud behind, and touched his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For she said, If I but touch his clothes, I shall be whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the fountain of her blood was straightway dried up, and she knew in her body, that she was healed of that plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus immediately knowing in himself, that virtue had gone out of him, turning about in the croud said, Who touched my clothes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he looked round to see her that had done this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole: go in peace, and continue whole of thy plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master farther?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When Jesus heard the word spoken he saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; only believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth a tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And coming in, he saith to them, Why make ye this ado and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they laughed him to scorn. But having put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and goeth in where the damsel was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And taking the damsel by the hand he said to her, Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted, Damsel, (I say to thee) arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And straightway the damsel arose and walked: for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he charged them straitly, that no man should know it, and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
