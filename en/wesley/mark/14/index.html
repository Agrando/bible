And they murmured at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said, Let her alone: why trouble ye her? She hath wrought a good work on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For ye have the poor always with you, and when ye will, ye may do them good; but me ye have not always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She hath done what she could: she hath before-hand embalmed my body for the burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Verily I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, what she hath done shall be spoken of also, for a memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And hearing it they were glad, and promised to give him mony. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayst eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the man of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And his disciples went, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them. And they made ready the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. And as they sat and ate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus said, Verily I say to you, one of you that eat with me will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they were sorry, and said to him one by one, Is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another, Is it I? And he answering said to them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him; but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man, if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as they ate, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took the cup, and having given thanks, gave it them, and they all drank of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, This is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Verily I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, till that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having sung the hymn, they went out toward the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus saith to them, Ye all will be offended at me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter said to him, Tho' all men shall be offended, yet will not I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus saith to him, Verily I say to thee, That thou to-day, this night, before the cock crow twice, wilt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he said the more vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. In like manner also said they all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they come to a place named Gethsemane; and he saith to his disciples, Sit here while I shall pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he taketh with him Peter and James and John; and he began to be sore amazed and in deep anguish, And saith to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death; tarry ye here and watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And going forward a little, he fell on the ground, and prayed, that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: take away this cup from me: yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he cometh and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Couldest thou not watch one hour? Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going again he prayed, speaking the same words. And returning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>he found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy) and they knew not what to answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he cometh the third time and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour is come: behold the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Rise up; let us go: lo he that betrayeth me is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately, while ye yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now he that betrayed him had given them a signal, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, is he: seize and lead him away safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, Master!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And kissed him? And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And one of them that stood by, drew a sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus answering said to them, Are ye come as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not; but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then they all forsook him and fled. And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and the young men laid hold on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and with him were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders and scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest, and sat with the officers, and warmed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Then the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus, to put him to death, and found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For many bore false witness against him; but their evidences were not sufficient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And there arose certain, and bore false witness against him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And neither so was their evidence sufficient. Then the high priest standing up in the midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>What is it which these witness against thee? But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man, sitting on the right-hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the high priest rent his clothes and saith, What farther need have we of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to deserve death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy, And the officers smote him with the palms of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as Peter was in the hall below, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And seeing Peter warming himself, she looked on him and said, Thou wast also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou meanest. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And the maid saw him again, and said to them that stood by, This is one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And he denied it again. And a little after, those that stood by, said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. And he covered his head and wept.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
