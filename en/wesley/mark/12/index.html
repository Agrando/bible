He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And have ye not read this scripture? The stone which the builders rejected, is become the head of the corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This was the Lord's doing, and it was marvellous in our eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they sought to seize him, but feared the multitude; for they knew he had spoken the parable against them; and leaving him, they went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they send to him certain of the Pharisees, and of the Herodians, to catch him his talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they coming say to him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me a penny, that I may see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saith, Whose is this image and superscription?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say to him, Cesar's. And Jesus answering said to them, Render to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then come to him the Saducees, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There were seven brethren, and the first took a wife, and dying, left no seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the second took her and died, neither left he any seed; and the third likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the seventh took her and left no seed. Last of all died the woman also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the seven had her to wife. And Jesus answering said to them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels who are in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And touching the dead, that they rise, Have ye oot read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake to thim, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. Ye therefore greatly err.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the scribes came, and having heard them disputing together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>This is the first commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the scribe said to him, Excellently well, Master! Thou hast said the truth: for He is one: and there is no other but he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the mind, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus, seeing that he answered discreetly, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst question him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus answering, as he taught in the temple, said, How say the scribes, that Christ is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord saith to my Lord, Sit thou on my righthand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David therefore himself calleth him Lord: How is he then his son? And a great multitude heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them in his teaching, Beware of the Scribes, who love to go in long sobes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and to be saluted in the market-places, And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts: Who devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>these shall receive the greater damnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus sitting over-against the treasury, beheld how the people cast mony into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And a poor widow coming, cast in two mites, which make a farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And calling his disciples, he saith to them, Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all who have cast into the treasury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For they all did cast in of their abundance: but she of her penury did cast in all that she had, even her whole living.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
