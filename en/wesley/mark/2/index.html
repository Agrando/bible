And they come to him, bringing a paralytic, borne of four.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And not being able to come nigh him for the croud, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having broken it up, they let down the couch whereon the paralytic lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But certain of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who can forgive sins, but God only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus immediately knowing in his spirit, that they so reasoned in themselves, said to them, Why reason ye thus in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier? To say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk? But that ye may know, that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins: (He saith to the paralytic) I say to thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Arise, and take up thy couch, and go to thine house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And immediately he arose, and taking up his couch, went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went forth again by the sea-side, and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And passing by, he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus sitting at the custom-house, and saith to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he arose and followed him. And as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the scribes and Pharisees seeing him eat with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? And Jesus hearing it saith to them-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and then shall they fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No man seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filleth it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no man putteth new wine into old leathern-bottles; else the new wine bursteth the bottles, and the wine is spilt, and the bottles are lost; but new wine must be put into new bottles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went thro' the corn-fields on the sabbath day: and his disciples as they went, plucked the ears of corn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry he and they that were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave also to them who were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Moreover the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
