And the Lord said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him as soon as he cometh from the field, Come and sit down to table?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And will not rather say to him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I think not. So likewise ye, when ye have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are but unprofitable servants: we have done what was our duty to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as he went to Jerusalem, he passed thro' the confines of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten lepers, who stood afar off:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they lifted up their voice and said, Jesus, master, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And seeing them, he said to them, Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and with a loud voice glorified God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But where are the nine? There are not found to give glory to God, save this stranger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Arise and go, thy faith hath saved thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And being asked by the Pharisees, When cometh the kingdom of God, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God, cometh not with observation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they shall say to you, See here; see there: go not, nor follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ior as the lightning that lightneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven, so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even thus shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he that shall be on the house-top and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his life, shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, in this night, there shall be two men in one bed; one shall be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two women shall be grinding together; one shall be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answering said to him, Where Lord? And he said to them, Wheresoever the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
