Then said he to the keeper of the vineyard, Behold three years I come seeking fruit of this fig tree, and find aone: cut it down: why doth it also cumber the ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it and dung it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Perhaps it may bear fruit: but if not, after that thou shalt cut it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together and utterly unable to lift up herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus seeing her, called her to him, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the ruler of the synagogue, being much displeased, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, answered and said, There are six days, in which man ought to work: on these therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each of you loose his ox or ass from the stall on the sabbath, and lead him away to watering!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound lo these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I resemble it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a grain of mustard-seed which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in the branches of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again he said, Whereto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like leaven, which a woman took and covered up in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he went thro' the cities and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that are saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to him, Strive to enter in thro' the strait gate; for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and knock at the door saying, Lord, Lord, open to us: He shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then shall ye say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall come from the east and the west, and the north and the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The same day came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Go out and depart from hence; for Herod is minded to kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow; and the third day I am perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But I must go on to day, and to morrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a bird gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold your house is left to you desolate; and verily I say to you, Ye shall not see me, till the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
