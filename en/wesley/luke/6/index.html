And the scribes and Pharisees watched, whether he would heal on the sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the withered hand, Rise up and stand forth in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he arose and stood forth. Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you, Which is lawful on the sabbath, To do good, or to do evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To save life, or to kill? And looking round upon them all, he said to him, Stretch forth thy hand; and he did so: and his hand was restored as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they were filled with madness, and talked one with another, what they should do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in those days he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in the prayer of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, he called to him his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom also he named Apostles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon (whom also he named Peter) and Andrew his brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes, Jude the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And coming down with them, he stood on a plain, and the croud of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they that were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the whole multitude sought to touch him; for virtue went out of him, and healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And lifting up his eyes on his disciples, he said, Happy are ye poor: for your's is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Happy are ye that hunger now; for ye shall be satisfied: happy are ye that weep now; for ye shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Happy are ye when men shall hate you, and shall separate you from their company, and shall revile you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day and leap for joy; for behold your reward is great in heaven; for in like manner did their fathers to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But wo to you that are rich; for ye have your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wo to you that are full; for ye shall hunger: wo to you that laugh now; for ye shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wo to you, when all men shall speak well of you; for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say to you that hear, Love your enemies; do good to them that hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And to him that smiteth thee on the cheek, offer also the other: and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to every man that asketh thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? For sinners also love those that love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? For even sinners do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? For even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love ye your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the unthankful and the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemed; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete with, it shall be measured to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not above his master, but every one that is perfected, shall be as his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, thou thyself not seeing the beam that is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For there is no good tree which bringeth forth corrupt fruit, neither a corrupt tree, which bringeth forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For every tree is known by its own fruit; for they do not gather figs from thorns, nor from a bramble do they gather grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doth them, I will shew you to whom he is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man, who built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream broke vehemently upon that house, but could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he that heareth, and doth not, is like a man that built an house without a foundation upon the earth: against which the stream broke vehemently, and immediately it fell: and the breach of that house was great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
