And in those days he ate nothing, and when they were ended he hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the devil said to him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the devil taking him up into an high mountain, shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the devil said to him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them; for it is delivered to me, and I give it to whomsoever I will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus answering said to him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the battlement of the temple, and said, If thou be the son of God, cast thyself down from hence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it is written, He shall charge his angels concerning thee, to keep thee: And in their hands they shall bear thee up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the devil, having ended all the temptation, departed from him till a convenient season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of him, thro' all the region round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up; and as his custom was; he went into the synagogue on the sabbath, and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah, and having opened the book,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>To publish the acceptable year of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having closed the book, he gave it again to the servant, and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, This day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Ye will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself. Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, Verily I say to you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I tell you of a truth, Many widows were in Israel, in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, while a great famine was thro' all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet to none of these was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet none of them was healed, but Naaman the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all in the synagogue hearing these things, were filled with fury,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And rising up, thrust him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, to cast him down headlong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he passing thro' the midst of them, went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there was in the synagogue, a man who had a spirit of an unclean devil; and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, Let us alone:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy one of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And the devil having thrown him in the midst, came out of him, and hurt him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What word is this, that with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the same of him went forth into every place of the country round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was ill of a fever, and they besought him for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her: and immediately she arose and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now when the sun was set, all that had any sick of divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And devils also came out of many, crying out and saying, Thou art Christ, the Son of God. And he rebuking them, suffered them not to say, that they knew he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the multitude sought him, and came to him, and detained him, that he might not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also; for therefore am I sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
