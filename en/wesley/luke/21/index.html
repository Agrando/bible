And what is the sign, when these things shall come to pass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ: And the time is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go ye not after them. And when ye shall hear of wars, and commotions, be not terrified; for these things must be first; but the end is not immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said he to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines and pestilences, and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all these things they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to premeditate what to answer.
