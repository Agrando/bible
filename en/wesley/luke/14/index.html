And he took him and healed him and let him go,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they could not answer him again to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he spake a parable to them that were invited, when he marked how they chose the chief seats,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>saying to them, When thou art invited by any man to a marriage-feast, sit not down in the highest place, lest a more honourable man than thou be invited by him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he that invited thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place. And then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place. But when thou art invited,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>go and sit down in the lowest place, that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour in the presence of them that sit at table with thee. For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he also to him that had invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours, lest they also invite thee again, and a recompence be made thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when thou makest an entertainment, invite the poor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>the disabled, the lame, the blind, And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee; but thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them that sat at table with him, hearing these things, said to him, Happy is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a field, I must needs go and see it: I pray thee, have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the disabled, and the lame, and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant said, Sir, it is done as thou hast commanded; and yet there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited, shall taste of my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And great multitudes went with him. And he turned and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And which of you intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and computeth the cost, whether he hath sufficient to finish it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lest haply after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king marching to incounter another king in war, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand, to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an embassage, and desireth conditions of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So every one of you, who forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is neither fit for the land nor yet for dung; they cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
