For I am an old man, and my wife advanced in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, thou shalt be deaf, and not able to speak, till the day that these things are done, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And coming out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived, that he had seen a vision; for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he went to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after these days, his wife Elisabeth conceived,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord done to me, in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, to a city of Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>named Nazareth, To a virgin of the house of David, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, and the virgin's name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the angel coming in to her, said, Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But she seeing him, was troubled at his saying, and reasoned, what manner of salutation this should be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob; for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answering said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born, shall be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And behold thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For with God, nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the hill-country, into a city of Judah ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And cried with a loud voice and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For lo! when the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And happy is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy is on them that fear him, from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He hath wrought strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He hath put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted them of low degree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He hath filled the hungry with good things, but sent the rich empty away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He hath helped his servant Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>in remembrance of his mercy, As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now Elisabeth's full time came, that she should be delivered, and she brought forth a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbours and relations heard, that the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But his mother answering said, Nay, but he shall be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these things were noised abroad, in all the hill-country of Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, in the house of his servant David:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began: That we should be saved from our enemies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>and from the hand of all that hate us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>That he would grant us, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>to serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And thou, child, shalt be a prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>To give knowledge of salvation to his people, by the remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Thro' the tender mercy of our God, whereby the Day-spring from on high hath visited us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the day of his being shewn to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
