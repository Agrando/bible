And the younger of them said to his father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he divided to them his substance. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and took a journey into a far country, and there squandered away his substance, living riotously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields, to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate: and no man gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am no more worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose and came to his father: But while he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and his bowels yearned, and he ran, and fell on his neck and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they began to be merry. Now his elder son was in the field. And as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And calling one of the servants, he asked what these things meant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he told him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him in good health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was angry, and would not go in: therefore his father coming out intreated him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he answering said to his father, Lo these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I thy commandment at any time, yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as soon as this thy son was come, who hath devoured thy substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Son, thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But it was meet to make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
