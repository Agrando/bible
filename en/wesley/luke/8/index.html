And saying these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And his disciples asked him, What is this parable?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others in parables, so that seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those by the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Those on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. But they have no root, who for a while believe; but in time of temptation fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That which fell among thorns are they, who, having heard, go forth, and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But that on the good ground are they, who, having heard the word, keep it in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with perseverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No man having lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For there is nothing hid that shall not be discovered, neither any thing concealed, that shall not be known and come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even what he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came toward him his mother and his brethren, but could not come to him for the croud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it was told him by some who said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he answering said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God and keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And on a certain day he went into a vessel with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put to sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as they sailed, he fell asleep. And there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filled with water, and were in danger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they came and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish! And he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, Where is your faith? But they were afraid and wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this? For he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over-against Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he went forth to land, there met him out of the city, a certain man that had had devils a long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in an house, but in the tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What hast thou to do with me, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, torment me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man: for many times it had caught him, and he had been kept bound with chains and fetters, and breaking the bands asunder, he had been driven by the spirit into the deserts.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; because many devils had entered into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they besought him, that he would not command them to go into the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there was an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him, that he would suffer them to enter into them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he suffered them. Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a steep place into the lake and were choked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they that fed them, seeing what was done, fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They also that had seen it told them, How he that was possessed by the devils was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about, besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear, and he went in the vessel and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the man out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, Return home,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and shew what great things God hath done for thee. And he went and published through the whole city, how great things Jesus had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when Jesus returned, the people gladly received him; for they were all waiting for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And behold there came a man named Jairus, and he was ruler of the synagogue; and falling down at the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went, the people thronged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And a woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years, and had spent all her living upon Physicians, neither could be healed by any,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Came behind him and touched the border of his garment, and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus said, Some one hath touched me; for I know that virtue is gone out of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared to him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she had been healed immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, Daughter, take courage: thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus hearing it answered him, saying, Fear not; believe only, and she shall be made whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And coming into the house, he suffered none to go in, save Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the maiden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all wept and bewailed her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead; but sleepeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he put them all out, and taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maid, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit returned, and she arose straightway, and he commanded to give her meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were astonished: but he charged them, to tell no man that which had been done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
