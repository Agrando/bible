And said to them, Take nothing for your journey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>neither staves, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money: neither have two coats apiece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide and thence depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they departed, and went thro' the towns preaching the Gospel and healing every where.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him. And he was perplexed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>because it was said by some, That John was risen from the dead; and by some that Elijah had appeared; by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Herod said, John have I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the apostles returning told him what they had done. And he took them and went aside privately into the desert of Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the multitudes knew it, they followed him, and he received them and spake to them of the kingdom of God and healed them that had need of healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the day began to decline. And the twelve coming to him said, send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge and find victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said to them, give ye them to eat. And they said, we have no more than five loaves and two fishes, except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down, by fifties in a company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then taking the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they all ate and were satisfied, and there were taken up of fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as he was praying apart, his Disciples were with him. And he asked them saying, whom say the people that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them, but whom say ye, that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter answering said, The Christ of God. But he straitly charged and commanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>to tell this to no man, saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to all, if any man be willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For who|oever will save his life shall gose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, he shall save it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For what is a man profited, if he gain the whble world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's and that of the holy angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I tell you of a truth there are some standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And about eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and James and John, and went up into a mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as he prayed, the fashien of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who appearing in glory, spake of his decease, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep; and awaking they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And just as they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents, ane for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>While he spake thus, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they feared while they entered into the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear ye him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone: and they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the next day, as they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And behold a man from the croud, cried aloud saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is my only child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him, that he foameth, and bruising him, hardly departeth from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as he was yet coming, the devil threw him down and tore him: and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. And while they all wondered at all things which Jesus did,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he said to his disciples, Let these sayings sink down into your ears; for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, so that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of this saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Jesus seeing the thought of their heart, took a little child,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and sat him by him, And said to them, whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And John answering said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him; because he followeth not with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said to him, forbid him not, for he that is not against you is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And when the time was fulfilled, that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But they did not receive him, because his face was, as tho' he would go to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And his disciples James and John seeing it said, Lord, Wilt thou that we bid fire come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he turning rebuked them and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And as they went in the way, one said to him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests: but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And he said to another, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But he said, Lord, Suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but suffer me first to bid them farewell that are in my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus said to him, No man having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
