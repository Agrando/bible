Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. And I say to you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he that denieth me before man, shall be denied before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they bring you to the synagogues and to magistrates and powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>take no thought how or what ye shall answer or what ye shall say. For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that hour, what ye ought to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one out of the croud said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, Take heed and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he spake a parable to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully. And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I have no room where to stow my fruits. And he said, This I will do: I will pull down my barns and build greater; and there will I stow all my fruits and my goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years: take thine ease; eat, drink, and be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: and whose shall the things be that thou hast provided?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life what ye shall eat, neither for the body what ye shall put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The life is more than meat, and the body than raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens; for they neither sow nor reap; neither have store-house nor barn: yet God feedeth them. How much better are ye than the birds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you by taking thought, can add the least measure to his age?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If ye then be not able to do that which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If then God so cloth the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the still, how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And seek not ye, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of a doubtful mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the nations of the world seek all these things; and your Father knoweth that ye need these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell what ye have and give alms: provide yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your loins be girt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and your lamps burning, And be like men that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the wedding, that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Happy are those servants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, shall find watching; verily I say to you, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down to table, and will come forth and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, happy are those servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this ye know, that if the master of the house had known, what hour the thief would have come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broke open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore be ye also ready; for the Son of man cometh in an hour when ye think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Peter said to him, Lord, speakest thou this parable to us, or also to all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, Who is that faithful and wise steward, whom his Lord shall make ruler over his housoold, to give the allowance of food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Happy is that servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Verily I say to you, he will set him over all that he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that servant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to beat the men servants and maidens, and to eat, and drink, and be drunken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he expecteth not, and at an hour when he knoweth not, and will cut him in sunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that servant who knew his Lord's will, and prepared not, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For to whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required; and to whom they have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I am come to send fire on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And what do I desire? That it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to be baptized with: and how am I straitned till it be accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Suppose ye that I am come to send peace upon earth? I tell you, Nay, but rather division.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he said to the people also, When ye see a cloud rising out of the west, straitway ye say, There cometh a heavy shower, and so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when ye find the south wind blowing, ye say, There will be sultry heat; and it is so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the earth and of the sky: how do ye not discern this season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>When thou art going with thine adversary to the magistrate, give diligence in the way to be delivered from him: lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell thee, thou shalt in no wise come out thence, till thou hast paid the last mite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
