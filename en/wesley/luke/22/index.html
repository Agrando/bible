And they made ready the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, With desire have I desired to eat this passover with you, before I suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I say to you, I will not eat thereof any more, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he took the cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he took bread, and gave thanks and brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And truly the Son of man goeth as it was determined; but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they inquired among themselves, Which of them it was, that would do this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There was also a contention among them, Which of them was greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and they that exercise authority upon them have the title of benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief as he that serveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye are they who have continued with in me in my temptations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not: and when thou art returned, strengthen thy brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, it shall not be the time of cockcrowing this day, before thou wilt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they said, Nothing. Then said he to them, But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip; and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say to you, That this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For the things concerning me have an end. And they said, Behold here are two swords. And he said to them, it is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and kneeling down, he prayed, saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And rising up from prayer, he came to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and found them sleeping for sorrow, And said to them, Why sleep ye? Rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When they who were about him saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answering said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, who were come to him, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then took they him, and led him, and brought him to the high-priest's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sat down together, Peter sat down among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But a certain maid seeing him as he sat by the light, and looking earnestly upon him, said, This man also was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a while another saw him and said, Thou art also of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And Peter said, Man, I am not. And about one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou meanest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turning looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>how he had said to him, Before cock-crowing, thou wilt deny me thrice. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men that held Jesus mocked and smote him. And having blindfolded him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And when it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>and led him into their council, Saying, Art thou the Christ? Tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right-hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He said, Ye say it: I am. And they said, What farther need have we of witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
