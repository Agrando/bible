Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? For my lord taketh away the stewardship from me. I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what to do, that when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So having called to him every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, An hundred measures of oil. He said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? He said, An hundred measures of wheat. He saith, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely; for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that is faithful in the least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will intrust you with the true riches?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if ye have not been fauthful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or he will cleave to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard these things, and they derided him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men: but God knoweth your hearts: And that which is highly esteemed among men, is an abomination before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the Prophets were until John: from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man forceth into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than for one tittle of the law to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted splendidly every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table: yea, the dogs also came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the beggar died and was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died and was buried:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in hell lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said, Son, remember, that thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And besides all this, between us and you, there is a great gulph fixed; so that they who would pass from us to you, cannot, neither can they pass to us that would come from thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said, I pray thee, therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I have five brethren; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded tho' one rose from the dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
