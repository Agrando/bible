And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus hearing these things, marvelled at him, and turning, said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they that had been sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he went afterward to a city called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him and a great multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he drew nigh the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude of the city was with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Lord seeing her, was moved with tender compassion for her, and said, Weep not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he came and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the dead man sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fear seized all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God hath visited his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this rumour of him went forth through all Judea, and all the country round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John informed him of all these things. And John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>calling to him two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men being come to him, said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues, and of evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he answering said to them, Go and tell John the things ye have seen and heard: the blind see; the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed; the deaf hear; the dead are raised; to the poor the gospel is preached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And happy is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the messengers of John were departed, he said to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>A reed shaken by the wind? But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that are splendidly apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I say to you, among those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Pharisees and scribes made void the counsel of God, toward themselves, being not baptized of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>To whom then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of man is come, eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But wisdom is justified by all her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, he sat down to table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And behold a woman in the city, who had been a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee's house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>brought an alabaster box of ointment, And standing at his feet behind him weeping, watered his feet with a shower of tears, and wiped them, with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known, who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But they having nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both: Which therefore will love him most?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answering said, I suppose, he to whom he forgave most. He said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath watered my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Thou didst not anoint my head with oil: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Wherefore I say to thee, Those many sins of her's are forgiven; therefore she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they that sat at table with him said within themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
