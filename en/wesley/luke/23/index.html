Then said Pilate to the chief priests and the multitude, I find no fault in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they were the more violent saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pilate hearing of Galilee asked, If the man was a Galilean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he knew, that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also in Jerusalem at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Herod seeing Jesus was exceeding glad; for he had been long desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he questioned him in many words, but he answered him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Herod, having with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a splendid robe, sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the people, Said to them, Ye have brought this man to me, as perverting the people; and behold, I having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man, touching the things whereof ye accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor yet Herod; for I sent you to him; and lo, he hath done nothing worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will therefore chastise and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was under a necessity of releasing one to them at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they cried all at once saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(Who for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder had been cast into prison.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pilate desiring to release Jesus, spake again to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him. He said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they insisted with loud voices, requiring that he should be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate gave sentence, that what they desired should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released to them him, that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they led him away, they laid hold on one Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there followed him a great company of people and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For behold the days are coming in which they will say, Happy are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps that never gave suck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then shall they say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there were also led two other men, malefactors, to be put to death with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they were come to the place, called the place of a scull, there they crucified him, and the two malefactors, one on the right-hand, and one on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment and cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others: let him save himself, if he be the Christ, the chosen of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a superscription also was written over him in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one of the malefactors, who were hanging on the cross, reviled him, saying, If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this person hath done nothing amiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me, when thou comest in thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it was about the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth till the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And having said thus, he expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And the centurion seeing what was done, glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the people who had come together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, returned, smiting their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And behold there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor, a good man and a just:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(He had not consented to the counsel and deed of them) of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man going to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And taking it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the women who had come with him from Galilee, following after, beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And returning they prepared spices and ointments, and rested the sabbath, according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
