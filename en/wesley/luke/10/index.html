In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things are delivered to me of my Father; and no one knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you, many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And behold, a certain scribe stood up, and trying him, said, Master, what shall I do, to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to him, What is written in the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to him, Thou hast answered right: this do and thou shalt live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who having stripped and wounded him departed, leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass that a certain priest came down that way, and seeing him, passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain Samaritan journeying, came where he was, and seeing him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>was moved with tender compassion, And going to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and setting him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on the morrow departing, he took out two pieces of money, and gave them to the host, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, as I come back I will repay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was the neighbour to him that fell among the robbers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go and do thou likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And as they went, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And she had a sister called Mary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who also sitting at the feet of Jesus, heard his discourse. But Martha was incumbered with much serving; and coming to him she said, Lord, dost thou not care, that my sister hath left me to serve alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Bid her therefore help me. But Jesus answering said to her, Martha, Martha! Thou art careful and hurried about many things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
