Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the strength of Christ may rest upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am become a fool in boasting; but ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing have I fallen short of the very chief apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For wherein were ye inferior to the other churches, unless that I myself was not burdensom to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Forgive me this wrong. Behold the third time I am ready to come to you: yet I will not be burdensom to you; for I seek not yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will most gladly spend, and be spent for your souls, though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be it so: I did not burden you: but being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? In the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Think ye that we again excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ, and all things, beloved, for your edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear lest when I come, I should not find you such as I would, and lest I should be found by you such as ye would not: lest there should be contentions, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults, Lest my God should humble me when I come to you again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I should mourn over many of them who had sinned before, and have not repented of the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
