God knoweth. But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off the occasion from them who desire occasion, that wherein they boast, they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it is no great thing, if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose ends shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; but if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I also may boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I speak, I speak not after the Lord; but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For ye, being wise, suffer fools willingly. For ye suffer, if a man inslave you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>if he devour you, if he take from you, if he exalt himself, if he smite you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak with regard to reproach, as though we had been weak: whereas in whatever any is confident, (I speak as a fool) I am confident also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak foolishly) I more: in labours more abundantly, in stripes more exceedingly, in prisons more abundantly, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Five times I received from the Jews forty stripes save one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I have been shipwrecked, a day and a night I passed in the deep: In journeyings often,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from the heathen; in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brethren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In labour and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Beside the things which are from without, that which rusheth upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Since I must glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor under king Aretas, kept the city of the Damascenes with a guard, being determined to apprehend me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But I was let down through a window in a basket by the wall, and escaped from his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
