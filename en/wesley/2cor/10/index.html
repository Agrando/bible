If any man be confident, that he is Christ's, let him again think this of himself, that as he is Christ's, so we also are Christ's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, if I should boast something more also of the authority which the Lord hath given us, for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That I may not seem to terrify you by letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For his letters indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such an one think this, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, such are we also in deed, when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we presume not to equal or to compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves: but they among themselves limiting themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not boastingly extend ourselves beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the providence, which God hath allotted us, a measure to reach even unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we do not extend ourselves excessively, as not reaching to you; for we are come even to you, in the gospel of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Not boastingly extending ourselves beyond our measure, in the labours of others; but having hope, now your faith is increased, to be inlarged by you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>yet still within our province, abundantly, So as to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, not to boast in another's province of things made ready to our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
