They count it pleasure to riot in the day time; spots and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings, while they feast with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Having eyes full of adultery, and that cease not from sin; beguiling unstable souls, having hearts exercised with covetousness, accursed children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who have forsaken the right way and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Boser, who loved the reward of unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he had a rebuke for his iniquity: the dumb ass, speaking with man's voice, forbad the madness of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are wells without water, clouds driven by a tempest, to whom the blackness of darkness is reserved for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For by speaking swelling words of vanity, they allure thro' the desire of the flesh, thro' wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them that live in error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While they promise them liberty, themselves are the slaves of corruption; for by whom a man is overcome, by him he is also brought into slavery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, thro the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again intangled therein and overcome, their last state is worse then the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it had been better for them, not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But it has befallen them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
