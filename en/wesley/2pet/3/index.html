For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this they are willingly ignorant of, that by the word of God of old the heavens were and the earth, standing out of the water and in the water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thro' which the world that then was, being overflowed with water perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the heavens and the earth that are now, are by his word kept in store reserved unto fire, against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, beloved, be not ye ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord is not slow concerning his promise (tho' some men count it slowness) but is long-suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Seeing then all these things are dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Looking for and hastning the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless we look for new heavens and a new earth, according to his promise, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore, beloved, seeing ye look for these things, labour to be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And account the long-suffering of our Lord salvation, as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given him , hath written to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As also in all his epistles, speaking therein of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye, therefore, beloved, knowing these things before, beware, lest ye also being led away by the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity!
