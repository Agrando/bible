Jesus saith to them, My time is not yet come: your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go ye up to the feast; I go not up to this feast yet; because my time is not yet fully come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Having said these things to them, he abode in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were privately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him: for some said, He is a good man; others said, Nay; but he seduceth the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, no man spake openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now at the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How doth this man know letters, having never learned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man be willing to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory; but he that seekth the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet none of you keepeth the law. Why seek ye to kill me? The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil. Who seeketh to kill thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses gave you circumcision, (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers) and ye circumcise a man on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken: Are ye angry at me, because I intirely healed a man on the sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And lo he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed, that this is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Howbeit, we know this man, whence he is: but when Christ cometh, none knoweth whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Do ye both know me, and know whence I am? And yet I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to seize him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the people whispering such things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time I am with you, and then I go to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye shall seek, and shall not find me, and where I am, ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me? And where I am, ye cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believeth on me, out of his belly (as the scripture hath said) shall flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>This he spake of the Spirit, which they who believed on him were to receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Many of the people therefore hearing this discourse, said, Certainly this is the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But some said, Doth Christ come out of Galilee? Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division among the people concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them would have seized him; but no man laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees answered, Are ye also deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this populace, who know not the law, are accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus (he that had come to Jesus by night, being one of them) saith to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Doth our law judge a man before it hear him, and know what he doth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, Art thou also a Galilean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Search and see, that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. And every man went to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
