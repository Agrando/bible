Behold the world is gone after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now among those who came up to worship at the feast, there were certain Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew; and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, Unless a grain of wheat that falleth into the ground die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall preserve it to life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But for this cause I came, for this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then a voice came from heaven, I have both glorified, and I will glorify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The multitude who stood and heard it, said, It thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>(He spake this, signifying what death he should die.) The people answered him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>We have heard out of the law, that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who is this Son of man? Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness overtake you, for he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become children of light. These things spake Jesus, and retiring concealed himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But tho' he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So that the word of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled which he said, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they could not believe, according to what Isaiah said again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they might not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted, that I might heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed on him, but they did not confess him, because of the Pharisees, lest they should be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jesus said with a loud voice, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, may not continue in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken of myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should say, and how I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting; what therefore I speak to you, as the Father hath said to me, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
