(Now there was much grass in the place) So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sat down, and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were filled, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They therefore gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then those men, having seen the miracle which Jesus did, said, Of a truth this is the prophet that was to come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus therefore knowing, that they were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, again retired to the mountain all alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the evening, his disciples went down to the sea, And entering into the vessel, they went over the sea toward Capernaum:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sea ran high, a great wind blowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh to the ship: and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they willingly received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The day following, the multitude who had stood on the other side of the sea, because they saw there was no other vessel there, save that one into which his disciples went, and that Jesus went not into the vessel with his disciples, but that his disciples were gone away alone:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(But there came other little vessels from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>after the Lord had given thanks) When they saw, that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also went aboard the vessels, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them and said, Verily I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you; for him hath God the Father sealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They said therefore to him, What sign dost thou then, that we may see and believe thee? What dost thou work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers ate manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then said Jesus to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, Moses gave you not the bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said they to him, Lord, ever give us this bread. And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I told you, that tho' ye have seen me, ye believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that the Father giveth me, will come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this is the will of him that sent me, That of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews then murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then saith he, I came down from heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No man can come to me, unless the Father who hath sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he who is from God; he hath seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and yet died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>I am the living bread which came down from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews then debated among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But Jesus said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he that eateth of this bread, shall live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>These things he said in the synagogue, teaching at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many of his disciples hearing it, said, This is an hard saying: who can hear it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured about this, said to them, Doth this offend you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken, they are spirit and they are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you who believe not. (For Jesus had known from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who would betray him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Therefore said I to you, That no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From this time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then said Jesus to the twelve, Are ye also minded to go away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Then Simon Peter answered him, saying, Lord, to whom shall we go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we have believed and known, that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He spake of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he it was that would betray him, being one of the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
