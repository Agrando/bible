Pilate saith to them, Take ye him and crucify him; for I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilate heard that saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>he was the more afraid, And returned into the palace and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Jesus gave him no answer. Then Pilate saith to him, Speakest thou not to me? Knowest thou not, that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power over me, unless it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not a friend to Cesar. Whosoever maketh himself a king, opposeth Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate hearing this saying, brought Jesus forth, and sat on the judgment seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(It was then the preparation of the passover, and about the third hour:) And saith to the Jews, Behold your king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried out, Away with him, away with him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then delivered he him to them, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they took Jesus and led him away. And he bearing his cross, went forth to the place, called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Where they crucified him, and two others with him, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate wrote an inscription also, and put it on the cross: and the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of the Jews read this inscription; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said the chief priests to Pilate, Write not, the king of the Jews; but that he said, I am the king of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his vesture: now the vesture was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They said therefore one to another, Let us not rent it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and cast lots for my vesture. These things therefore the soldiers did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus knowing, that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar. And filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a stalk of hyssop, they put it to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and bowing the head, he gave up the Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now because it was the preparation, lest the bodies should remain upon the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a great day) the Jews besought Pilate, that their legs might be broken, and they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But coming to Jesus, when they saw he was dead already, they brake not his legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and forthwith there came out blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he that saw, hath testified it, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of it shall not be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews) asked Pilate leave, to take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Nicodemus also came (who at first had come to Jesus by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which no man had ever been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There therefore they laid Jesus, because of the preparation -day of the Jews; for the sepulchre was nigh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
