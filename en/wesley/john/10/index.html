I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This commission have I received of my Father. There was again a division among the Jews, because of these sayings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear ye him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not the words of one that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the feast of the dedication came on at Jerusalem: and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's portico.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, How long dost thou keep us in suspense?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered them, I have told you; yet ye do not believe: the works that I do in my Father's name, they testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, as I have told you, ye do not believe, because ye are not of my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who gave them me, is greater than all; and none shall pluck them out of my Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews again took up stones to stone him. Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for which of those works do ye stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, We stone thee not for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he call them gods, to whom the word of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>God came (and the scripture cannot be broken) Say ye of him whom God hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do, tho' ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they sought again to seize him; but he escaped out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he went away again beyond Jordan, to the place where John baptized at first, and there he abode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to him and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed on him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
