Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth it, that it may bear more fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now ye are pure thro' the word which I have spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can ye, unless ye abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him, he beareth much fruit; but, separate from me, ye can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If any one abide not in me, he is cast out as a branch, and is withered: and they gather and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hereby is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit: so shall ye be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Abide ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have spoken these things to you, that my joy might remain in you, and your joy might be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one hath greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. I no longer call you servants,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you that ye may go and bear fruit, and your fruit may remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This I command you, that ye love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hate you, ye know it hated me, before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all these things will they do to you, for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that hateth me, hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which no other did, they had not had sin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but now have they seen them, and yet hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So that the word which is written in their law is fulfilled, They hated me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ye also testify, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
