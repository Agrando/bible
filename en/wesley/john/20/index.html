And as she wept,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>she stooped down into the sepulchre, And seeth two angels in white sitting, where the body of Jesus had laid, one at the head, and one at the feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And having said this, she turned herself back, and seeth Jesus standing, but knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She supposing him to be the gardiner, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus saith to her, Mary!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She turning, saith to him, Rabboni; that is, Master. Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The same day, the first day of the week, at evening, the doors being shut, where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace be unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you. As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see the print of the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the prints of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: happy are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus wrought many other miracles also, in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life thro' his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
