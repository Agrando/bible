His mother saith to the servants, Whatsoever he saith to you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there were set there six water-pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus saith to them, Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he saith to them, Draw out now, and carry to the governor of the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they carried it. When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine (he knew not whence it was, but the servants, who had drawn the water knew) the governor of the feast calleth the bridegroom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And saith to him, Every man doth set out good wine first, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus wrought this beginning of miracles in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they tarried there not many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, And found in the temple them that fold oxen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having made a scourge of rushes, he drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and otherthrew the tables, And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of traffick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign shewest thou us, seeing thou dost these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he spake of the temple of his body. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, on the feast day, many believed in his name, beholding the miracles which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jesus did not trust himself to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>because he knew all men, And needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
