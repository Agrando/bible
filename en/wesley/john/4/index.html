Then cometh he to a city of Samaria,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with the journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For his disciples were gone to the city to buy meat.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then saith the woman of Samaria to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank thereof, and his children, and his cattle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered and said to her, Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, will never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, will be in him a fountain of water, springing up into everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: in this thou saidst truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshiped in this mountain: but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus saith to her, Woman, Believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship; for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such worshipers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is a spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman saith to him, I know that the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus saith to her, I that speak to thee, am He.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with a woman. Yet none said, What seekest thou? Or, Why talkest thou with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman then left her water-pot, and went to the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I did:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is not this the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the mean time his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he said to them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. The disciples said one to another, Hath any man brought him to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus saith to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>My meat is, to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Say ye not, There are yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and survey the fields, for they are white already to harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal, that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have sent you to reap that whereon ye have bestowed no labour: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And many of the Samaritans out of that city believed on him, for the saying of the woman testifying, He told me all that ever I did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans were come to him, they besought him to tarry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he abode there two days. And many more believed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>because of his word, And said to the woman, We no longer believe, because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After the two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>(Now Jesus himself had testified, That a prophet hath not honour in his own country.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast. For they also had come to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him, to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down, ere my child die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus saith to him, Go: thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus spake to him, and he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then he asked of them the hour when he amended. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father knew, it was at the same hour, in which Jesus had said to him, Thy son liveth. And himself believed, and his whole house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This second miracle again Jesus wrought, being come out of Judea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
