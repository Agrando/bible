This they spoke tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as they continued asking him, he raised himself and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then stooping down again, he wrote an the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they who heard it, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus raising himself up, and seeing none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She saith, No man, Sir. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then spake Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Tho' I testify of myself, yet my testimony is valid: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but ye know not whence I came, or whither I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye judge after the flesh: I judge no man. And yet if I judge, my judgment is valid; for I am not alone:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but I and the Father that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even in your law it is written, The testimony of two men is valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am one that testify of myself, and the Father that sent me, testifieth of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. And no man seized him; for his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jesus again to them, I go, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whither I go, ye cannot come. The Jews said therefore, Will he kill himself? Because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I said, Ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not, that I am, ye shall die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even what I say to you from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true, and I speak to the world the things which I have heard from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They understood not, that he spake to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore saith to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then said Jesus to the Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never inslaved to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily I say unto you, he that practiseth sin, is the slave of sin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the slave abideth not in the house for ever; but the Son abideth ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye will be free indeed. I know that ye are Abraham's offspring:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak that which I have seen with my father, and ye do that which ye have heard from your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now ye seek to kill me, a man who hath told you the truth which I have heard from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Abraham did not thus. Ye do the deeds of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, If God were your father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth, and come from God. I am come not of myself, but He hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do ye not understand my discourse? Even because ye cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Ye are of your father the devil, and your will is, to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth; for there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But because I speak the truth, ye believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He that is of God, heareth God's words; ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then answered the Jews and said to him, Say we not well, That thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeketh it and judgeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead and the prophets; yet thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? The prophets also are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Whom makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, He is our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Yet ye have not known him: but I know him. And if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you; but I know him, and keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham longed to see my day; and he saw it and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then said the Jews to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then took they up stones to cast at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple, going thro' the midst of them, and so passed on.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
