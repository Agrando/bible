He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not into condemnation, but is passed from death to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son also to have life in himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And hath given him authority, to execute judgment likewise, because he is the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Marvel not at this: for the time is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And shall come forth, they that have done good, to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just: because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I testify of myself, my testimony is not valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another that testifieth of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifieth of me is valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ye sent to John, and he bare testimony to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I receive not testimony from man; but these things I say, that ye may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to fulfil, the very works which I do, testify of me, that the Father hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father who hath sent me, he hath testified of me: ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, ye believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Search the scriptures: in them ye think ye have eternal life: and it is they that testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Yet ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I receive not honour from men, But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can ye believe, while ye receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that is from God only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you even Moses, in whom ye trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
