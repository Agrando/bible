Having said this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he spit on the ground, and made clay with the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And said to him, Go wash at the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the neighbours and they who had seen him before, when he was blind, said, Is not this he who used to sit begging?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, This is he: others, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said to him, How were thine eyes opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I went, and washed, and received sight. Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They bring to the Pharisees the man who had aforetime been blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(It was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Again the Pharisees also asked him, How he had received his sight? He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner, do such miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was a division among them. They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, for that he hath opened thine eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, He is a prophet. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, till they had called the parents of him who had received his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>How then doth he now see? His parents answered them, and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But how he now seeth, we know not, or who hath opened his eyes, we know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He is of age: ask him; he will speak concerning himself. His parents said this, because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed, That if any man should own him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore they called a second time the man that had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said, That he is a sinner I know not: one thing I know, that I was blind, and now see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said to him again, What did he to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How opened he thine eyes? He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hearken: why would ye hear it again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Are ye also willing to be his disciples? Then they reviled him and said, Thou art a disciple of that fellow; but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spake to Moses; but we know not this fellow, whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered and said to them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not whence he is; altho' he hath opened my eyes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God heareth not sinners; but if a man be a worshiper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Since the world began it was not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said to him, Thou-wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and having found him, he said to him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered and said, Sir, who is he, that I may believe on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that talketh with thee is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, Lord, I believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he worshiped him. Jesus said, For judgment am I come into the world, that they who see not, may see, and that they who see, may become blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And some of the Pharisees that were with him heard this, and said to him, Are we blind also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, If ye had been blind, ye would have had no sin. But now ye say, We see: therefore your sin remaineth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
