They will put you out of the synagogues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think he doth God service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>These things will they do, because they have not known the Father nor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I have told you these things, that when the time shall come, ye may remember I told you them. I did not tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have told you this, sorrow hath filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go: for if I go not, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he coming will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Of sin, because they believe not on me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say to you; but ye cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak of himself: but whatsoever he shall hear, he will speak; and he will shew you things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me; for he will take of mine, and shew it you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things that the Father hath, are mine: therefore I said, He will take of mine, and shew it you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then some of his disciples said to each other, What is this that he said to us? A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me? and, Because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore, What is this little while that he speaketh of? We understand not what he saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus knew they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Ye inquire among you of this, that I said, A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, Ye will weep and lament; but the world will rejoice: ye will be sorrowful; but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman when she is in travel, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembreth the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye now therefore have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day ye shall not question me about any thing. Verily, verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask (and ye shall receive) that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have spoken these things to you in parables: but the time is coming, when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but will shew you plainly of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed, that I came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples say to him, Lo now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we are sure thou knowest all things, and needest not that any should question thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered, Ye do now believe. But lo the hour is coming,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>yea, is already come, that ye shall be scattered every one to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone; for the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have spoken these things to you, that ye may have peace in me. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but take courage: I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
