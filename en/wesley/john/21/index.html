They say to him, We also go with thee. They went out and entered into the vessel, but caught nothing that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any meat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They answered him, No. And he said to them, Cast your net on the right side of the vessel, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter hearing that it was the Lord, girt on his upper coat (for he was stript) and threw himself into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the other disciples came in the vessel (for they were not far from land, about two hundred cubits) drawing the net, full of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they came ashore, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have taken now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went on board, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three; and tho' there were so many, the net was not broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus saith to them, Come ye and dine. And none of the disciples presumed to ask him, Who art thou? Knowing that it was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus then cometh and taketh bread, and giveth to them, and fish likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This was the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me more than these do? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He saith to him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again, the second time, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep. He saith to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verily, verily I say unto thee, when thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself, and walk whither thou wouldest: but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And having said this, he saith to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, what shall this man do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus saith to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is it to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Follow thou me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, That he should not die: but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is it to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple, who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true. And there are also many other things which Jesus did,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>which, if they were to be written particularly, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that were written.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
