Jesus saith to them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As soon as he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He asked them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered, I have told you, I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That the saying might be fulfilled which he had spoke, Of them whom thou hast given me, I have lost none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right-ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up the sword into its scabbard. The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the soldiers, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And led him away to Annas first (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Caiaphas was he who had counselled the Jews, that it was expedient one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple. That disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter stood at the door without: therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spake to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then saith the maid, who kept the door, to Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He saith, I am not. And the servants and officers, having made a fire of coals (for it was cold) stood and warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them and warmed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the high priest asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I was continually teaching in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort, and in secret have I said nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why askest thou me? Ask them that heard me, what I said to them: behold, they know what I said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he had said thus, one of the officers, who stood by, gave Jesus a blow, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the servants of the high priest (being kinsman to him whose ear Peter had cut off) saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter denied again, and immediately the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's palace, and it was early: and they went not into the palace themselves, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the saying of Jesus was fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Pilate returned into the palace, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this of thyself? or did others tell it thee of me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, even the chief priests, have delivered thee to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What hast thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I might not be delivered to the Jews: but my kingdom is not from hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate said to him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest. I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice. Pilate saith to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release to you the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
