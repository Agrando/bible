The same came for a testimony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to testify of the light, that all thro' it might believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was not the light, but was sent to testify of the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This was the true light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He was in the world, and the world was made by him; yet the world knew him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But as many as received him, to them gave he privilege to become the sons of God, to them that believe in his name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who were born, not of blood, nor by the will of the flesh, nor by the will of man, but of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Word was made flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>John testified of him and cried, saying, This is he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And out of his fulness have we all received, even grace upon grace. For the law was given by Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but grace and truth was by Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, What then, Art thou Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they to him, Who art thou? That we may give an answer to them that sent us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they who were sent were of the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day he seeth Jesus coming toward him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is preferred before me; for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I knew him not, but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John testified, saying, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove, and it abode upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water, he had said to me, On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, this is he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I saw it, and testified, that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again, the next day, John was standing, and two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And looking upon Jesus walking, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. And Jesus turning and seeing them following,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (that is, being interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John speak and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted the Christ.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The day following he was minded to depart into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip findeth Nathanael and saith to him, We have found him, whom Moses in the law and the prophets described, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael saith to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathagael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Verily, verily I say to you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
