Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind bloweth where it lifteth, and thou hearest the found thereof, but canst not tell, whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily, verily I say to thee, we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; yet ye receive not our testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how would ye believe, if I told you heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For no one hath gone up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so must the Son of man be lifted up, That whosoever believeth on him, may not perish, but have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him, may not perish, but have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God sent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved thro' him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he that practiseth the truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and there he tarried with them and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And John also was baptizing in Enon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John was not yet cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then there arose a dispute between some of John's disciples and the Jews, about purifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must increase, but I must decrease. He that cometh from above is above all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: yet no man receiveth his testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal, that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God; for God giveth not him the Spirit by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: but he that obeyeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
