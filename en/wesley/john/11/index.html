So after he had heard that he was sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he abode still two days in the place where he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then after this he saith to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The disciples say to him, Master, the Jews but now sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if any man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus he spake, and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go to awake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the disciples said, Lord, if he sleep, he will recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus spake of his death, but they thought he had spoken of the natural rest in sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sake I was not there, that ye may believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but let us go to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus came, he found he had been now four days in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him; but Mary sat in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I know even now, that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, tho' he die, yet shall he live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall not die for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Believest thou this? She saith to him, Yea, Lord, I believe thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Having said this, she went and privately called Mary her sister, saying, The master is come, and calleth for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as she heard it, she arose quickly and came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was at the place where Martha had met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews then who were with her in the house and comforted her, seeing Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb, to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned deeply,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and troubled himself, And said, Where have ye laid him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They say to him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said the Jews, Behold, how he loved him! And some of them said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Could not this person, who opened the eyes of the blind, have even caused that this man should not have died?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus again groaning in himself, cometh to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith to him, Lord, by this time he stinketh; for he hath been buried four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they took away the stone from where the dead lay. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Father, I thank thee, that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but I spake this, because of the people who stand by, that they may believe thou hast sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having spoken thus, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapt about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many therefore of the Jews who were come to Mary, and had seen the things, which Jesus had done, believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the chief priests and elders assembled a council and said, What do we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For this man doth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come and subvert both our place and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest that year,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>said to them, Ye know nothing, Nor consider, it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He spake not this of himself, but being high-priest that year, he prophesied, that Jesus should die for the nation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And not for that nation only, but that he might also gather into one all the children of God that were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Therefore from that day, they consulted together to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence into the country, near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the passover of the Jews was nigh; and many went up to Jerusalem, to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then sought they for Jesus, and said one to another, What think ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>That he will not come to the feast? Now both the chief priests and Pharisees had given order, That if any man knew where he was, he should shew it, that they might apprehend him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
