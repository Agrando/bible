Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus saith to him, He who hath been bathed, needeth only to wash his feet, and is clean all over: and ye are clean; but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew who would betray him: therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So after he had washed their feet, he took his garments, and sitting down again, said to them, Know ye what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that ye also may do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If ye know these things, happy are ye, if ye do them. I speak not of you all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I know whom I have chosen, that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I tell you before it is done, that, when it is done, ye may believe that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus having said this, was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily I say unto you, one of you will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was lying in the bosom of Jesus, one of the disciples whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, to ask who it was of whom he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He then, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the sop when I have dipped it. And having dipped the sop, he giveth it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the sop, then Satan entered into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said Jesus to him, What thou dost, do quickly. Now none at the table knew, why he said this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But some thought, as Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need of against the feast, or, Give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He then having received the sop, went out immediately. And it was night, when he went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God be glorified by him, God will also glorify him with himself, and will shortly glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you: ye shall seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Whither I go ye cannot come, so now I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily I say to thee, the cock shall not have crowed, till thou hast denied me thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
