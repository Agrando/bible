He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the testimony which he hath testified of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony, that God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any one see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, let him ask, and he will give him life for them that sin not unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for that. All unrighteousness is sin: but there is a sin not unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but he that is born of God keepeth himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not. We know, that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But we know that the Son of God is come; and he hath given us an understanding that we may know the true one; and we are in the true one, even in his Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God and eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved children, keep yourselves from idols.
