But if any one sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous, And he is the propitiation for our sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He that faith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But whoso keepeth his word, verily in him the love of God is perfected: hereby we know that we are in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that saith, he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but the old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, I do write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you: for the darkness is past away, and the true light now shineth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He that saith, he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because darkness hath blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have written to you, beloved children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written to you young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world: if any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the world passeth away, and the desire thereof; but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that Antichrist cometh, so even now there are many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But ye have an anointing from the Holy one, and know all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not written to you, because ye know not the truth; but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is that liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist who denieth the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whosoever denieth the Son, he hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son, hath the Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning: if that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the promise which he hath promised us, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>These things have I written to you, concerning them that seduce you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any should teach you, save as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie; and as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, beloved children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If ye know, that he is righteous, ye know that every one who doth righteousness is born of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
