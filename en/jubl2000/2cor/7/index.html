In all [things] ye have shown yourselves to be clean in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that, though I wrote unto you, [I did it] not [only] for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort; yea, and we rejoiced even more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I have gloried of anything to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our glorying, which [I made] before Titus, was found true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his inward affection is more abundant toward you while he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all [things].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
