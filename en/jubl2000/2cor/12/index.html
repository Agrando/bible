Most gladly, therefore, I will rather glory in my weaknesses that the power of Christ may dwell in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I am content in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have been a fool, glorying; ye have compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you, for in nothing am I behind the grandiose apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is it in which ye were inferior to the other churches except in that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you, for I seek not your things, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will very gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be it so, I did not burden you; nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I make a gain of you by any of those whom I sent unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I besought Titus and with [him] I sent a brother. Did Titus defraud you? Did we not walk in the same Spirit and in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, do ye think that we excuse ourselves unto you? We speak before God in Christ, but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I desire and [that] I shall be found unto you such as ye desire not, lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, rumours, tumults,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I would have to mourn over many who have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
