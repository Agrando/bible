God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, I will continue to do that I may take away the occasion from those who desire it to be found like unto us in that in which they glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For these false apostles are deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it is no marvel, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, Let no one think me a fool if otherwise, receive me as a fool, that I may yet glory a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That which I speak, I speak [it] not according to the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye [yourselves] are wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye suffer it if anyone brings you into bondage, if anyone devours [you], if anyone takes [of you], if anyone exalts himself, if anyone smites you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak as concerning the reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit in that in which another is bold, (I speak foolishly), I am bold also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? so [am] I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so [am] I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am] more, in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Of the Jews five times I received forty [stripes] less one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned; three times I suffered shipwreck, night and day I have been in the deep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[in] journeyings often, [in] perils of waters, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils by those of my nation, [in] perils of the Gentiles, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in labour and travail, in many watches, in hunger and thirst, in many fasts, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Beside those things that are without, my daily combat is the welfare of all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is sick, and I am not sick? who stumbles, and I burn not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knows that I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall and escaped his hands.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
