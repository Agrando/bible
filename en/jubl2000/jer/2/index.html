Even though they are not gods. But my people have changed their glory for [that which] does not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this; and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters to hew them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>[Is] Israel a servant? [Is] he a homeborn [slave]? Why has he been [given over] as a prey?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The young lions roared upon him [and] yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are deserted without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even the sons of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Could this not have come upon you peradventure because thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt? to drink the waters of the Nile? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria? to drink the waters of the river [Eufrates]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thine own wickedness shall chastise thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee; know therefore and see how evil and bitter it is, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God and that my fear [is] lacking in thee, saith the Lord GOD of the hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For of old time I have broken thy yoke [and] burst thy bands; and thou didst say, I will not serve [sin]. With all this, upon every high hill and under every green tree thou dost wander, playing the harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, a seed of Truth, all of her; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap, [yet] thine iniquity is sealed before me, saith the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? See thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: [thou art] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>a wild ass used to the wilderness that breaths according to the desire of her soul; from her lust, who shall stop her? All those that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst; but thou didst say, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the thief is ashamed when he is taken, so shall the house of Israel be ashamed: they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>saying to a [piece of] firewood, Thou [art] my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned [their] back unto me, and not [their] face: but in the time of their trouble they say, Arise and deliver us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where [are] thy gods that thou hast made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble, for [according to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why will ye plead with me? Ye have all rebelled against me, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I have smitten your children in vain; they have received no correction; your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? Why do my people say, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Shall the virgin, perchance, forget her ornaments, [or] a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Why dost thou trim thy way to seek love? therefore thou hast also taught the wicked ones thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Even in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; thou didst not find them in any trespass, but by all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yet thou didst say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee because thou hast said, I did not sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Why dost thou talk so much, changing thy ways? Thou shalt also be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou shalt also go forth from him with thine hands upon thine head; for the LORD has rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
