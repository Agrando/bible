For I will cause the captivity of the land to turn as at the first, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, there shall be booths of shepherds who shall cause [the] flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counts [them], said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will confirm the good Word which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days and at that time, I will cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this [is the name] with which she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus hath the LORD said: David shall never lack a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>neither shall the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to kindle grain offerings and to do sacrifice continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus hath the LORD said; If ye can break my covenant with the day, and my covenant with the night, such that there should not be day nor night in their season,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[then] may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites and priests, my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the seed of David my servant and the Levites that minister unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Dost thou not consider what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should no longer be a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus hath the LORD said: If my covenant [remains] not with the day and the night, [and if] I have not appointed the laws of the heaven and the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then I will cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take [any] of his seed [to be] rulers over the seed of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to turn, and I will have mercy on them.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
