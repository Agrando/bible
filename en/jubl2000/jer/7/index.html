Behold, even I have seen [it], said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But go now unto my place which [was] in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now because ye have done all these works, said the LORD and I spoke well unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye did not hear; and I called you, but ye did not answer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore I will do unto [this] house, which is called by my name, in which ye trust, and unto this place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will cast you out of my sight as I have cast out all your brethren, [even] the whole seed of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Dost thou not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The sons gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead [their] dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Shall they provoke me to anger? said the LORD: [do they] not [provoke] themselves to the confusion of their own faces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground, and it shall burn and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts, the God of Israel said: Add your burnt offerings upon your sacrifices and eat flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I did not speak unto your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this thing I commanded them, saying, Hear my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the way that I have commanded you that it may be well unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they did not hearken, nor incline their ear, but walked in [their own] counsels in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward, and not forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day. I have [even] sent unto you all my servants, the prophets, daily rising up early and sending [them];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>yet they did not hearken unto me, nor incline their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt even call unto them; but they will not answer thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore thou shalt say unto them, This [is] the nation that did not hear the voice of the LORD their God, nor receive chastisement; the faith is lost and was cut off from their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Cut off thine hair, O [Jerusalem], and cast [it] away and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD has cast off and forsaken the nation of his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the LORD; they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which [is] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command [them], neither did it come into my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no longer be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter; for they shall bury in Tophet, for there shall be no [other] place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth; and there shall be no one to chase [them] away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
