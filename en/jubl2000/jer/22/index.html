Is this not to know me? said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thine eyes and thine heart [are] not but for thy covetousness and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence, to do [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus hath the LORD said concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, [saying], Ah my brother! and Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, [saying], Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Lebanon and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan and cry unto all parts: for all thy lovers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity, [but] thou didst say, I will not hear. This [has been] thy way from thy youth, that thou hast never heard my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confound thyself because of all thy malice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thou didst inhabit Lebanon, thou didst make thy nest in the cedars. How shalt thou cry out when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[As] I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet I would pluck thee from there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I will give thee into the hand of those that seek thy soul and into the hand [of those] whose face thou dost fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will cast thee out and thy mother that bore thee into another country, where ye were not born, and there ye shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land unto which they desire to return, they shall not return there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[Is] this man Coniah a despised broken idol? [Is he] a vessel in which [there is] no pleasure? Why are they cast out, he and his generation, and are cast into a land which they know not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus hath the LORD said, Write [what shall be] of this man deprived of [a] generation, a man unto whom nothing shall prosper in all the days of his life, for no man of his seed who sits upon the throne of David and rules over Judah shall prosper.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
