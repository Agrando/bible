And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S [house].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the priests and the prophets spoke unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man [is] worthy to die; for he has prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jeremiah spoke unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings and hear the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD himself will repent of the evil that he has pronounced against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for me, behold, I [am] in your hands; do with me as seems good and meet unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon its inhabitants; for of a truth the LORD has sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the princes and all the people said unto the priests and to the prophets: This man [is] not worthy to die, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the congregation of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the temple mount as the high places of a forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? Did he not fear the LORD and besought the LORD, and the LORD himself repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Shall we commit such great evil against our souls?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehoiakim the king heard his words and all his mighty men and all the princes, and the king sought to put him to death, but when Urijah understood it, he was afraid and fled and went into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, [namely], Elnathan the son of Achbor and [certain] men with him into Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
