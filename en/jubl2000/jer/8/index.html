They hold fast deceit; they refuse to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I hearkened and heard, [but] they did not speak aright: there was no man that repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? each one returned to his course as the horse rushes into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Even the stork in the heaven knows her appointed time; and the turtle [dove] and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people did not know the judgment of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How do ye say, We [are] wise, and the law of the LORD [is] with us? Behold, certainly in vain did he make the pen; the scribes [were] in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The wise [men] are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom [is] in them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I will give their wives unto others [and] their fields unto those that shall inherit [them]: for each one from the least even unto the greatest is given to greed; from the prophet even unto the priest every one deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For they have treated the destruction of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace, when [there is] no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among those that should fall: when I visit them, they shall fall, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will surely cut them off completely, said the LORD: [there are] no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fall; and [the things that] I have given them shall pass away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Upon what shall we secure ourselves? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God has put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We looked for peace, but no good [came]; [and] for a time of health, and behold trouble!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; the whole earth trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it, the city and those that dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which [will] not [be] charmed, and they shall bite you, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because of my strong sorrow, my heart [is] faint in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people that comes from a far country: [Is] not the LORD in Zion? [Is] not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images [and] with vanities of a strange [god]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the destruction of the daughter of my people I am devastated; I am in darkness; astonishment has taken hold on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[Is there] no balm in Gilead; [is there] no physician there? Why then was there no medicine for the daughter of my people?:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
