but ye have not hearkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the LORD has sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending [them]; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>when they said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD has given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD, that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD of the hosts: Because ye have not heard my words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north [wind], saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will cause them to lose the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this whole land shall be a desolation [and] an astonishment; and these Gentiles shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished, [that] I will visit upon the king of Babylon and upon that people their [own] evil, said the LORD and upon the land of the Chaldeans and will make it perpetual desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have spoken against it, with all that is written in this book, prophesied by Jeremiah against all the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many Gentiles and great kings shall serve themselves of them also; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus hath the LORD God of Israel said unto me: Take the wine cup of this fury from my hand and cause all the Gentiles, to whom I send thee, to drink of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they shall drink and be moved and become mad, before the sword that I will send among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then took I the cup from the LORD'S hand and made all the Gentiles to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>unto Jerusalem and to the cities of Judah and to its kings and to its princes, that I might place them into desolation, into astonishment, and into hissing, and into [a] curse, as this day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>unto Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his servants and to his princes and to all his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and to all the mingled people and to all the kings of the land of Uz and to all the kings of [the] land of the Philistines and to Ashkelon and [to] Gaza and [to] Ekron and to the remnant of Ashdod,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to Edom and [to] Moab and to the sons of Ammon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and to all the kings of Tyre and to all the kings of Zidon and to all the kings of the isles which are of that side of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and to Dedan, and [to] Tema and [to] Buz and to all [that are] in the utmost corners,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to all the kings of Arabia and to all the kings of the [mingled] peoples, the Arabia that dwells in the desert,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and to all the kings of Zimri and to all the kings of Elam and to all the kings of the Medes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and to all the kings of the north [wind], those of far and those of near, one with another and to all the kingdoms of the earth, which [are] upon the face of the earth and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the LORD of the hosts, the God of Israel said; Drink and be drunken, and vomit and fall, and ye shall not rise in the presence of the sword which I send among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup from thine hand to drink, then thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said: Ye must certainly drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, Behold, I begin to bring evil upon the city which is called by my name, and should ye only be absolved? Ye shall not be absolved, for I bring [the] sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, said the LORD of the hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, thou shalt prophesy against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high and from the habitation of his holiness he shall utter his voice; in fury he shall roar upon his habitation; he shall sing the song of those that tread [grapes], against all the inhabitants of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The noise came [even] to the ends of the earth; for it is judgment of the LORD with the Gentiles; he is the Judge of all flesh; he will give those [that are] wicked to the sword, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus saith the LORD of the hosts, Behold, the evil goes forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the slain of the LORD shall be in that day from [one] end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be as dung upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves [in the dust], ye principals of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like an enticing vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor [for] the principals of the flock to escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[The] voice of the cry of the shepherds and a howling of the principals of the flock [shall be heard]! For the LORD has spoiled their pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the quiet pastures shall be cut off by the fierce anger of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He has forsaken his habitation, as the [young] lion; for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of his fierce anger.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
