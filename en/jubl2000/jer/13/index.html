For thou hast taught them [to be] princes [and as] head over thee; shall not sorrows take thee as a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When thou shalt say in thine heart, Why do these things come upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered [and] thy heels made bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots?
