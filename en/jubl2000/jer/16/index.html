or what [is] our iniquity? or what [is] our sin which we have committed against the LORD our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then thou shalt say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk each one after the imagination of his evil heart, not hearkening unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore I will cause you to be cast out of this land into a land that ye do not know, [neither] ye nor your fathers; and there ye shall serve other gods day and night; for I will not grant you mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no longer be said, The LORD lives, that caused the sons of Israel to come up out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but, The LORD lives, that caused the sons of Israel to come up out of the land of the north [wind], and from all the lands where he had driven them; and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I send many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after, will I send many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For my eyes [are] upon all their ways, which they have not hid from me, neither does their iniquity hide from the presence of my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their abominations, and they have filled my inheritance with abominable things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the time of the affliction; Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and [things] in which [there is] no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make gods unto himself?
