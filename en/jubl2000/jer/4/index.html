Woe unto us, for we are given over to be spoiled!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness that thou may be saved. How long shalt thou entertain the thoughts of thy iniquity within thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the voice [is heard] from him who brings the news from Dan and from him who causes to hear the affliction from mount Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Say ye of the Gentiles; behold, cause it to be heard upon Jerusalem, Watchmen come from a far country and shall give out their voice upon the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As the watchmen of the heritages, they were upon her round about because she has been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thy way and thy doings have procured these [things] unto thee; this [is] thy wickedness because it is bitter, because it reaches unto thine heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the shofar, the alarm of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Destruction upon destruction is cried, for the whole land is destroyed; suddenly are my tents destroyed, [and] my curtains in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long shall I see the banner [and] hear the voice of the shofar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For my people [are] foolish; the ignorant sons with no understanding have not known me; they [are] wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I beheld the earth, and, behold, [it was] without order, and empty; and the heavens, and they [had] no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I beheld the mountains, and, behold, they trembled, and all the hills were destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I beheld, and, behold, [there was] no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I beheld, and, behold, Carmel was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the LORD [and] by his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet I will not make a full end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this shall the earth be made desolate, and the heavens above be darkened because I spoke; I purposed and did not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The whole city fled from the thunder of the horsemen and bowmen; they went into the thickets of the forests and climbed up upon the rocks; every city was forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou who art destroyed, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with crimson, though thou deck thee with ornaments of gold, though thou paint thy eyes with antimony, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; [thy] lovers will despise thee; they will seek thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, [that] bewails herself, [that] spreads her hands, [saying], Woe [is] me now! for my soul is faint because of the murderers.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
