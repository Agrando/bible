Who has payed attention to his word and heard [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, that the whirlwind of the LORD shall go forth with fury, and the whirlwind which is ready shall fall [grievously] upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of the LORD shall not return until he has executed and until he has performed the thoughts of his heart: in the last of the days ye shall understand it with understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[I]did not send those prophets, yet they ran; [I] did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my secret, they would also have caused my people to hear my words, and they would have caused them to return from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[Am] I a God of the near [only], said the LORD, and not a God of the far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can any hide himself in hiding places that I shall not see him? said the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what those prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long shall [this] be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies and that prophesy the deceit of their own heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do they not think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which each one tells his neighbour, so much that their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet with whom [the] dream came, let him tell [the] dream; and he with whom my word came, let him speak my true word. What [is] the chaff to the wheat? said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[Is] not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer [that] breaks the rock in pieces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, behold, I [am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words each one from his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I [am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that sweeten their tongues and say, He said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, I [am] against those that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and did tell them, and caused my people to err by their lies, and by their flattery; yet I did not send them, nor command them; and they did not profit this people at all, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this people or the prophet or the priest shall ask thee, saying, What [is] the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will forsake you, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And [as for] the prophet and the priest and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will visit upon that man and upon his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus shall ye say each one to his neighbour and each one to his brother, What has the LORD answered? and, What has the LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And never again shall it come to [your] memory to say, The burden of the LORD; for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of the hosts, our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What has the LORD answered thee? and, What has the LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus hath the LORD said: Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will uproot you from my presence and the city that I gave you and your fathers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and I will place an everlasting reproach upon you, and eternal shame, which shall never be forgotten.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
