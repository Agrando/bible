Yet thou, O LORD, [art] in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; do not leave us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus hath the LORD said unto this people, Thus have they loved to move, nor have they refrained their feet; therefore the LORD does not have them in [his] will; he will now remember their iniquity and visit their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the LORD said unto me, Do not pray for this people for [their] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by sword and by famine and by pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I said, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you true peace in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I did not send them, neither have I commanded them, neither did I speak unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision, divination, vanity, and the deceit of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus hath the LORD said concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name which I did not send and that say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have no one to bury them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters; for I will pour their wickedness upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them: Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold those that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest walked around in circles in the land, and they did not know [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? Hath thy soul loathed Zion? Why didst thou cause us to be smitten when no healing remains for us? We waited for peace, and [there was] no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, [and] the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not cast [us] away; for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory; remember, do not break thy covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there [any] among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause it to rain? or can the heavens give rain? [art] not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee, for thou hast made all these [things].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
