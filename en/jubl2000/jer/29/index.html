and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>take wives and beget sons and daughters; give wives unto your sons and give husbands unto your daughters, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be multiplied there and not diminished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For thus hath the LORD of the hosts the God of Israel said: Let not your prophets and your diviners that [are] in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For thus hath the LORD said, That after seventy years are accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and quicken my good word upon you to cause you to return to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I know the thoughts that I think concerning you, said the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you the end that you wait for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then ye shall call upon me, and ye shall walk [in my ways] and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall seek me, and find [me], for ye shall seek me with all your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will be found of you, said the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the Gentiles and from all the places where I have driven you, said the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But ye have said, The LORD has raised us up prophets in Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[know] that thus hath the LORD said of the king that sits upon the throne of David and of all the people that dwell in this city [and] of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>thus hath the LORD of the hosts said: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence and will make them like the evil figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will give them over as a reproach to all the kingdoms of the earth, as a curse, and as an astonishment, and a hissing, and an affront, unto all the Gentiles where I have driven them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because they did not hearken unto my words, said the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending [them]; but ye did not hear, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have cast out of Jerusalem unto Babylon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts the God of Israel said [regarding] Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and [regarding] Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy falsely unto you in my name; Behold, [I] deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who [are] in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken a word falsely in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know and [am] a witness, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[Thus] shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts the God of Israel spoken, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that [are] at Jerusalem and to Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah and to all the priests, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The LORD has made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should preside in the house of the LORD over every man [that is] furious and prophesies, putting him in the prison and in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now therefore why hast thou not reprehended Jeremiah of Anathoth, for prophesying [falsely] unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For therefore he sent unto us [in] Babylon, saying, This [captivity is] long: build houses and dwell [in them] and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus hath the LORD said [concerning] Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah has prophesied unto you, and I did not send him, and he caused you to trust upon [a] lie;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>therefore thus hath the LORD said; Behold, I visit upon Shemaiah the Nehelamite and upon his generation: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold that good which I do unto my people, said the LORD, because he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
