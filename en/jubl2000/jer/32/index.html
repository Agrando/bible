Then I knew that this [was] the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that [was] in Anathoth and weighed him the money, [even] seventeen shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I subscribed the evidence and sealed [it] and took witnesses and weighed [him] the money in the balances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I took the evidence of the purchase, [both] that which was sealed [according] to the law and custom, and that which was open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's [son] and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the Jews that were in the court of the guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts, the God of Israel, said: Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both [that] which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus hath the LORD of the hosts the God of Israel said: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be bought [and sold] again in this land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, [and] there is nothing hidden from thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that thou dost show mercy in thousands and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them, the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of the hosts, [is] his name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>great in counsel and magnificent in works: for thine eyes [are] open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give unto each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, [even] unto this day, and in Israel, and in the man, and hast made thee a name, as at this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with great terror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they came in and possessed it; but they did not hear thy voice, neither did they walk in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou didst command them to do, therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold the siege engines are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence, and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou dost see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy the field for money and take witnesses; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all flesh: peradventure shall any thing be covered unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore thus hath the LORD said; Behold, I give this city into the hand of [the] Chaldeans, and into [the] hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done only evil before me from their youth: for the sons of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this city has been unto me [as] a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they have turned unto me the back and not the face: when I taught them, rising up early and teaching [them], yet they did not hearken to receive chastisement;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they built altars unto Baal, which [are] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] unto Molech; which I did not command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto this city, of which ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine and by the pestilence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>behold, I will gather them out of all countries where I have driven them in my anger, in my fury and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their sons after them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and I will make an eternal covenant with them, that I will not turn away from doing them good, and I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, I will rejoice with them doing them good, and I will plant them in this land with truth, with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For thus hath the LORD said; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I speak regarding them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they shall possess inheritance in this land, of which ye say, [It is] desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and seal [them] and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the places about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah and in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the south; for I will cause their captivity to turn, saith the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
