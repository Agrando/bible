If it seems good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seems ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land [is] before thee; where it seems good and convenient for thee to go, go there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now while he had [not yet replied] that he would go back, [the captain said], Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah and dwell with him among the people, or go wherever it seems convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and sent him forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jeremiah came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all the princes of the army which [were] in the field, [even] they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor over the land and had committed unto him the men and the women and the children and the poor of the land, those that were not carried away captive to Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for me, behold, I dwell in Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us; but ye, gather ye the wine and the bread and the oil and put [them] in your vessels and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Likewise when all the Jews that [were] in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and that [were] in all the lands heard how the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>all these Jews returned out of all places where they were driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedalias in Mizpah, and gathered wine and much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the princes of the armies that [were] in the fields came to Gedaliah to Mizpah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, I will go now, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know [it]; why should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in Judah perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing, for thou dost speak falsely of Ishmael.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
