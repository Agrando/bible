Then I answered, and said, Amen, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day [that] I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, [even] unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Hear my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they did not hear, nor did they incline their ear, but walked each one in the imagination of their evil heart; therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded [them] to do; but they did [them] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have returned to the iniquities of their first fathers, who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus hath the LORD said, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense, who shall not be able to save them in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For [according to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and [according to] the number of thy streets, O Jerusalem, have ye set up altars of confusion, [even] altars to burn incense unto Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them for I will not hear [them] in the time that they cry unto me in their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What [part] has my beloved in my house, [seeing] she has wrought lewdness with many? The holy flesh shall pass from upon thee, for in thy evil thou didst glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and in appearance. At the voice of a great word he caused fire to be kindled upon it, and they broke her branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the LORD of the hosts, that planted thee, has pronounced evil against thee for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD gave me knowledge [of it], and I experienced [it]: then thou didst show me their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I [was] like a ram [or] an ox [that] is brought to the slaughter; for I did not understand that they had devised devices against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may no longer be remembered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O LORD of the hosts, that judges righteously, that tries the kidneys and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them, for unto thee I have uncovered my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, thus hath the LORD said regarding the men of Anathoth that seek thy life, saying, Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD that thou not die by our hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>therefore, thus hath the LORD of the hosts said, Behold, I visit: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, [even] the year of their visitation.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
