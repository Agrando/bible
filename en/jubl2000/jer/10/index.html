Do not be afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither do they have power to do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Forasmuch as [there is] none like unto thee, O LORD; thou [art] great, and thy name [is] great in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who would not fear thee, O King of the Gentiles? for unto thee does it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise [men] of the Gentiles and in all their kingdoms, [there is] none like unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they shall become altogether carnal and foolish. The stock [is] a doctrine of vanities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Silver spread into plates shall be brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, shall the workman work and the hands of the founder: they shall dress them in blue and purple: they [are] all the work of cunning [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the LORD God [is] the Truth, he himself [is] Living God and Everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembles, and the Gentiles shall not be able to abide his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens or the earth, [even] they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that makes the earth by his power, he that orders the world with his wisdom and extends the heavens with his intelligence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>at his voice, [there is] given a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causes the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes the lightnings with the rain and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every man is carnal in [his] knowledge: let every founder be ashamed of his graven image: for his molten image [is] falsehood, and [there is] no spirit in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They [are] vanity [and] the work of scorn: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The portion of Jacob [is] not like them: for he [is] the Former of all [things], and Israel [is] the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of the hosts [is] his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up thy wares out of the lands, O inhabitant of the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus hath the LORD said, Behold, that this time I will throw out the inhabitants of the land with a sling and will afflict them, that they may find [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous, but I said, Truly this [is] my sickness, and I must bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent is destroyed, and all my cords [are] broken: my sons were taken from me, and they [are] lost; [there is] no one to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the pastors are become carnal and have not sought the LORD; therefore they did not understand, and all their flocks scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, the voice of the rumour is come, and a great commotion out of the land of the north [wind] to make the cities of Judah desolate [and] a den of dragons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O LORD, I know that man is not the lord of his [own] way: [it is] not in man that walks to order his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O LORD, chastise me, but with judgment; not with thine anger lest thou bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy fury upon the Gentiles that do not know thee and upon the nations that do not call on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob and devoured him and consumed him and have destroyed his habitation.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
