Thy valley has slipped, O backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures, she that saith, Who shall come against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I bring fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of the hosts, from all sides; and ye shall be driven out each man right forth in the direction he is facing; and no one shall gather up him that wanders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And afterward I will turn again the captivity of the sons of Ammon, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Concerning Edom, thus hath the LORD of the hosts said: Is there no more wisdom in Teman? Has the counsel of the wise perished? Is their wisdom corrupted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee, turn back, hide in the deeps to remain, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, at the time [that] I have to visit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If grapegatherers came against thee, would they not leave [some] gleaning grapes? If thieves by night, they will take what they have need of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I will make Esau bare, I will uncover his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his seed shall be destroyed, and his brethren and his neighbours and he shall no longer be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leave thy fatherless children; I will raise them; and thy widows shall trust in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus hath the LORD said: Behold, those who were not condemned to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and shalt thou be absolved of everything? Thou shalt not be absolved, but thou shalt surely drink [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have sworn by myself, said the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have heard the news, that from the LORD a messenger had been sent unto the Gentiles, [saying], Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, behold, I have placed thee as small among the Gentiles [and] despised among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thy arrogance has deceived thee, [and] the pride of thine heart, O thou that dost dwell in the clefts of the rock, that dost hold the height of the mountain: though thou should make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from there, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also Edom shall be a desolation; every one that goes by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all its plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour [cities] thereof, said the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the strong habitation: for I will make rest and make him run from upon her, and he who [is] chosen I shall appoint over her; for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD that he has taken against Edom; and his thoughts, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out; surely he shall destroy their habitations with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall; at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, he shall rise up and fly as the eagle and spread his wings over Bozrah; and at that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad, for they have heard bad news; they have melted in waters of feebleness; they cannot be reassured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Damascus is waxed feeble [and] turns herself to flee, and fear has seized on [her]; anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How did they not forgive the city of praise, the city of my joy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, said the LORD of the hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the houses of Benhadad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote, thus hath the LORD said; Arise ye, go up to Kedar and destroy the men of the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Their tents and their flocks shall they take away; they shall take to themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels; and they shall invoke fear on every side against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Flee, get you far off, dwell in the deeps that [ye] may stand, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, said the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you and has conceived a purpose against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwells without care, saith the LORD, which has neither gates nor bars, [which] dwells alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter them into all [the] winds, throwing them out unto the utmost corner; and from all their sides I will bring their ruin, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons [and] a desolation for ever: no man shall abide there, nor [any] son of man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet regarding Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said: Behold, I break the bow of Elam, the foundation of their might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And upon Elam I will bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I will cause Elam to fear before their enemies and before those that seek their soul; and I will bring evil upon them, [even] my fierce anger, said the LORD; and I will send the sword after them until I have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will set my throne in Elam and will destroy from there the king and the princes, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it shall come to pass in the last of the days [that] I will turn again the captivity of Elam, said the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
