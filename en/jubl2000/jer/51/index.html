Behold, I raise up against Babylon and against her inhabitants that rise up against me from the heart, a destroying wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I will send unto Babylon fanners that shall fan her and shall empty her land; for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>[I shall say] to the archer that bends his bow and unto him that lifts himself up in his brigandine, Spare ye not her young men; utterly destroy all her host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans and [those that are] thrust through in her streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Israel and Judah have not been made widows of their God, of the LORD of the hosts, though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee out of the midst of Babylon and deliver each one his soul that ye not perish because of her iniquity, for this [is] the time of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Babylon [has been] a golden cup in the LORD'S hand that made all the earth drunken: the Gentiles have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed; howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We applied [the medicine to] Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go each one into his own land; for her judgment is come unto heaven and is lifted up [even] to the clouds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The LORD has brought our righteousness to light; come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Make bright the arrows; gather the shields; the LORD has awakened the spirit of the kings of the Medes; for his thought [is] against Babylon to destroy her; for it [is] vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Set up the banner upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for the LORD has deliberated and shall put into effect that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O thou that dwellest among many waters, rich in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy covetousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD of the hosts has sworn by himself, [saying], Surely I will fill thee with men as with locusts; and they shall sing the song [of the winepress] against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He is the one who makes the earth by his power; he upholds the world by his wisdom and extends the heavens by his intelligence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>he who gives with [his] voice a multitude of waters from heaven, then he causes the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings with the rain and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every man has become carnal and is without knowledge; let every founder be ashamed of the graven image: for his molten image [is] falsehood, and [there is] no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They [are] vanity, the work of errors; in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The portion of Jacob [is] not like them; for he [is] the Former of all things; and [Israel is] the rod of his inheritance; the LORD of the hosts [is] his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou [art] my hammer, O weapons of war: for with thee I will break in pieces the Gentiles, and with thee I will destroy kingdoms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and with thee I will break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee I will break in pieces the chariots and their riders;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>with thee also I will break in pieces men and women; and with thee I will break in pieces old and young; and with thee I will break in pieces young men and virgins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee I will break in pieces dukes and princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, I [am] against thee, O destroying mountain, said the LORD, which destroys all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a burnt mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Set ye up a banner in the land, blow the shofar among the Gentiles, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause [the] horses to come up as raised up locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Prepare the nations against her: the kings of Media, the captains thereof, and all the princes thereof, and all the land of their dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the land shall tremble and sorrow for every thought of the LORD is confirmed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight; they have remained in [their] holds; their might has failed; they became as women: the [enemies] have burned her dwellingplaces; they have broken her bars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken in all places,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the fords were taken, and they have burned the reeds with fire, and the men of war were astounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For thus hath the LORD of the hosts, the God of Israel said: The daughter of Babylon [is] like a threshingfloor; [it is] now time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a dragon; he has filled his belly with my delicates; he has cast me out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The violence against me and my flesh [be] upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore thus hath the LORD said: Behold, I judge thy cause and shall take thy vengeance; and I will dry up her sea and make her flowing [waters] dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They shall roar together like lions; they shall roar as lions' whelps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>In their heat I will place their feasts [before them], and I will make them drunken that they may rejoice and sleep an eternal sleep and not wake, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>How is Sheshach a prey! and how is she who was the praise of the whole earth taken! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the Gentiles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The sea is come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Her cities were devastated, the land dry and desert, a land in which no man dwells, neither shall [any] son of man pass thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I will visit Bel himself in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up; and the Gentiles shall not flow together any more unto him; and the wall of Babylon shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Come out of the midst of her, my people, and save each one his life from the fierce anger of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And lest your heart faint, and ye fear because of the news that shall be heard in the land; in one year shall the news come, and after that in the [next] year [shall come] the rumour, and [then shall come] the violence in the land, and the ruler over him who rules.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore, behold, the days come that I will visit the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be ashamed, and all her dead shall fall in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the heavens and the earth and all that [is] therein shall sing praises over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come unto her from the north, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>As Babylon [has caused the] dead of Israel to fall, so because of Babylon [the] dead of all the earth fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, do not tarry: remember the LORD for many days, and remember Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>We are ashamed, because we have heard the reproach; confusion has covered our faces; for strangers are come against the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will visit her graven images; and through all her [land the wounded] unto death shall groan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify her strength upon high, [yet] from me shall destroyers come unto her, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The sound of a cry [comes] from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Because the LORD destroys Babylon and takes out of her the many thunders, her waves shall roar; like many waters shall be the sound of their voice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>because the destroyer is come against her, [even] upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bow is broken: for the LORD God of recompenses shall surely requite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise [men], her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep an eternal sleep and shall not wake, saith the King, whose name [is] the LORD of the hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly cast down, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and peoples and nations shall labour in vain in the fire [to save her], and they shall become weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The word which Jeremiah the prophet sent to Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And [this] Seraiah [was] the chief steward of the bedchambers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, [even] all these words that are written against Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon and shalt see and shalt read all these things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>then thou shalt say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that no one shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, [that] thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be overcome. Thus far [are] the words of Jeremiah.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
