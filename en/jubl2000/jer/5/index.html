Thou hast stricken them, but they did not feel it; thou hast consumed them, [but] they have refused to receive chastisement; they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore I said, Surely these [are] poor; they have become foolish; for they do not know the way of the LORD [nor] the judgment of their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will go unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, [and] the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke [and] burst the bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, [and] a wolf of the desert shall destroy them and a tiger shall lie in wait over their cities; anyone that goes out from there shall be torn in pieces because their rebellions have been multiplied, [and] their backslidings are increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How shall I pardon thee for this? Thy sons have forsaken me and sworn by [them that are] not gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They were [as] fed horses in the morning; each one neighed after his neighbour's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I not visit for these [things]? said the LORD; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go ye up upon her walls and destroy; but make not a full end; take away her battlements for they [are] not the LORD'S.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have made a firm decision to rebel against me, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have denied the LORD and said, He [is] not; and evil shall not come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but the prophets shall become like wind, and there is no word in them: thus shall it be done unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore thus hath the LORD God of the hosts said: Because ye have spoken this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, I will bring a nation upon you from afar, O house of Israel, saith the LORD; it [is] a mighty nation, it [is] an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou dost not know, neither dost [thou] understand what they say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Their quiver [is] as an open sepulcher; they [are] all mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread, [which] thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees; and thy fenced cities, in which thou dost trust, they shall bring to nothing with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why does the LORD our God do all these [things] unto us? Then thou shalt answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land [that is] not yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Declare this in the house of Jacob and publish it in Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hear now this, O foolish people and without heart, who have eyes and do not see; who have ears, and do not hear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do ye not fear me? saith the LORD; will ye not tremble at my presence, who placed the sand [for] the bound of the sea by an eternal order, which cannot be broken? Storms shall raise themselves up, yet they shall not prevail; their waves shall roar, yet they shall not pass over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this people have a false and rebellious heart; they turned and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Neither do they say in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God that gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; he shall keep us [with] the appointed weeks of the harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your iniquities have turned away these [things], and your sins have withheld good [things] from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For among my people were found wicked [men]: they lay in wait as he that sets snares; they set a trap of perdition to catch men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As a cage full of birds, so [are] their houses full of deceit; thus they became great and rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They are become fat; they shine; yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they did not judge the cause, the cause of the fatherless; with all this they made themselves prosperous; and they did not judge the cause of the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Shall I not visit for these [things]? saith the LORD; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>A horrible and ugly thing is committed in the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The prophets prophesied falsely, and the priests bore rule by their hands; and my people love [to have it] so. What will ye do in the end thereof?:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
