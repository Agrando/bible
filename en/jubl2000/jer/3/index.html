Is she not a land that is now completely polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see if there is anywhere thou hast not been ravished. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore the rain has been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and thou dost have a whore's forehead, thou dost refuse to be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou [art] the guide of my youth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will he reserve [his anger] for ever? will he keep [it] to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done as many evil things as thou could.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The LORD said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen [that] which rebellious Israel has done? She is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I said after she had done all these [things], Turn thou unto me. But she did not return. And her rebellious sister Judah saw [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I saw when for all the causes by which rebellious Israel committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce; yet her rebellious sister Judah did not fear, but went and played the harlot also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass through [her judging] her whoredom to be a light [thing] that the land became defiled and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And yet for all this her rebellious sister Judah has never turned unto me with her whole heart, but untruthfully, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said unto me, The rebellious Israel has justified her soul in comparison to the treacherous Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go and proclaim these words toward the north [wind] and say, Return, thou rebellious Israel, said the LORD [and] I will not cause my anger to fall upon you; for I [am] merciful, said the LORD, [and] I will not keep [anger] for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast rebelled against the LORD thy God and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not heard my voice, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Turn, O rebellious sons, said the LORD; for I am your Lord, and I will take you one of a city and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land; in those days, said the LORD, they shall no longer say, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit [it]; neither shall [that] be done any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the Gentiles shall congregate unto it in the name of the LORD in Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the hardness of their evil heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In those times they shall go out from the house of Judah unto the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north [wind] to the land which I caused your fathers to inherit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I said, How shall I place thee as sons and give thee the desirable land, the heritage that the hosts of Gentiles desire? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father and shalt not turn away from following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely [as] the woman breaks the faith of her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping of the supplications of the sons of Israel; for they have perverted their way, [and] they have forgotten the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Return, ye rebellious sons, [and] I will heal your rebellion.
