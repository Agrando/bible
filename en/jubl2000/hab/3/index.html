Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was filled with his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And [his] brightness was as the light; he had horns [coming] out of his hand; and there [was] hidden his strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Before his face went mortality, and burning coals went forth from his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He stood and measured the earth; he beheld and drove out the Gentiles; and the ancient mountains crumbled, the ancient hills; the ways of the world bowed unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw the tents of Cushan as nothing, [and] the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh LORD, wast thou displeased against the rivers? [was] thine anger against the rivers? [was] thy wrath even against the sea when thou didst ride upon thine horses [and] thy chariots of saving health?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thy bow was entirely uncovered, and the oaths unto the tribes, eternal word, when thou didst divide the earth with rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The mountains saw thee, [and] they trembled: the overflowing of the waters passed by; the abyss uttered its voice; the deep lifted up its hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun [and] the moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went [and] at the shining of thy glittering spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou didst tread upon the land in wrath; thou didst thresh the Gentiles in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou didst go forth to save thy people, to save with thine anointed; thou didst shatter the head of the house of the wicked by uncovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou didst strike through with his staffs the heads of his villages, who as a whirlwind attempted to scatter me; their pride [was] as to devour the poor secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou didst make a way through the sea for thine horses [through] the heap of great waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my seat, that I might rest in the day of trouble when he comes up unto the people to destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall] fruit [be] on the vines; the labour of the olive shall lie, and the cultivated fields shall yield no food; the sheep shall be cut off from the fold, and [there shall be] no herd in the stalls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will joy in the God of my saving health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The LORD God [is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and upon my high places he will cause me to walk victorious in my instruments of music.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
