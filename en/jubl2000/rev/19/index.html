And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the twenty-four elders and the four animals fell [upon their faces] and worshipped God that was seated upon the throne, saying, Amen! Halelu-JAH!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants and ye that fear him, both small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard as it were the voice of a great company and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Halelu-JAH; for the Lord God almighty reigns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us be glad and rejoice and give glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his bride has made herself ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright: for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto me, Write, Blessed are those who are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, These are the true words of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See [thou do it] not: I am thy fellowservant and with thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw the heaven open, and behold a white horse; and he that was seated upon him [was] called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his eyes [were] as a flame of fire, and on his head [were] many crowns; and he had a name written, that no one has known, but he himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he [was] clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the armies that are in the heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the Gentiles; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he has on [his] garment and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that flew in the midst of the heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that ye may eat flesh of kings and flesh of captains, and flesh of mighty men and flesh of horses and of those that sit on them and the flesh of everyone, free and bond, both small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that was seated upon the horse and against his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the beast was taken and with it the false prophet that wrought miracles in its presence, with which he had deceived those that had taken the mark of the beast and had worshipped its image.
