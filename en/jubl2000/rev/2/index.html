These things, saith he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear those who are evil; and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and hast suffered, and doth suffer and for my name's sake hast laboured and hast not fainted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless I have against thee that thou hast left thy first [love], charity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember, therefore, from where thou art fallen and repent and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And unto the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These things, saith the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know thy works and tribulation and poverty, (but thou art rich), and [I know] the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days; be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things, saith he, who has the sharp sword with two edges:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know thy works and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's throne [is], and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith, even in those days in which Antipas [was] my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwellest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against thee because thou hast there those that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So hast thou also those that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a small white stone and in the stone a new name written, which no one knows except the one that receives [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things, saith the Son of God, who has his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet like unto brilliant metal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I have known thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last [to be] more than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel (who calls herself a prophetess) to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I have given her time to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I will cast her into a bed and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I AM he that searches the kidneys and hearts, and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But unto you I say and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan (as they say); I will put upon you no other burden</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But that which ye have [already] hold fast until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he that overcomes and keeps my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Gentiles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter they shall be broken to shivers, even as I received of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
