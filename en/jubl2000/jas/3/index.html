If any man offends not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to govern the whole body with restraint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, we put bits ([or restraint]) in the horses' mouths to persuade them, and we govern their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the ships, which though [they are] so great are driven of fierce winds, yet they are governed with a very small rudder, wherever the governor desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the same manner, the tongue is a very small member and boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of beings in the sea may be tamed and is tamed by mankind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but no man can tame the tongue, which is an evil that cannot be restrained and is full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless God, even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a fountain send forth at the same place [both] sweet and bitter [water]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can the fig tree, my brethren, produce olive berries? or the vine, figs? In the same manner no fountain [can] yield both salt water and fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and ready among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, boast not and do not be liars against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but [is] earthly, natural, diabolical.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where there is envy and contention, there [is] confusion and every perverse work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, modest, benevolent, full of mercy and of good fruits, not judgmental, unfeigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace unto those that make peace.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
