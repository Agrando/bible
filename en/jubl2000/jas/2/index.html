Do not the rich oppress you with tyranny and draw you [with violence] to the courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If ye truly fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin and are accused of the law as rebels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whosoever shall have kept the whole law, and then offends in one [point] is made guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not murder. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou [commit] murder, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak ye and so do as those that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment without mercy shall be done unto the one that has showed no mercy; and mercy boasts against judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My brethren, What shall it profit though someone says [that] they have faith and do not have works? Shall this type of faith be able to save them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says unto them, Depart in peace; be [ye] warmed and filled; but ye do not give them those things which are needful for the body; what [shall it] profit them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so faith, if it does not have works, is dead in and of itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But someone may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works; show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well; the demons also believe and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O vain man, dost thou desire to know that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Dost thou not see how the faith worked together with his works, and the faith was complete by the works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And that the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness, and he was called the Friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent [them] out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
