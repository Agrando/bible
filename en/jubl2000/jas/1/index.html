For [he] that doubts is like the wave of the sea which is driven of the wind and is tossed from one side to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For let not such [a] man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in his high status;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and he who is rich, in his low status, because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and its flower falls, and the beautiful appearance of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is the man that [patiently] endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those that love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither does he tempt anyone:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But each one is tempted, when they are drawn away of their own lust and enticed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He, of his own will, has begotten us with the word of truth, that we should be the firstfruits of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So then, leave all uncleanness and remains of malice and receive with meekness the word ingested within you, which is able to cause your souls to be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if anyone hears the word and does not put it into practice, this same is like unto the man beholding his natural face in a mirror:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he considered himself and went his way and in one hour forgot what he was like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But whosoever has looked [attentively] into the perfect law of liberty and has persevered [in it], not being a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, the same shall be blessed in their deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone among you thinks to be religious and does not bridle their tongue, but deceives his own heart, his religion [is] vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation [and] to keep thyself unspotted from this world.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
