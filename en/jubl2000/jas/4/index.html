From here [that is to say], of your lusts which fight in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ye covet and have not; ye murder, and have envy and cannot obtain; ye fight and war and have not that which ye desire because ye ask not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore that desires to be a friend of the world, makes himself the enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do ye think that the scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives greater grace. Therefore he says, God resists the proud, but gives grace unto the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Submit yourselves, therefore, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be afflicted and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning and [your] joy to heaviness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Murmur not against one another, brethren. He that speaks evil of [his] brother and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law and judges the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a keeper of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou to judge another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, ye that say, Today and tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and ye do not know what shall be tomorrow. For what [is] your life? Certainly it is a vapour that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye [ought] to say instead, If the Lord wills, and if we live, we shall do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now ye boast in your arrogance; all such glory is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore sin is [still] in the one that knows to do good and does not do [it].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
