And they swore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Johanan, the son of Eliashib; and [when] he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he mourned because of the transgression of those that had been carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the sons of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and of the elders, all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus were all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together unto Jerusalem within three days. It [was] the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month; and all the people sat in the plaza of the house of God, trembling because of [this] matter and because of the rains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Ezra, the priest, stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed because ye have taken strange women, thus increasing the guiltiness of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, therefore, make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers and do his will; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the lands and from the strange women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, Let it be done according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the people [are] many, and [it is] a time of much rain, and there is no strength to stand in the street; neither [is this] a work of one day or two; for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let our rulers of all the congregation now stand, and let all those who have taken strange women in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of each city and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter is turned from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and Jahaziah, the son of Tikvah, were placed over this matter; and Meshullam and Shabbethai, the Levites, helped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sons of the captivity did so.
