Uthai and Zabbud and with them seventy males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava, and there we encamped three days, and having searched among the people and the priests, I did not find there any of the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then I commissioned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, principals, also Joiarib and Elnathan, men of understanding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and I sent them unto Iddo, the captain at the place of Casiphia, and I put words in their mouth that they should speak unto Iddo [and] to his brethren, the Nethinims, at the place of Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel;

but his power and his wrath [is] against all those that forsake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he was intreated of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then I separated twelve of the principals of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God, which the king and his counsellors and his princes and all those that were of Israel had offered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I weighed, therefore, unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels of one hundred talents [and] of gold one hundred talents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams, and two vessels of clean brass, precious as gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I said unto them, Ye [are] holiness unto the LORD; the vessels [are] holiness also; and the silver and the gold [are] a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Watch and keep [them] until you weigh [them] before the princes of the priests and the Levites and of the princes of the fathers of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and of the gold and of the vessels, to bring [them] to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we came to Jerusalem and abode there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the priest; and with him [was] Eleazar, the son of Phinehas; and with them [was] Jozabad, the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, the son of Binnui, Levites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>by number [and] by weight of each one; and all the weight was written at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Those that had been carried away, the sons of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he goats [as] sin; all [this was] a burnt offering unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants and captains of the other side the river, which favoured the people and the house of God.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
