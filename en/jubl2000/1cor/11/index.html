Do ye not have houses to eat and to drink in? or do ye despise the church of God and shame those that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and when he had given thanks, he broke [it] and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After the same manner also [he took] the cup, after he had eaten supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood; do this each time that ye drink, in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For each time that ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye declare the Lord's death until he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore whoever shall eat this bread and drink [this] cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let each man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we would examine ourselves, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But being judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, my brothers, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home; that ye not come together unto judgment. And I will set the rest in order when I come.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
