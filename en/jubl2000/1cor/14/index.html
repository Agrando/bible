I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the place of the ignorant say, Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what thou sayest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, be not children in understanding, howbeit in malice be ye children; but in understanding be perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, In other tongues and with other lips I will speak unto this people; and yet for all that, they will not hear me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, tongues are for a sign, not to those that believe, but to those that do not believe; but prophecy is not for those that do not believe, but for those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If, therefore, the whole church is come together into one place and all speak with tongues, and there come in [those that are] unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that does not believe or [one] unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on [his] face, he will worship God, declaring that God is indeed in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How is it then, brothers? when ye come together, each one of you has a psalm, has doctrine, has tongues, has revelation, has interpretation. Let all things be done unto edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If anyone speaks in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course; and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If [any thing] is revealed to another that sits by, let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not [the God] of disorder, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be in subjection, as also saith the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a dishonest thing for women to speak in [the] congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What? Did the word of God come out from you? or did it come unto you only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But anyone that ignores [them] shall be ignored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, brothers, earnestly pursue prophecy and do not forbid to speak with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But let all things be done decently and in order.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
