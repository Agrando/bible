If the whole [were] hearing, where [would] the smelling [be]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has set the members each one of them in the body, as it has pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they were all one member, where [would] the body [be]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now [they are] indeed many members, yet but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For those members of the body, which seem to be weaker, are much more necessary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those [members] of the body which we think to be more vile, these we dress with more abundant honour; and those in us who are [more] indecent have more honesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For those in us who are more honest need nothing, but God has ordered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [one] which lacked,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there should be no contradiction in the body, but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; or if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God did set certain [ones] in the church: first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that faculties, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[Are] all apostles?
