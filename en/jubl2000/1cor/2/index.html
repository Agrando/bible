Even so no one has known the things of God, but the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that God has given us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but with doctrine of the Holy Spirit, jointly fitting spiritual things by spiritual [means].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the natural man does not perceive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he understand [them] because they are spiritually discerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he that is spiritual discerns all things, yet he is discerned by no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For who has known the understanding of the Lord?
