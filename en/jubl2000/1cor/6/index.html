Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goes to judgment against brother, and that before the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore there is certainly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather suffer [the] wrong? why do ye not rather be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But ye do wrong and defraud and [do] this to [your] brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you, but [now] ye are washed, but [now] ye are sanctified, but [now] ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Foods [are] for the belly, and the belly for foods; but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God, who raised up the Lord, will also raise up us by his own power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make [them] the members of a harlot? In no wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What? know ye not that he who is joined to the harlot is one body [with her]? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication. Any [other] sin that a man does is outside the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit [who is] in you, whom ye have of God, and that ye are not your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
