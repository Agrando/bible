But when he says all things are put under [him, it is] clear that he is excepted, who did put all things under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also subject himself unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I die daily to stay in the glory of having taught you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what does it advantage me, if the dead do not rise? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be not deceived: evil companions corrupt good character.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Watch diligently, and sin not; for some do not know God: I speak [this] to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not brought to life, unless it dies [first];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but bare grain: it may be of wheat or of some other [grain];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but God gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to each seed its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh [is] not the same flesh, but [there is] one [kind of] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another of birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>[There are] also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the heavenly glory [is] one [thing], and the earthly [glory is] another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>One [thing is the] glory of the sun, and another [the] glory of the moon, and another [the] glory of the stars; for [one] star differs from [another] star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall be raised in incorruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>it is sown in dishonour, it shall be raised with glory; it is sown in weakness, it shall be raised with power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>it is sown a natural body, it shall be raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a life-giving Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Howbeit the spiritual is not first, but the natural; and afterward, that which is spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man [is] the Lord of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As [is] the earthy, such [are] those also that are earthy; and as [is] the heavenly, such also [are] those that are heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I show you a mystery: We shall all indeed be raised, but we shall not all be changed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised without corruption, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the word that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O death, where [is] thy sting? O Hades, where [is] thy victory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death [is] sin, and the power of sin [is] the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks [be] to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
