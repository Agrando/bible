Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest any should say that [ye were] baptized into my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the stake of Christ should be made void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the word of the stake is foolishness to those that perish, but unto us who are saved, it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the philosopher of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For in the wisdom of God, since the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock and unto the Gentiles foolishness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but unto those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ [is] the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For that which is foolish of God is wiser than men, and that which is weak of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For look upon your vocation, brothers, that ye are not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but rather God has chosen that which is the foolishness of the world to confound the wise, and God has chosen that which is the weakness of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and that which is vile of the world and that which is despised God has chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things that are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that no flesh should glory in his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But of him ye are [reborn] in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
