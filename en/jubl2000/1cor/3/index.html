But let each one see how the building is built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For no one can lay another foundation than that laid, which is Jesus the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if anyone builds upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the work of each one shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire; the work of each one, whatever sort it is, the fire shall put it to test.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If the work of anyone abides which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If anyone's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy that one; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive themself. If any one among you seems to be wise in this age, let them become a fool that they may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.
