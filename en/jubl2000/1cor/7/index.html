But each one has his own gift from God, one after this manner and another after that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say, therefore, to the unmarried [men] and widowers, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they do not have [the gift of] continence, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife separate from [her] husband;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and if she separates, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to [her] husband, and let not the husband put away [his] wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But to the rest I speak, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that does not believe, and she consents to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman who has a husband that does not believe and if he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbelieving [spouse] separates, let them separate. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases], but God has called us to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save [thy] husband? or what knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save [thy] wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let them walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is anyone called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is anyone called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let each abide in the same calling in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Art thou called [being] a servant? care not for it; but if thou may be made free, use [it] rather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he that is called in the Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord's freeman; likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Christ's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ye are bought with a price; do not make yourselves the servants of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Each one, brothers, in that [state] in which he was called, let him abide with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, yet I give my advice, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I hold, therefore, this to be good because of the present distress, that [it is] good for a man to be thus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have affliction in the flesh, but I forbear you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brothers, the time [is] short; for the rest, let those that have wives be as though they had none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those that use this world, as not using [it as their own], for the fashion of this world passes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I would have you without worry. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please [his] wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There is [a] difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried [woman] cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please [her] husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is honourable and that ye may attend upon the Lord without impediment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if anyone thinks it uncomely regarding his daughter, if she passes the bloom of life, and need so requires, let him do what he will, he does not sin: let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nevertheless, he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has liberty regarding his own, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his daughter, does well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then he that gives [her] in marriage does well, but he that does not give [her] in marriage does better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is free [and may] be married to whom she will, if it is in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she shall be more blessed if she so abides, after my counsel, and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
