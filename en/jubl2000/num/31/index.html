31</strong></div><p><span class="verse"><a name="1">1</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Avenge the sons of Israel upon the Midianites; afterward thou shalt be gathered unto thy peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses spoke unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war and let them go against the Midianites and carry out the vengeance the LORD in Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A thousand out of every tribe throughout all the tribes of Israel shall ye send to the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel a thousand of [every] tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses sent them to the war; he sent a thousand of every tribe; and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, [went] to the war with the holy instruments, with the trumpets to blow in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they fought against the Midianites as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they also slew the kings of Midian among the rest of those that were slain: [namely], Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, five kings of Midian; they also slew Balaam, the son of Beor, with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Israel took [all] the women of Midian captives and their little ones and took the spoil of all their beasts and all their flocks and all their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they burnt all their cities in which they dwelt and all their palaces with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they took all the spoil and all the prey, [both] of men and of beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto Moses and Eleazar, the priest, and unto the congregation of the sons of Israel, unto the camp in the plains of Moab, which [was] by Jordan of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses was angry with the officers of the host, [with] the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds who returned from the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, these caused the sons of Israel through the counsel of Balaam to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor for which there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that has known a man by lying with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But all the female children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ye must abide outside the camp seven days; and whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any dead [body] ye shall remove the sin from them on the third and on the seventh day, [both] of yourselves and of your captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Likewise remove all sin from all [your] clothing and all that is made of skins and all work of goats' [hair] and every vessel made of wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Eleazar, the priest, said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This [is] the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>certainly the gold and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>every thing that may endure the fire, ye shall cause to pass through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless, ye shall remove the sin with the water of separation; and all that does not endure the fire ye shall cause to go through the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye shall also wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterwards ye shall come into the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Take the sum of the prey that was taken, [both] of man and of beast, thou and Eleazar, the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the congregation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and divide the prey into two parts between those that took the part in the war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And offer a tribute unto the LORD from the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons and of the oxen and of the asses and of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take [it] from their half and give Eleazar, the priest, the offering of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And of the half belonging to the sons of Israel, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of animals and give them unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, did as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the prey, [that is] the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and seventy-two thousand oxen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and sixty-one thousand asses</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known a man by lying with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the half [which was] the portion of those that went out to war was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the tribute for the LORD, of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the oxen [were] thirty-six thousand, of which the tribute for the LORD [was] seventy-two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the asses [were] thirty thousand five hundred, of which the tribute for the LORD [was] sixty-one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the persons [were] sixteen thousand, of which the tribute for the LORD [was] thirty-two persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Moses gave the tribute, [which was] the LORD'S [heave] offering, unto Eleazar, the priest, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And of the half pertaining to the sons of Israel, which Moses divided from the men that had gone to war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>(now the half [that pertained unto] the congregation was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and thirty-six thousand oxen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and thirty thousand five hundred asses</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and sixteen thousand persons)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>of the half, therefore of the sons of Israel, Moses took one portion of fifty, [both] of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the officers who [were] over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who [are] under our charge and not one man of us is missing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>We have therefore brought an offering for the LORD, each man of what he has found, of vessels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to reconcile our souls before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, took the gold from them, all wrought vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds, [was] sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>([For] the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of the testimony, [for] a memorial of the sons of Israel before the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
