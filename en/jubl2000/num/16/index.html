We will not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Moses was very angry and said unto the LORD, Look not thou upon their offering; I have not taken so much as one ass from them, neither have I done evil to any of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou and they and Aaron, tomorrow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and let each man take his censer and put incense in them and let each man bring his censer before the LORD, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also and Aaron, each [of you] with his censer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And each man took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense in them and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the testimony with Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Korah had gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony; then the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, and I will consume them in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they fell upon their faces and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Speak unto the congregation, saying, Separate yourselves now from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest peradventure ye be consumed in all their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they removed themselves from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, with their wives and their sons and their little children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, for [I have] not [done them out] of my own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If these men die the common death of all men or if they are visited after the visitation of all men, [then] the LORD has not sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if the LORD does a new thing and the earth opens her mouth and swallows them up with all their things and they go down alive into Sheol, then ye shall know that these men have provoked the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground broke open under them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their houses and all the men of Korah and all [their] goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They and all that they had went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And all Israel, those that [were] round about them, fled at the cry of them, for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up [also].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder, for</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the censers of these sinners are sanctified against their own souls, and broad plates shall be made of them [for] a covering of the altar, for they offered with them before the LORD; therefore, they are sanctified, and they shall be a sign unto the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Eleazar, the priest, took the brass censers with which those that were burnt had offered, and they were made into a broad covering of the altar</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>[to be] a memorial unto the sons of Israel, that no stranger who [is] not of the seed of Aaron come near to offer incense before the LORD, that he not be as Korah and as his company, as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the testimony; and, behold, the cloud had covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Depart from among this congregation, and I will consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take the censer and put fire in it from off the altar and put incense upon it and go quickly unto the congregation and reconcile them; for the wrath has gone out from before the face of the LORD; the plague is begun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then Aaron took [his censer] as Moses said and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people; and he put on incense and reconciled the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now those that died in that plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those that died concerning the matter of Korah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, [when] the plague was stayed.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
