It [is] not a place to [plant] seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates; there [is] not even any water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the congregation unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of the LORD appeared upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take the rod and gather the congregation together, thou and Aaron, thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, and it shall give forth its water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Moses took the rod from before the LORD as he commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice; and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts [also].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore, ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These [are] the waters of Meribah; over which the sons of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses sent ambassadors from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that has befallen us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we were in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and we cried unto the LORD, who heard our voice, and sent an angel and has brought us forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we [are] in Kadesh, a city on the edge of thy border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards, neither will we drink [of] the water of the wells; we will go by the king's [high] way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Edom replied unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me lest I come out against thee with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sons of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it; I will only, without [doing] anything [else], go through on my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Thou shalt not go through.
