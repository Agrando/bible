Have I begotten them, that thou should say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nurse carries a sucking child, unto the land which thou hast sworn unto their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where should I find flesh to give unto all these people? For they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all these people alone because [it] is too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if thou [must] deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found grace in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be elders of the people, and their princes; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the testimony that they may stand there with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and talk with thee there, and I will take of the spirit which [is] in thee and will put [it] upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear [it] not thyself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But thou shalt say unto the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh, for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for [it was] better with us in Egypt. Therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[But] even a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and it becomes loathsome unto you, because ye have despised the LORD who [is] among you and have wept before him, saying, Why have we come forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses said, The people, among whom I [am], are six hundred thousand footmen, and thou hast said, I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall sheep and oxen be slain for them, to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? Thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke unto him and took of the spirit that [was] in him and gave [it] unto the seventy elders, and it came to pass [that] when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied and did not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But there remained two [of the] men in the camp, the name of the one [was] Eldad and the name of the other Medad, upon whom the spirit also rested; and they [were] of those that were written, but they had not gone unto the tabernacle; and they began to prophesy in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, [one] of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? It would [be good] that all the LORD'S people were prophets [and] that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And there went forth a wind from the LORD and brought quail from the sea and left them upon the camp, a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp and almost two cubits [high] upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the people stood up all that day and all [that] night and all the next day, and they gathered the quail; he that gathered least gathered ten heaps, and they spread [them] all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the flesh [was] yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>From Kibrothhattaavah he moved the people unto Hazeroth, and they abode at Hazeroth.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
