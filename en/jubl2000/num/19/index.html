her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he cause to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast [it] into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Likewise he that burns her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a man [that is] clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay [them] up outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for the water of separation; it is sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he that gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; and it shall be unto the sons of Israel and unto the stranger that sojourns among them for a perpetual statute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that touches the dead body of any human person shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall remove the sin from themselves with that [water] on the third day, and on the seventh day they shall be clean; but if they do not remove the sin from themselves the third day, then the seventh day they shall not be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whoever touches the dead body of anyone that is dead and does not remove the sin has defiled the tabernacle of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean, and his uncleanness shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This [is] the law when anyone dies in a tent; all that come into the tent and all that [are] in the tent shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And every open vessel which has no lid fastened upon it [shall be] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And whoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And for the unclean [person] they shall take of the dust of the heifer [that was] burnt as sin and put living water over it in a vessel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip [it] in the water and sprinkle [it] upon the tent and upon all the stuff and upon the persons that were there and upon the one that touched the bone or the one slain or the one dead or the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the clean [person] shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and when he has removed the sin from them the seventh day, he shall then wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean in the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the man that shall be unclean and shall not cause the sin to be removed from himself, that person shall be cut off from among the congregation because he has defiled the tabernacle of the LORD; the water of separation has not been sprinkled upon him; he [is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, [also] he that sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that touches the water of separation shall be unclean until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever the unclean [person] touches shall be unclean; and the person that touches [it] shall be unclean until evening.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
