Would it not [be] better for us to return into Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, [who were] of those that had spied out the land, rent their clothes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and they spoke unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceeding good land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the LORD delights in us, then he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, do not be rebels against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land, for they are our bread; their defence is departed from them, and the LORD [is] with us; do not fear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then all the multitude spoke of stoning them with stones. But the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the testimony before all the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? How long will it be before they believe me, with all the signs which I have done among them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear [it], for thou didst bring this people out of the midst of them with thy might;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the inhabitants of this land will say, [for] they have already heard that thou, oh LORD, [wast] among this people, that thou, O LORD, art seen face to face, and [that] thy cloud was over them, and [that] thou didst go before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and that thou hast caused [all] this people to die as one man; and the Gentiles who have heard [of] thy fame will speak, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them; therefore, he has slain them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The LORD [is] longsuffering and of great mercy, letting go of iniquity and transgression and absolving, but by no means absolving [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons unto the third and fourth [generations].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pardon now the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But [as] truly [as] I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because all those men who saw my glory and my signs which I have done in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[surely] they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of those that provoked me see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But my servant Caleb, because there was another spirit in him, and he proved to follow after me, [I] will bring him into the land that he entered into, and his seed shall receive it by inheritance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and even the Amalekite and the Canaanite who dwell in the valley. Turn around tomorrow and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How long shall I hear this evil congregation, which murmurs against me, the complaints of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say unto them, [As truly as] I live, saith the LORD, according as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>[doubtless] ye shall not come into the land, [concerning] which I swore to make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But your little ones, whom ye said should be a prey, I will bring them in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But [as for] you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And your children shall be shepherded in the wilderness forty years and bear your fornications until your carcasses are wasted in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, [even] forty days, each day for a year, ye shall bear your iniquities forty years, and ye shall know my reason [for annulling my promise].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I, the LORD, have spoken, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me; in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the men, whom Moses had sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>even those men that brought an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of the men that went to spy out the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Moses told these things unto all the sons of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they rose up early in the morning and climbed up into the top of the mountain, saying, Here we are [prepared] to go up unto the place of which the LORD has spoken; for we have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Moses said, Why do ye break the commandment of the LORD? This also shall not prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Do not go up, for the LORD [is] not among you; do be not smitten before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the Amalekite and the Canaanite [are] there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye are turned away from following the LORD, therefore, the LORD will not be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But they presumed to go up unto the hill top; nevertheless, the ark of the covenant of the LORD and Moses, did not depart out of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the Amalekite came down and the Canaanite who dwelt in that hill and smote them and defeated them, [pursuing them] unto Hormah.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
