as the offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye offer it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Of the firstfruits of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an offering in your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when ye err and do not observe all these commandments which the LORD has spoken unto Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[even] all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded [Moses] and from then on, for your ages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then it shall be, if [the sin] was committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock as a burnt offering, for an acceptable savour unto the LORD with its present and its drink offering, according to the law, and one he goat as [the] sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the priest shall reconcile all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it [is] ignorance;

and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has made void his commandment, that person shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity [shall be] upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered firewood upon the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those that found him gathering firewood brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Speak unto the sons of Israel and bid them that they make for themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the LORD and do them and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, [seeking] after which ye fornicate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I [am] the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I AM your God.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
