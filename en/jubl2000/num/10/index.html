of beaten work shalt thou make them that thou may use them for the convocation of the congregation and for the moving of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall join themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when they blow [only] one, then the princes, [who are] heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When ye blow an alarm, then ye shall move the camp of those that are lodged towards the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when ye blow an alarm the second time, then ye shall move the camp of those that are lodged on the side of the Negev;

and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace, that they may be to you for a memorial before your God; I AM your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass on the twentieth [day] of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sons of Israel moved out of the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they moved the first time according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the first [place] went the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah according to their armies, and over his host [was] Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar [was] Nethaneel, the son of Zuar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun [was] Eliab, the son of Helon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the tabernacle was already taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies, and over his host [was] Elizur, the son of Shedeur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon [was] Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad [was] Eliasaph, the son of Deuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary, and while they were coming, [the others] set up the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After them the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set forward according to their armies, and over his host [was] Elishama, the son of Ammihud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh [was] Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin [was] Abidan, the son of Gideoni.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan set forward according to their armies, gathering together all the camps, and over his host [was] Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher [was] Pagiel, the son of Ocran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira, the son of Enan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus [were] the journeyings of the sons of Israel according to their armies when they set forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it to you.
