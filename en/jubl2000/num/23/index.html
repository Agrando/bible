And thus he went alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God met Balaam; and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon [each] altar a bullock and a ram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned unto him, and, behold, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took up his parable and said, Balak, the king of Moab, has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, [saying], Come, curse me Jacob and come, denounce Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why should I curse one whom God has not cursed? And why should I denounce one whom the LORD has not denounced?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For from the top of the rocks I have seen him, and from the hills I beheld him; behold, a people that shall dwell in confidence and shall not be counted among the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who shall count the dust of Jacob and the number of the fourth [part] of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed [them] altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD has put in my mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from which thou may see them; thou hast seen but the utmost part of them and hast not seen them all; and from there thou shalt curse them for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he brought him into the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on [every] altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet [the] LORD yonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said unto him, Go again unto Balak and say thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came unto him, and behold, he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What has the LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he took up his parable and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent; he said and shall he not do [it]? He spoke and shall he not execute it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, I have received blessing; and he has blessed; and I cannot reverse it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen rebellion in Israel; the LORD his God [is] with him, and the battle-cry of a king [is] in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>God brought them out of Egypt; he has, as it were the strength of a unicorn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because there is no enchantment in Jacob, neither [is there] any divination in Israel. According to this time, it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What God has made!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold the people, who shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion; he shall not lie down until he eats [of] the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Balak said unto Balaam, Now that you do not curse them, do not bless them either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Balaam said unto Balak, Did I not tell thee that all that the LORD says unto me, that I must do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou may curse them for me from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looks toward Jeshimon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Balak did as Balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on [every] altar.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
