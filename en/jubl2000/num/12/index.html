Has he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>(Now the man Moses [was] very meek, above all the men which [were] upon the face of the earth.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the LORD spoke suddenly unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the testimony. And they three came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood [in] the door of the tabernacle and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision [and] will speak unto him in dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My servant Moses is not so, who [is] faithful in all my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>With him I will speak mouth to mouth and by sight not by enigmas; he shall see the similitude of the LORD.

Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in [again].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days, and the people did not journey until Miriam was brought in [again].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And afterward he moved the people from Hazeroth, and they pitched camp in the wilderness of Paran.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
