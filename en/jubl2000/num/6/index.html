they shall be holy [and] shall let the locks of the hair of their head grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All the days that they separate [themselves] unto the LORD they shall come in unto no dead body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They shall not make themselves unclean for their father or for their mother, for their brother or for their sister, when they die because the consecration of their God [is] upon their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the days of their Nazariteship they [are] holy unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if anyone dies very suddenly beside them, and they have defiled the head of their Nazariteship, then they shall shave their head in the day of their cleansing; on the seventh day shall they shave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the eighth day they shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the priest shall offer the one as the sin and the other as a burnt offering and reconcile the one that sinned upon the dead and shall sanctify their head that same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of their Nazariteship and shall bring a lamb of the first year for their guilt;
