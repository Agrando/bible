His mother's name [was] Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless for David's sake, the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because David had done [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD and had not turned aside from any [thing] that he had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah, the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
