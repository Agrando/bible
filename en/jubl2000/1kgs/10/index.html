Thy wisdom and good exceeds the fame which I heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed [are] thy men, blessed [are] these thy servants, who stand continually before thee [and] that hear thy wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel; because the LORD has always loved Israel, therefore he made thee king, to do justice and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great store of spices and precious stones; never [again] did there come such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the navy of Hiram, that had brought the gold from Ophir, also brought in from Ophir a great plenty of brazil wood and precious stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king made of the brazil wood banisters for the house of the LORD and for the king's houses, harps also and psalteries for the singers; there never had been such brazil wood, nor was it seen [again] unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And King Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, beside [that] which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>besides [what he had] from the merchantmen and from the trade of the spice merchants and from all the kings of Arabia and from the princes of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And King Solomon made two hundred shields [of] beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of gold went into each shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Likewise [he made] three hundred shields [of] beaten gold; three pounds of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The king also made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the purest gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne [was] round behind, and [there were] stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any other kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all King Solomon's drinking vessels [were of] gold, and likewise all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; [there was] no silver, for in the days of Solomon it was not esteemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram; once every three years the navy of Tarshish came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the earth sought to see the face of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they each one brought his presents each year, vessels of gold and vessels of silver and garments and arms and spices, horses, and mules.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he put in the cities of the chariots and with the king at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the king made silver [to be] in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars [to be] as the sycamore trees that [are] in the vale, for abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt and linen yarn, for the king's merchants bought the horses and yarn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty, and so by their hand they supplied all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
