And the messengers departed and brought him word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Benhadad sent unto him again and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, that the dust of Samaria shall not be enough for the [open] hands of all the people that follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell [him], Let not him that girds on [his harness] boast as he that puts it off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he heard this word, as he [was] drinking with the kings in the pavilions, he said unto his servants, Set [yourselves in array]. And they set [themselves in array] against the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab, king of Israel, saying, Thus hath the LORD said, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into thy hand today, that thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus hath the LORD said, [Even] by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he numbered all the people, [even] all the sons of Israel, [being] seven thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they went out at noon. But Benhadad [was] drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings that helped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first. And Benhadad had sent out men who warned him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he said, If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army followed after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And each one smote the man that came against him; and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them. And Benhadad, the king of Syria, escaped on a horse with some of the horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king of Israel went out and smote the horsemen and the chariots and smote the Syrians with a great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and consider, and see what thou must do, for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods [are] gods of the mountains; therefore, they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, do this: Remove the kings from their positions and put captains in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And prepare another army like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot; then we will fight against them in the plain, [and] surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the sons of Israel were numbered and took provisions and went against them; and the sons of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[Then] the man of God came and spoke unto the king of Israel and said, Thus hath the LORD said, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD [is] God of the mountains, but he [is] not God of the valleys, therefore, I will deliver all this great multitude into thy hand that ye may know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And [so] it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the sons of Israel slew of the Syrians one hundred thousand footmen in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the rest fled to Aphek into the city, and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand of the men [that were] left. And Benhadad also fled and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel [are] merciful kings; let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he will give thee thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they girded sackcloth on their loins and [put] ropes on their heads and came to the king of Israel and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he replied, If he is yet alive, he [is] my brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now these men took this as a good omen and quickly took this word from his mouth, and they said, Thy brother Benhadad! And he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him, and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And [Benhadad] said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make plazas for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria, and I will leave here confederated with thee. So he made a covenant with him and sent him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour by the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall smite thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him and smote him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he found another man and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him and wounded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with a veil over his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king, and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said, Guard this man; if by any means he should get away, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when thy servant was busy here and there, he disappeared. Then the king of Israel said unto him, So [shall] thy sentence [be]; thou thyself hast decided [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he quickly took the veil away from his face; and the king of Israel recognized that he [was] of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said unto him, Thus hath the LORD said, Because thou hast let go out of [thy] hand the man of my anathema, therefore, thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the king of Israel went to his house, sad and angry, and came to Samaria.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
