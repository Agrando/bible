And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman [was] there gathering of sticks; and he called to her and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as she was going to fetch [it], he called to her again and said, Bring me also, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she said, As the LORD thy God lives, I have no baked bread, but only a handful of meal in a pitcher and a little oil in a cruse; and now I [was] gathering two sticks that I may go in and prepare it for me and my son, that we may eat it and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; [go and] do as thou hast said; but first make me a little cake of bread baked under the ashes and bring [it] unto me, and afterwards thou shalt make for thee and for thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thus hath said the LORD God of Israel, The pitcher of meal shall not be consumed, neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the that day when the LORD shall send rain upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she went and did as Elijah told her; and he and she and her house ate [for many] days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[And] the pitcher of meal was not consumed, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD which he spoke by Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass after these things [that] the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? Art thou come unto me to call my iniquity to remembrance and to cause my son to die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into the chamber where he abode and laid him upon his own bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he cried unto the LORD and said, O LORD my God, hast thou even brought evil upon the widow, with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the LORD and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother, and Elijah said, See, thy son lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou [art] a man of God [and] that the word of the LORD [is] true in thy mouth.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
