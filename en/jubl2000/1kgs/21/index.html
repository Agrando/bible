And he lay down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad that thou dost eat no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto her, Because I spoke with Naboth of Jezreel and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee [another] vineyard for it; and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jezebel, his wife, said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise [and] eat bread and let thy heart be merry; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed [them] with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that [were] in his city dwelling with Naboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And [then] carry him out and stone him that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of his city, [even] the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them [and] as it [was] written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the two men, sons of Belial, came in and sat before him; and those men of Belial witnessed against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead that she said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel which he refused to give thee for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel, to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah, the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, go down to meet Ahab, king of Israel, who [is] in Samaria; behold, [he is] in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus hath the LORD said, Hast thou murdered and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him again, saying, Thus hath the LORD said, In the same place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall the dogs also lick thy blood, even thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found [thee] because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee and will burn away thy posterity and will cut off from Ahab him that pisses against the wall and he that is kept and he that is left in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked [me] to anger and made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of Jezebel, the LORD has also spoken, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Him that dies of Ahab in the city, the dogs shall eat, and him that dies in the field, shall the fowls of the air eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(Truly there was none like unto Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife incited him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He was very abominable, following idols, according to all the [things] that the Amorites did, whom the LORD cast out before the sons of Israel.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and slept in sackcloth and went softly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah, the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Seest thou how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days, [but] in his son's days I will bring the evil upon his house.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
