Solomon also made a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken [to wife], like unto this porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All these [works were of] costly stones, cut and sawed with saws according to the measurements, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and [so] on the outside unto the great court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the foundation [was of] costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And above [were also] costly stones, hewed according to their measurements, and work of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the great court round about had three orders of hewed stones and an order of cedar beams, and [likewise] the inner court of the house of the LORD and the porch of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father had been of Tyre. A worker in brass, full of wisdom and intelligence and knowledge in all work of brass. And he came to King Solomon and did all his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He made two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece, and a line of twelve cubits did compass each of them about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he made two chapiters [of] molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one chapiter [was] five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter [was] five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[And] nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which [were to be placed] upon the top of the pillars, seven for the one chapiter and seven for the other chapiter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had made the pillars, he also made two orders [of pomegranates] round about upon the network to cover the chapiters that [were] upon the heads [of the pillars] with the pomegranates, and so did he for the other chapiter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chapiters that [were] upon the top of the pillars were in the form of lilies [like those seen] in the porch, for four cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the chapiters upon the two pillars had two hundred pomegranates in two orders round about in each chapiter, on top of the belly of the chapiter, this belly being in front of the network.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he stood up the pillars in the porch of the temple. And when he had set up the right pillar, he called the name of it Jachin; and in standing up the left pillar, he called its name Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And upon the top of the pillars [was] lily work, and so the work of the pillars was finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Likewise, he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other; [it was] perfectly round, and its height [was] five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And under the brim of it round about [there were] knops like gourds compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about in two orders, which were made when it was cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the Negev and three looking toward the east; and upon them the sea rested, and all their hinder parts [were] inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it [was] a hand breadth thick, and its lip was made like the lip of a cup, with flowers of lilies; it contained two thousand baths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He also made ten bases of brass; four cubits [was] the length of each base and four cubits the width and three cubits the height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the work of the bases was like this: they had borders, and the borders [were] between mouldings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and upon the borders that [were] between the mouldings [were] lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the mouldings of the base, above and beneath the lions and oxen [were] certain additions made of bevelled work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And each base had four brasen wheels and cardinals of brass, and in its four corners it had shoulderpieces, which were molten at the side of each addition, to be under the laver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Its mouth entered into the chapiter ([in the joint that came out of the base]) one cubit above, and its mouth was rounded like the workmanship ([of the same joint]) in the base, of a cubit and a half. There were also engravings upon the mouth of it with their borders, which were square, not round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And under the borders [were] the four wheels, and the axletrees of the wheels [came forth] from the same base. The height of each wheel [was] one and a half cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the workmanship of the wheels [was] like the workmanship of a chariot wheel, their axletrees and their rims and their spokes and their hubs [were] all molten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Likewise, the four shoulderpieces to the four corners of each base, [and] the shoulderpieces [were] of the very base itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the top of the base [there was] a rounded compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base, its mouldings and borders [which were] part of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For on the tables of the mouldings and on the borders thereof, he made cherubim, lions, and palm trees, in front of the additions of each one round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this [manner] he made ten bases cast in the same manner, of the same size and of the same shape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he also made ten lavers of brass; each laver contained forty baths, [and] each laver measured four cubits; [and he set] a laver upon each one of the ten bases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house, and he set the sea on the right side of the house to the east towards the Negev.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basins likewise. So Hiram finished all the work that he made King Solomon for the house of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>[That is], the two pillars and the [two] bowls of the chapiters that [were] on the top of the two pillars and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which [were] upon the head of the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, [even] two orders of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that [were] upon the heads of the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and the ten bases and ten lavers upon the bases,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and one sea and twelve oxen under the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and the pots and the shovels and the basins and all the [other] vessels, which Hiram made to King Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the king caused them all to be cast in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Solomon did not inquire the weight of the brass of all the vessels because they were exceeding many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Solomon made all the vessels that [pertained] unto the house of the LORD: an altar of gold, and a table upon which the showbread [was], also of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right hand, and five on the left, in front of the oracle, with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs [of] gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>likewise the bowls and the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and the censers [of] pure gold, also the hinges of gold, [both] for the doors of the inner house, the holy of holies, [and] for the doors of the house of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So all the work that King Solomon made for the house of the LORD was complete. And Solomon brought in the things which David, his father, had dedicated, [even] the silver and the gold and the vessels, and he kept it [all] in the treasury of the house of the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
