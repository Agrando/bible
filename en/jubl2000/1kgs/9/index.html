I have sanctified this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if thou wilt walk before me as David, thy father, walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, keeping my statutes and my rights,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever as I spoke unto David, thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[But] if ye shall obstinately turn from following me, ye or your sons, and will not keep my commandments [and] my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them, and this house, which I have sanctified unto my name, I will cast out of my sight, and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and at this house, [which] was high, any one that passes by it shall be astonished and shall hiss, and they shall say, Why has the LORD done thus unto this land and to this house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them; for this the LORD has brought upon them all this evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(for which Hiram, the king of Tyre, had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold, according to all his desire), that then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, What cities [are] these which thou hast given me, my brother?
