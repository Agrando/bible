Why then does Adonijah reign?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I also will come in after thee and finish thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber; and the king was very old; and Abishag, the Shunammite, ministered unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Bathsheba bowed and worshipped the king. And the king said, What dost thou desire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said unto him, My lord, thou didst sware by the LORD thy God unto thy handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, thou dost not know [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and has called all the sons of the king and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the captain of the host; but he has not invited Solomon, thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel [are] upon thee that thou should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Otherwise, it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that I and my son Solomon shall be counted as sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while she yet spoke with the king, Nathan, the prophet, also came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan, the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For today he has gone down and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and has called all the king's sons and the captains of the host and Abiathar, the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him and say, [Long] live King Adonijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he did not invite me, thy servant, nor Zadok, the priest, nor Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, nor thy servant Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not declared unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then King David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence and stood before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king swore and said, As the LORD lives, who has ransomed my soul out of all distress,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>even as I swore unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Bathsheba bowed with [her] face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said, Let my lord King David live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And King David said, Call me Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. And they entered into the presence of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule and bring him down to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And let Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him there king over Israel; and ye shall blow the shofar and say, [Long] live king Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>[Afterward] ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne, for he shall reign in my stead, for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answered the king and said, Amen. Let the LORD God of my lord the king say so [too].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so let him be with Solomon and let him make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and caused Solomon to ride upon King David's mule and brought him to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Zadok, the priest, took the horn of the oil of the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew the shofar, and all the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>[Afterward] all the people came up following him, and the people sang with flutes and rejoiced with great joy so [that it seemed] the earth rent with the sound of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Adonijah and all the guests that [were] with him heard [it] when they had finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the shofar, he said, Why [is this] noise of the city being in an uproar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, the priest, came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in, for thou [art] a valiant man and bringest good tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord King David has made Solomon king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This [is] the noise that ye have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And also Solomon has been seated on the throne of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And moreover, the king's servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king worshipped upon the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And also thus said the king, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who has given [one] to sit on my throne today, mine eyes even seeing [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all the guests that [were] with Adonijah were afraid and rose up and went each one his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Adonijah, fearing the presence of Solomon, arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, for he has caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Solomon said, If he will show himself virtuous, there shall not one hair of him fall to the ground, but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to King Solomon. And Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
