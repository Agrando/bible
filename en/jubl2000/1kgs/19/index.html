And he ate and drank and went back to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel of the LORD came again the second time and touched him and said, Arise [and] eat, for there is a great journey before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb, the mount of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there he went into a cave, where he lodged; and the word of the LORD [came] to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he replied, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of the hosts, for the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, [even] I only, am left, and they seek me to take my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, Go forth and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, [but] the LORD [was] not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, [but] the LORD [was] not in the earthquake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after the earthquake a fire, [but] the LORD [was] not in the fire. And after the fire, a still small voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Which when Elijah heard [it], he covered his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the door of the cave. And, behold, [there came] a voice unto him, saying, What doest thou here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he replied, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of the hosts because the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, [even] I only, am left, and they seek me to take my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way by the wilderness of Damascus; and thou shalt arrive [there] and anoint Hazael [to be] king over Syria;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Jehu, the son of Nimshi, thou shalt anoint [to be] king over Israel; and Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah, thou shalt anoint [to be] prophet in thy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall be [that] he that escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall slay; and he that escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall slay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will cause seven thousand to remain in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he departed from there and found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who [was] plowing [with] twelve yoke [of oxen] before him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and [then] I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again, for what have I done to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and served him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
