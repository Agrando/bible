But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for thou [art] a wise man and knowest what thou should do with him, but thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The days that David reigned over Israel [were] forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was established greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said moreover, I have a word to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and [that] all Israel had set their faces on me that I should reign, but the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for by the LORD it was his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now I ask one petition of thee, do not deny me. And she said unto him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not deny thee) that he give me Abishag, the Shunammite to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Bathsheba, therefore, went unto King Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; [I pray thee], do not deny me. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, Let Abishag, the Shunammite, be given to Adonijah, thy brother, to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And King Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag, the Shunammite, for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he [is] my elder brother and he also has Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Zeruiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, therefore, [as] the LORD lives, who has confirmed me, and set me on the throne of David, my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And unto Abiathar, the priest, the king said, Go to Anathoth, unto thine own inheritance, for thou [art] worthy of death; but I will not put thee to death today because thou didst bare the ark of the Lord GOD before David, my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he had not turned after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it was told King Solomon that Joab had fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD and that he was by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Benaiah entered into the tabernacle of the LORD and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king said unto him, Do as he has said and fall upon him and bury him that thou may take away from me and from the house of my father the blood which Joab shed without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword without my father David knowing of it: Abner, the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their blood shall, therefore, return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but upon David and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and fell upon him and slew him, and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the king put Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, in his place over the host; and Zadok, the priest, the king put in the place of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[Afterward] the king sent and called for Shimei and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go forth from there anywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For it shall be [that] on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Shimei said unto the king, The word [is] good as my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants [are] in Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went, therefore, and brought his servants from Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it was told Solomon how Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then the king sent and called for Shimei and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD and protested unto thee, saying, Know for certain, on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad anywhere that thou shalt surely die? And thou didst say unto me, The word [that] I have heard [is] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart knoweth well that thou didst to David my father; therefore, the LORD has turned thy wickedness upon thine own head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and King Solomon [shall be] blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then the king commanded Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who went out and fell upon him that he died. And the kingdom was confirmed in the hand of Solomon.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
