And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The altar also was rent, and the [ashes with the burnt] fat were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again and became as [it was] before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their father said unto them, What way did he go? And his sons showed him the way the man of God had gone, who had come from Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass, and he rode thereon</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, [Art] thou the man of God that didst come from Judah? And he said, I [am].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said unto him, Come home with me and eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I may not return with thee nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the [other] said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou [art], and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. [But] he lied unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus hath the LORD said, Forasmuch as thou hast rebelled against the mouth of the LORD and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but didst come back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of which [the LORD] did say to thee, Eat no bread and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he had eaten of the bread and after he had drunk, the prophet that had brought him back saddled an ass for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and as he went, a lion met him by the way and slew him, and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, and the lion also stood by the carcase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, behold, men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase; and they came and told [it] in the city where the old prophet dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the prophet that had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It [is] the man of God, who rebelled against the word of the LORD; therefore, the LORD has delivered him unto the lion, who has torn him and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me an ass. And they saddled it for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase; the lion had not eaten the carcase nor torn the ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God and laid it upon the ass and brought it back. And the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he laid his carcase in his own grave, and they mourned over him, [saying], Alas, my brother!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre in which the man of God [is] buried; lay my bones beside his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For that which he proclaimed by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places, which [are] in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After this thing Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places; whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became [one] of the priests of the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this became the cause of sin unto the house of Jeroboam for which it was cut off and destroyed from off the face of the earth.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
