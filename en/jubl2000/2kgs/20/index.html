And the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, came to him and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I beseech thee, O LORD, remember how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done [that which is] good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept with great weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And before Isaiah had gone out into the middle of the court, the word of the LORD came to him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Turn again and tell Hezekiah, prince of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David, thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will add unto thy days fifteen years, and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid [it] on the boil, and he recovered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hezekiah had said unto Isaiah, What [shall be] the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Hezekiah answered, It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees, but not for the shadow to return backward ten degrees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Isaiah, the prophet, cried unto the LORD, and he caused the shadow to return by the degrees by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and presents unto Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hezekiah hearkened unto them and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and [all] the house of his weapons and all that was found in his treasury; there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Isaiah, the prophet, came unto King Hezekiah and said unto him, What did these men say, and where did they come from unto thee? And Hezekiah replied, They are come from a far country, [even] from Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All [the things] that [are] in my house they have seen; there is nothing among my treasury that I have not showed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, the days come that all that [is] in thy house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, they shall take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, The word of the LORD which thou hast spoken is good. And he said, For shall there not be peace and truth in my days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought water into the city, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh, his son reigned in his stead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
