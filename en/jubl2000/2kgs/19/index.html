Has he laughed thee to scorn, O virgin daughter of Zion? He has moved his head behind thy back, O daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? Against the Holy [One] of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By the hand of thy messengers, thou hast reproached the Lord and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof [and] the choice fir trees thereof; and I will enter into the habitation of his borders [and into] the forest of his Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have dug and drunk the waters of others, and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the rivers of defended places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hast thou never heard that from a long time [ago] I made her, [and] from ancient times I have formed her? Now I have made her come, and it shall be to lay waste fenced cities [into] ruinous heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore their inhabitants' hands were too short; dismayed and confounded, they shall be [as] the grass of the field and [as] the green herb, [as] the hay on the housetops, that is dried up before it comes to maturity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because thou hast raged against me and thy tumult has come up into my ears, therefore, I will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou didst come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this [shall be] a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year such things as grow [again] of themselves; and in the third year ye shall sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And that which has escaped, that which is left of the house of Judah, shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and deliverance out of Mount Zion; the zeal of the LORD of the hosts shall do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shield nor cast a bank against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not enter into this city, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake and for my servant David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass that night that the angel of the LORD went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand [men]; and when they arose early in the morning, behold, the corpses of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, departed and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch, his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, smote him with the sword and fled into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his stead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
