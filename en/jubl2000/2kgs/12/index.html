And his mother's name [was] Zibiah of Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jehoash did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD all the time that Jehoiada, the priest, instructed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But with all this, the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the sanctified things that is brought into the house of the LORD, the money of the [redemptions of] each one that passes [the account], the money of each soul according to the estimation of each one, [and] all the money that comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>let the priests receive it, each man of his kinsmen; and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it was so [that], in the year twenty-three of King Jehoash, the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada, the priest, and the [other] priests and said unto them, Why do ye not repair the breaches of the house? Now, therefore, receive no [more] money of your kinsmen, but deliver it to repair the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the priests consented to receive no [more] money from the people, neither to be responsible to repair the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jehoiada, the priest, took an ark and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar, on the right side of the entrance to the house of the LORD; and the priests that kept the door put all the money [that was] brought into the house of the LORD in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they saw that there was much money in the ark, the king's scribe and the high priest came up and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD and guarded it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they gave sufficient money into the hands of those that did the work and of those that had the responsibility of the house of the LORD; and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that repaired the house of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and to the masons and hewers of stone and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD and for all that was laid out for the house to repair [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But of that money that was brought into the house of the LORD, they did not make bowls of silver nor snuffers nor basins nor trumpets nor any vessels of gold or vessels of silver for house of the LORD</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>because they gave it to the workmen and repaired the house of the LORD with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover they did not require accounts from the men into whose hands they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen, for they dealt faithfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The guilt money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD, for it was the priests'.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Hazael, king of Syria, went up, and fought against Gath and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated and his own holy things and all the gold [that was] found in the treasury of the house of the LORD and in the king's house and sent [it] to Hazael, king of Syria; and he went away from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And his servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew Joash in the house of Millo, as he was going down to Silla.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Jozachar, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; and Amaziah, his son, reigned in his stead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
