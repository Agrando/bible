And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he [also] took the letter to the king of Israel, which said, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have [therewith] sent Naaman, my servant, to thee, that thou may remove his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and said, [Am] I God, to kill and to give life, that this man sends unto me to remove the leprosy of this man? Therefore now consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, Why hast thou rent thy clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall be restored, and thou shalt be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Naaman went away angry and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD, his God, and strike his hand over the place and remove the leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>[Are] not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then his servants came near and spoke unto him, and said, My father, [if] the prophet had bid thee [do some] great thing, would thou not have done [it]? How much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash and be clean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him, and he said, Behold, now I know that [there is] no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing from thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take [it], but he refused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? For from now one thy servant will offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In this thing [may] the LORD pardon thy servant, [that] when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, if I also bow myself in the house of Rimmon, that the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing, if I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman, this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw [him] running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said, [Is] there no peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, Peace. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets came to me from Mount Ephraim; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver and two changes of garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Naaman said, If you wish take two talents. And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid [them] upon two of his servants; and they bore [them] before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he came to a secret place, he took [them] from their hand and bestowed [them] in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But [when] he went in and stood before his master, Elisha said unto him, From where [comest thou], Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went nowhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he said unto him, Did not my heart go [with thee] when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? [Is it] a time to receive money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
