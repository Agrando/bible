and they built forts against it round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And on the ninth of the month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the city was broken up, and all the men of war [fled] by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which is by the king's garden, with the Chaldees round about the city; and they went by the way of the plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, after all his army had been scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah, and they sentenced him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month, which [was] the year nineteen of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he burnt the house of the LORD and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great [man's] house he burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the army of the Chaldees, that [were with] the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now the rest of the people [that were] left in the city and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land [to be] vinedressers and husbandmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Chaldees broke in pieces the pillars of brass that [were] in the house of the LORD and the bases and the brasen sea that [was] in the house of the LORD and carried the brass of them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They also took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons and all the vessels of brass, with which they ministered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the censers and the bowls [and] such things as [were] of gold [in] gold and of silver [in] silver the captain of the guard took away, also</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The height of the one pillar [was] eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it [was] brass; and the height of the chapiter three cubits, and network and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass; and the second pillar was like [the first] with network.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three keepers of the door;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and out of the city he took a eunuch, that was set over the men of war, and five men of those that were in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land, with sixty men of the people of the land [that were] found in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king of Babylon smote and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And [as for] the people whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, left in the land of Judah, he made Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, [even] Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth, the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah, the son of Maachathi, they and their men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Gedaliah swore to them and to their men and said unto them, Do not fear the servants of the Chaldees; dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But in the seventh month, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama of the royal seed, came and ten men with him and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass after thirty-seven years of the captivity of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh [day] of the month, [that] Evilmerodach, king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, out of the prison house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he spoke kindly to him and set his seat above the seats of the kings that [were] with him in Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he changed his prison garments, and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king caused him to be given his food continually, each thing in its time, all the days of his life.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
