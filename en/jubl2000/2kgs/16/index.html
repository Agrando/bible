and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At that time Rezin, king of Syria, recovered Elath to Syria and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath and dwelt there unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser, king of Assyria, saying, I [am] thy servant and thy son; come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who have risen up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasury of the king's house and sent [it for] a bribe to the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him, for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it and carried [the people of] it captive to Kir and slew Rezin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser, King of Assyria, and saw the altar that [was] at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah, the priest, the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Urijah, the priest, built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus; so Urijah, the priest, made [it] while King Ahaz returned from Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king came near to the altar and offered upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he burnt his burnt offering and his present and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace [offerings], next to the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the brasen altar which [had been] before the LORD, he cause to be moved in front of the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and he put it beside the altar towards the Aquilon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And King Ahaz commanded Urijah, the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening present and the king's burnt sacrifice and his present, and likewise the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their present and their drink offerings, and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice; and the brasen altar shall be mine to enquire [by].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus did Urijah, the priest, according to all that King Ahaz commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And King Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the lavers from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that [were] under it and put it upon a pavement of stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the king's entry outside, he moved behind the house of the LORD, for the sake of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David;
