Then open the door and flee and do not tarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he came, behold, the captains of the host [were] sitting, and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him, Thus hath said the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, [even] over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab, thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisses against the wall, he that is shut up as well as he that is left in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and [there shall be] no one to bury [her]. And he opened the door and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord, and [one] said unto him, Is there peace? Why did this mad [fellow] come to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and his communication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said, We know not; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke unto me, saying, Thus hath the LORD said, I have anointed thee king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they hastened, and each man took his garment, and put [it] under him in a high throne, and blew the shofar, saying, Jehu is king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramothgilead, with all Israel, because of Hazael, king of Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But King Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael, king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your desire, [then] do not let anyone go forth [nor] escape out of the city to tell the news in Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jehu rode and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah, king of Judah, was come down to see Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the watchman, who stood in the tower of Jezreel, spied the company of Jehu as he came and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman and send to meet them and let him say unto them, Is there peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So one on horseback went to meet him and said, Thus saith the king, Is there peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? Turn behind me. And the watchman gave notice, saying, The messenger came to them, but he does not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he sent out another on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is there peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? Turn behind me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the watchman gave notice again, saying, He also came unto them and does not return, and the pace of him who is coming [is] like the pace of Jehu, the son of Nimshi, for he comes impetuously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram, king of Israel, and Ahaziah, king of Judah, went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the portion of Naboth of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, Is there peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the fornications of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts [are so] many?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Joram turned his hands and fled and said to Ahaziah, [There is] treachery, O Ahaziah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said [Jehu] to Bidkar, his captain, Take him [and] cast him in the edge of the portion of the field of Naboth of Jezreel. Remember that when thou and I went together after Ahab, his father, the LORD pronounced this sentence upon him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, said the LORD, and I will requite thee in this portion, said the LORD. Now, therefore, take [and] cast him into the portion, according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw [this], he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him and said, Smite him also in the chariot. [And they did so] at the ascent to Gur, which [is] by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo and died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And his servants carried him to Jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jehu came to Jezreel, and when Jezebel heard [of it], she painted her face and tired her head and looked out of a window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, [Had] Zimri peace, who slew his master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he lifted up his face to the window and said, Who [is] on my side? Who? And two [or] three eunuchs looked at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down, and [some] of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses; and he trode her under foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he entered in, and after he ate and drank, he said, Go, see now this cursed [woman] and bury her; for [after all] she [is] a king's daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of [her] hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they returned and told him. And he said, This [is] the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah, the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel so that no one shall be able to say, This [is] Jezebel.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
