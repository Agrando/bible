So Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this [is] the woman, and this [is] her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. Then the king appointed unto her a eunuch, saying, Restore all that [was] hers and all the fruits of the lands since the day that she left the lands, even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Elisha went to Damascus; and Benhadad, the king of Syria, was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad, king of Syria, has sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou may certainly recover. But the LORD has showed me that he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Hazael said unto him, Why does my lord weep? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the sons of Israel; their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hazael said, But what, [is] thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that thou [shalt be] king over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he departed from Elisha and came to his master; who said to him, What did Elisha say to thee? And he answered, He told me [that] thou may surely recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped [it] in water and spread [it] on his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat [being] then king of Judah, Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife, and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet with all this, the LORD would not destroy Judah for David, his servant's sake, as he had promised him to give him always a light of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In his days, Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah and made a king over themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Joram went over to Zair and all his chariots with him, and he rose up by night and smote the Edomites, who had compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled into their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the twelfth year of Joram, the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ahaziah [was] twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as [did] the house of Ahab; for he [was] the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went with Joram, the son of Ahab, to the war against Hazael, king of Syria, in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And King Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael, king of Syria. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Joram, the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
