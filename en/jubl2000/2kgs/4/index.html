Tell me what thou hast in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid has nothing in the house except a flask of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said, Go, borrow vessels from all thy neighbours, empty vessels; borrow not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then enter in and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and pour out into all those vessels, and as each one is full, set it aside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out [the oil].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the vessels were full, she said unto her son, Bring me yet [another] vessel. And he said unto her, [There are] no more vessels. Then the oil stopped [flowing].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell this oil and pay thy debtors and live thou and thy sons of the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it also happened that one day Elisha passed through Shunem, where [there was] an important woman, and she constrained him to eat bread. And [so] it was, [that] as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this [is] a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall, and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick so that when he comes to us, he shall turn in there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass one day that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and slept there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he said to Gehazi, his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said unto [Gehazi], Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been diligent for us with all this care; what shall I do for thee? Dost thou have need that I speak for thee unto the king or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, What then shall we do for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she has no child, and her husband is old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[Then] he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, At the appointed time, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, [thou] man of God, do not deceive thy handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the woman conceived and gave birth a son at appointed time that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the child was grown, it came to pass one day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a servant, Carry him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon and [then] died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut [the door] upon him and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And calling her husband, she said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Why must thou go to him today? [It is] neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, Peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then she caused the ass to be saddled and said to her servant, Lead and go forward; slack not the pace for me except I bid thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So she went and came unto the man of God to Mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi, his servant, Behold, [yonder is] that Shunammite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her and say unto her, Dost thou have peace? And thy husband? And the child? And she answered, Peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when she came to the man of God in the mountain, she caught him by the feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul [is] bitter within her; and the LORD has hid [it] from me and has not revealed it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go; if thou meet anyone, salute him not; and if anyone salutes thee, answer him not again, and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives and [as] thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And he arose and followed her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Gehazi had gone on before them and had laid the staff upon the face of the child, but [there was] neither voice, nor attention. Therefore he went again to meet him and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was laid dead upon his bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He went in therefore and shut the door upon both of them and prayed unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[Then] he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands; [thus] he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he returned and walked through the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him again; and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he called Gehazi and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And as she was coming in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then she entered in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Elisha returned to Gilgal. Then there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets [were] sitting before him, so he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot and make pottage for the sons of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered his lap full of wild grapes and came and shred [them] into the pot of pottage, for they knew [them] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of that pottage, that they cried out and said, O [thou] man of God, [there is] death in the pot. And they could not eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast [it] into the pot, and he said, Pour out for the people that they may eat. And there was no evil thing in the pot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then a man came from Baalshalisha, who brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of wheat in the head. And he said, Give unto the people that they may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And his minister said, How can I set this before one hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat, for thus hath the LORD said, They shall eat, and [some] shall be left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he set [it] before them, and they ate, and [some was] left over, according to the word of the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
