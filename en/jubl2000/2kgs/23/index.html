Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, and anointed him and made him king in his father's stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jehoahaz [was] twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name [was] Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Pharaohnechoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, as he was reigning in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim, the son of Josiah, king in the place of Josiah his father and changed his name to Jehoiakim and took Jehoahaz and carried him to Egypt, and he died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he caused the land to be valued to give [this] money according to the commandment of Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of each one according to the estimation of [his worth], to give [it] unto Pharaohnechoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jehoiakim [was] twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name [was] Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
