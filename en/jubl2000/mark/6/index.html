And they were offended at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not dishonoured except in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he could do no mighty work there except that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went through the villages round about, teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he called [unto him] the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power [over] the unclean spirits</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and commanded them that they should take nothing for [their] journey except a staff only: no provision bag, no bread, no money in [their] purse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but [be] shod with sandals and not put on two coats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said unto them, In whatever place ye enter into a house, there abide until ye depart from that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you, when ye depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet in testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went out and preached that men should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many that were sick, and they [were] healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And king Herod heard [of him] (for his name was spread abroad), and he said, John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and therefore virtues operate in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is [the] prophet or one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard [of it], he said, This is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him, but she could not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and respected him; and when he heard him, he did many things and heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his princes and tribunes and to the principal [people] of Galilee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and those that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give [it unto] thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he swore unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give [it unto] thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she came in with haste unto the king and asked, saying, I will that thou give me immediately in a platter the head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king was exceeding sorry, [yet] for his oath's sake and for the sakes of those who sat with him, he would not reject her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And straightway the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought, and he went and beheaded him in the prison</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought his head in a platter and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when his disciples heard [of it], they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus and told him everything they had done and what they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while; for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And many saw them departing and knew him and ran there afoot out of the cities and arrived before them and came together unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And [Jesus], when he came out, saw a great multitude and had mercy on them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him and said, This is a desert place, and now the time [is] far passed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said unto him, Shall we go and buy bread for two hundred denarius and give them to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves and gave [them] to his disciples to set before them, and the two fishes he divided among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they all ate and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And those that ate were five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And straightway he told his disciples to get quickly into the ship and to go to the other side before him unto Bethsaida while he dispatched the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when he had dispatched them, he departed into the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when night was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them; and about the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a ghost and cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For they all saw him and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them and said unto them, Be of good cheer; I AM; be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went up unto them into the ship, and the wind ceased; and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For they had not [yet] derived understanding in the loaves, for their hearts were blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wherever he entered, into villages or cities or fields, they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment, and as many as touched him were saved.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
