But they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand.

And those who dwell around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he had healed many, insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went up to the mountain and called unto himself whom he would, and they came unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he established twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon, whom he gave the name Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and James the [son] of Zebedee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed them Boanerges, which is The sons of thunder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the [son] of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus and Simon the Canaanite</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him; and they came home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when his [friends] and family heard [of it], they went out to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said that he had Beelzebub and that by the prince of the devils he cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he called them [unto him] and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If [a] kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if [a] house is divided against itself, that house cannot remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided, he cannot remain, but has an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man, and then he will spoil his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and whatever blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit shall never have forgiveness but is obligated to eternal judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The multitude was sitting all around him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brothers [and sisters] seek thee without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking round about on those who sat about him, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whosoever doeth the will of God, the same is my brother and my sister and my mother.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
