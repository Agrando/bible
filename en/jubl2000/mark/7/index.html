And there are many other things which they took upon themselves to hold [such as] the washing of cups and pots, brasen vessels and of tables.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why do thy disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashed hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He answered and said unto them, Well has Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honours me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Howbeit in vain do they honor me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men [as] the washing of pots and cups, and many other such like things ye do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he also said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother, and, Whosoever curses father or mother shall most definitely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But ye say, It is enough if a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] all Corban, (that is to say, my gift to God) whatever with which thou mightest be profited by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye suffer him to do no more for his father or for his mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>invalidating the word of God with your tradition, which ye have given; and many such like things do ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you] and understand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>there is nothing from outside the man that entering into him can defile him, but the things which come out of him, those are what defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not understand that anything from outside that enters into the man cannot defile him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, and [the man] goes out to the privy and purges all foods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For he had said that [it is] what comes out of the man that defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the heart of men, come forth the evil thoughts, the adulteries, the fornications, the murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>the thefts, the covetousness, the wickedness, the deceit, the lasciviousness, the evil eye, the slander, the pride, the unwiseness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all these evil things come out from within and defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And from there he arose and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entering into a house, desired that no man know [of it]; but he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him and came and fell at his feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation, and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled, for it is not good to take the children's bread and to cast [it] unto the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said unto her, For this word go; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when she came to her house, she found that the demon had gone out, and the daughter lay upon the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon unto the sea of Galilee through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And taking him aside from the multitude, he put his fingers into the man's ears; and spitting, he touched the man's tongue [with the saliva];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and looking up to heaven, he cried out, and said, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And straightway his ears were opened, and that which bound his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he charged them that they should tell no one; but the more he commanded them, so much more and more they published [it]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
