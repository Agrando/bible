[there is] none good but one, [that is], God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these I have observed from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the stake, and follow me taking up thy stake (if thy desire is to be perfect).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he, saddened by this word, went away grieved, for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus, looking around, said unto his disciples, How hardly shall those that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answered again and said unto them, Children, how hard is it for those that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier to pass a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But they were astonished even more, saying in themselves, Who then can save himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Jesus looking upon them said, For men [it is] impossible, but not for God because all things are possible for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter began to say unto him, Behold, we have left all and have followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And answering him, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no one that has left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel's</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive one hundredfold now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many [of the] first shall be last; and [of] the last first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them; and they were amazed, and they followed him with fear. Then, taking the twelve [aside] again, he began to tell them what things would happen unto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>[saying], Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the princes of the priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him; but the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou should do for us whatever we shall ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one at thy right hand and the other at thy left hand in thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask; can ye drink the cup that I drink? Or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and of the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but [it shall be given to those] for whom it is prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard [it], they began to be angry against James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Jesus, calling unto them, said unto them, Ye know that those who are seen to be princes among the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those that are great among them wield power over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But it shall not be like this among you, for whosoever desires to make himself great among you shall be your servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whosoever of you that desires to be first shall be servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to serve and to give his life in ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And so they come to Jericho, and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a [great] multitude, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many told him to be silent, but he cried even more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Have confidence, rise; he calls thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He, therefore, casting away his garment, rose and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus, answering, said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Master, that I might receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said unto him, Go; thy faith has saved thee. And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
