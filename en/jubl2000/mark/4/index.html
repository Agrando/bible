How then will ye understand all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower [is he who] sows the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are those by the way side, in whom the word is sown, but when they have heard, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And likewise these are those who are sown on stony ground, who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but have no root in themselves and are temporal; afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these are those who are sown among thorns, such as hear the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And these are those who are sown in good ground, such as hear the word and receive [it] and bring forth fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he also said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel or under the bed? and not to be set in the lampstand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested; nor secret which shall not be exposed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he also said unto them, Take heed what ye hear; with the measure ye measure by, ye shall be measured by others, and unto you that hear shall more be added.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he that has, to him shall be given; and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He also said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring [forth] and grow up, he knows not how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth brings forth fruit of herself: first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He also said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs and shoots out great branches, so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables he spoke the word unto them as they were able to hear [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But without a parable he did not speak unto them; and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And that same day, when evening was come, he said unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow; and they awoke him and said unto him, Master, dost thou not care that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And as he arose, he rebuked the wind and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly and said one to another, Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
