Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit tore him and cried with a loud voice and came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? What new doctrine [is] this? for he commands the unclean spirits with power, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Simon's mother-in-law lay sick of a fever, and soon they told him of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up; and the fever left her by and by, and she ministered unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In the evening, when the sun was down, they brought unto him all that were diseased and those that were possessed with devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many that were sick of diverse diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place and prayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and those that were with him followed after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns that I may preach there also, for truly I came forth for that purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And a leper came to him, beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus, having mercy on him, put forth [his] hand and touched him and said unto him, I will; be thou clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and said unto him, See thou say nothing to any man, but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out and began to publish [it] much and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places; and they came to him from every quarter.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
