There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell us, when shall these things be? and what [shall be] the sign when all things are to be finished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus, answering them, began to say, Take heed that no one deceive you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for many shall come in my name, saying, I Am [Christ] and shall deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled, for [such things] must needs be; but the end [shall] not [be] yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For people shall rise against people and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in each place, and there shall be famines and troubles: these [shall be] the beginnings of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But take heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you up in [the] councils, and in [the] synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be called before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the gospel needs to be preached unto all the Gentiles first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they shall bring you to deliver you up, do not premeditate beforehand what ye shall speak, neither think ye regarding [it], but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye, for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the brother shall deliver the brother unto death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against [their] parents and shall kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall be hated by everyone for my name, but he that shall persevere unto the end, the same shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation (spoken [of] by Daniel the prophet) standing where it ought not, he that reads, [let him] understand, then let those that [are] in Judaea flee to the mountains;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and let him that [is] on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter [therein] to take any thing out of his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and let him that is in the field not turn back again [even] to take up his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But woe to those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray, therefore, that your flight not be in winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For those days shall be of affliction such as never was from the beginning of the creation [of the things] which God created unto this time, neither shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved, but for the elect's sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And then if anyone should say to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or, Behold, [he is] there, do not believe [him];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for false Christs and false prophets shall rise and shall show signs and wonders to seduce, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But take ye heed; behold, I have told you everything beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in those days after that affliction, the sun shall darken, and the moon shall not give her light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers that [are] in the heavens shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth unto the uttermost part of the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Learn the similitude from the fig tree: When her branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves, ye know that summer is near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is near, [even] at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass until all these things are done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But of that day and [that] hour no one knows, no, not even the angels who are in the heaven, neither the Son, but only the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As the man who, taking a far journey, left his house and gave his estate to his servants and to each one his responsibility and commanded the porter to watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the Lord of the house comes: at evening or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what I say unto you, I say unto all: Watch.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
