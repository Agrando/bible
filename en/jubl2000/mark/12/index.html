A [certain] man planted a vineyard and set a hedge about [it] and dug [a place for] the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And taking him, they beat him and sent [him] away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And again he sent unto them another servant, and casting stones at him, they wounded [him] in the head and sent [him] away shamefully handled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And again he sent another, and him they killed and many others, beating some and killing some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the place shall be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And taking hold of him, they killed [him] and cast [him] out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What, therefore, shall the lord of the vineyard do? He shall come and destroy those husbandmen and shall give his vineyard unto others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And have ye not read this scripture: The stone which the builders rejected is placed as the head of the corner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they sought to lay hold on him but feared the multitude, for they understood that he had spoken the parable against them, and leaving him, they went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to catch him in [his] words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art [a] man of truth [who] regards no man; for thou dost not look upon [the] appearance of men, but dost with truth teach the way of God; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall we give or shall we not give? Then he, understanding their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me the coin that I may see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they brought it. And he said unto them, Of whom is this image and inscription? And they said unto him, Of Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Render that which [is] of Caesar unto Caesar, and that which is of God unto God. And they marvelled at this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then come unto him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother dies and leaves [his] wife [behind him] and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were seven brethren, and the first took a wife and dying left no seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed; and the third likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the seven had her and left no seed; last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection, therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus, answering, said unto them, Do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when they shall rise from the dead, neither shall they marry nor husbands take women nor women, husbands; but are as the angels who are in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And regarding the dead who are to rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spoke unto him, saying, I Am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not God of the dead, but God of the living; ye therefore do greatly err.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the scribes came, having heard their dispute and knowing that he had given a good response unto them, asked him, Which is the principal commandment of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus responded unto him, The principal of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God, the Lord is one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy thought and with all thy strength: this [is] the principal commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the second [is] like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth, that God is one, and there is none other outside of him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love [his] neighbour as himself is more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jesus, seeing that he responded wisely, said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him [any question].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And answering, Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David himself said by [the] Holy Spirit, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David therefore himself calls him Lord, and where [then] is he his son? And the many people heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who love to go in long clothing and [love] the salutations in the marketplaces</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the first chairs in the synagogues and the first seats at the suppers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>which devour widows' houses and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And with Jesus sitting in front of the ark of the offering, he beheld how the people cast money into the ark and many that were rich cast in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as there came a certain poor widow, she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then calling his disciples, he said unto them, Verily I say unto you that this poor widow has cast more in than all those who have cast into the treasury,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for [they] all did cast in of their abundance, but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
