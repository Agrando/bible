How long must I suffer you? Bring him unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him unto him; and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tore him; and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And [Jesus] asked his father, How long ago is it since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ofttimes it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to kill him, but if thou canst do any thing, help us, having mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe this, all things [are] possible to him that believes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And straightway the father of the child crying out with tears, said, Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Jesus saw that the multitude concurred, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, [Thou] dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him and enter no more into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the spirit, crying out and rending him sore, came out; and [he] remained as one dead, [insomuch] that many said that he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus, taking him by the hand, straightened him up; and he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And having left there, they walked together through Galilee; and he did not wish that anyone should know of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he went on teaching his disciples and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after he is dead, he shall rise the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they did not understand this word and were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he came to Capernaum; and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves on the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they were silent; for on the way they had disputed among themselves, who [should be] the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then, sitting down, he called the twelve and said unto them, If anyone desires to be first, [the same] shall be last of all and servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name and he does not follow us; and we forbade him because he does not follow us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said, Forbid him not, for there is no one who does a miracle in my name that can then speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For he that is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye are of the Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whosoever shall be a stumbling block to one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it would be better for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if thy hand causes thee to fall, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that can never be quenched,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>where their worm does not die, and the fire is never quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if thy foot causes thee to fall, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that can never be quenched,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>where their worm does not die, and the fire is never quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if thine eye causes thee to fall, pluck it out; it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>where their worm does not die, and the fire is never quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt [is] good, but if the salt has lost its saltness, with what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
