Who can forgive sins but God only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus, knowing afterward in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said unto them, Why think ye these things in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What is easier to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and take up thy bed and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins (he spoke to the sick of the palsy),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say unto thee, Arise and take up thy bed and go to thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by and by he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like unto this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went again unto the sea; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him, Follow me.
