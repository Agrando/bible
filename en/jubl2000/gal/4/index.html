for I bear you record that if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Am I, therefore, become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are zealous after you, [but] not [for] good; they would exclude you [from us], that ye might be zealous after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good to be always zealous to [do] good, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ is formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice, for I stand in doubt of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, have ye not heard the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, but he of the freewoman [was born] through the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things are an allegory; for these [women] are the two covenants: the one from the mount Sinai, which begat unto bondage, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this Hagar or Sinai is a mount in Arabia, which corresponds to the one that is now Jerusalem, which [together] with her children is in bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem of above is free, which is the mother of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth [into praise] and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So that we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to the Spirit, even so [it is] now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nevertheless what does the scripture say?
