He did not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this I say [that regarding] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel it, that it should make the promise of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance [is] of the law, [it is] no longer of promise; but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what then [serves] the law? It was added because of rebellions until the seed should come to whom the promise was made, [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[Is] the law then against the promises of God? No, in no wise, for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when faith is come, we are no longer under [the hand] of the schoolmaster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For ye are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[Here] there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if ye [are] Christ's, then ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
