and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, but the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the LORD shall go forth and fight against those Gentiles as when he fought in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which [is] before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, [making] a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal; and ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and the LORD my God shall come, [and] all his saints with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it shall come to pass in that day [that] the light shall not be clear, [nor] dark;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but it shall be one day which is known to the LORD, not day, nor night; but it shall come to pass, [that] at evening time there shall be light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be in that day [that] living waters shall go out from Jerusalem: half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter it shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD shall be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD shall be one, and his name one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the land shall become a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate unto the gate of the corners, and [from] the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And [men] shall dwell in it, and it shall never be anathema again; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the peoples that fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall come to pass in that day [that] a great destruction from the LORD shall be in them, for they shall lay hold each one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah also shall fight against Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the Gentiles round about shall be gathered together: gold and silver and apparel in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that were in the armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of the hosts, and to celebrate the feast of the tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall be [that] whoever will not come up of [all] the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of the hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the family of Egypt does not go up and does not come, there shall be no [rain] upon them; [instead] there shall be the plague, with which the LORD will smite the Gentiles that do not come up to celebrate the feast of the tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This shall be [the punishment] of the sin of Egypt and of the sin of all the Gentiles that do not come up to celebrate the feast of the tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day there shall be [written] upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of the hosts; and all those that sacrifice shall come and take of them and cook therein; and in that time there shall be no more merchandizing in the house of the LORD of the hosts.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
