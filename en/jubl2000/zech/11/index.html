For I took unto me two staves: the one I named Beauty, and the other Bands; and I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I also cut off three shepherds in one month; and my soul was in anguish for them, and their soul also abhorred me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, I will not feed you [any longer]; the one that dies, let it die; and the one that is to be lost, let it be lost; and let the rest eat each one the flesh of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I took my staff, [even] Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock that look unto me knew that it [was] the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give [me]my wages; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my wages thirty [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the treasury: a goodly price that I was appraised at by them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver and cast them in the house of the LORD unto the treasury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I cut asunder my other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, behold, I raise up a shepherd in the land, [which] shall not visit those that are lost, neither shall seek the young one nor heal the one that is broken nor carry the one that is tired, but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their hoofs in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Woe to the useless pastor that leaves the flock! the sword [shall be] upon his arm and upon his right eye; his arm shall be completely dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
