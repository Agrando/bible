Nevertheless when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke this parable unto some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee that I am not as other men [are]: extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast two [meals] every sabbath; I give tithes of all that I possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God, reconcile me, a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other; for anyone that exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them; but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called them [unto him] and said, Suffer [the] little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain prince asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said unto him, Why dost thou call me good? No one [is] good except one, [that is], God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou knowest the commandments, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now when Jesus heard this, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How difficultly shall those that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier to put a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And those that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter said, Behold, we have left all and followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no one that has left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God's sake</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the age to come, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he took [unto him] the twelve and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully treated and spitted on;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and they shall scourge [him] and put him to death, but the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they did not know what was said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass that as he came near unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat beside the way begging,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried out, saying, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who went before rebuked him that he should remain silent; but he cried out so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought unto him, and when he was come near, he asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said unto him, See; thy faith has saved thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he saw and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise unto God.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
