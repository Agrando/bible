And he took [him] and healed him and dismissed him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they could not answer him as to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And observing how they chose the first seats at the table, he put forth a parable to those who were invited, saying unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When thou art called to a wedding by anyone, do not sit down in the highest place, lest a more honourable man than thou be invited of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he that called thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place, and thou begin with shame to have the lowest place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when thou art called, go and sit down in the lowest place that when he that invited thee comes, he may say unto thee, Friend, come up higher; then shalt thou have glory in the presence of those that sit [at the table] with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For whosoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he also to him that invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren neither thy kinsmen nor [thy] rich neighbours, lest they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when thou makest a banquet, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when one of those that sat [at the table] with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed [is] he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper and called many</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and sent his servant at supper time to say to those that were called, Come, for all things are now ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they all with one [consent] began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I have need to go and see it; I pray thee have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that servant came and showed his lord these things. Then the husband of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges and compel [them] to come in that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I say unto you, That none of those men which were called shall taste of my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And great multitudes went with him, and he turned and said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, and even his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whosoever does not bear his stake and come after me cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has [sufficient] to finish [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lest perhaps after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish [it], all that behold [it] begin to mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king going to make war against another king does not sit down first and consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an embassy and desires conditions of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So likewise, any one of you that does not forsake all that he has cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Salt [is] good; but if the salt has lost its savour, with what shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is neither good for the land, nor for the dunghill; it is cast out.
