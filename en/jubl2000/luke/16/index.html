Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou may no longer be steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes the stewardship away from me; I cannot dig, [and] I am ashamed to beg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what I shall do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he called each one of his lord's debtors [unto him] and said unto the first, How much dost thou owe unto my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said he to another, And how much dost thou owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done discreetly; for the sons of this age are in their generation more prudent than the sons of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say unto you, Make friends unto yourselves with the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when these fail, you may be received into eternal dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that is faithful with little is faithful also with much, and he that is unjust with little is unjust also with much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things, and they derided him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto them, Ye are they who justify themselves before men, but God knows your hearts, for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets [were] until John; since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and whosoever [will] presses into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whosoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery, and whosoever marries her that is put away of [her] husband commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom; the rich man also died and was buried;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime didst receive thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted [here], and thou art tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who would pass from here to you cannot; neither can they pass from there to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou would send him to my father's house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham said unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, No, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said unto him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, [even] though one rose from the dead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
