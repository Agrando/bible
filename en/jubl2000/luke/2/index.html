for, behold, I bring you [a] gospel of great joy, which shall be to all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For unto you is born this day in the city of David [a] Saviour, who is Christ [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this [shall be] a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will in man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they had seen [it], they made known abroad that which had been told them concerning this child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all those that heard [it] marvelled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Mary kept all these things, pondering [them] in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which he was called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem to present [him] to the Lord</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name [was] Simeon, and the same man [was] just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he should see the Christ of [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came by the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for mine eyes have seen thy saving health,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a light to be revealed unto the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this [child] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was of a great age and had lived with [her] husband seven years from her virginity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and she [was] a widow eighty-four years, who departed not from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and spoke of him to all those that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they had completed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the child grew and was comforted of [the] Spirit, filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having completed the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey, and they sought him among [their] kinsfolk and acquaintances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when they saw him, they were amazed; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Knew ye not that it behooves me to be about my Father's business?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they understood not the word which he spoke unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them, but his mother kept all these things in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus increased in wisdom and [in] age and in grace with God and men.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
