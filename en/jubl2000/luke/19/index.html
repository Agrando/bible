Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said unto those that stood by, Take from him the mina and give [it] to him that has the ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(And they said unto him, Lord, he has ten minas.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For I say unto you, That unto every one who has shall be given; and from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Moreover, those enemies of mine, who were unwilling that I should reign over them, bring them here and slay [them] before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, Go ye into the village over against [you], in which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, upon whom no one has ever sat; loose him, and bring [him here].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if anyone asks you, Why do ye loose [him]? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And those that were sent went and found even as he had said unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought him to Jesus, and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when he was come near, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, Blessed [be] the King that comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in [the] highest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that if these should be silent the stones would immediately cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he was come near, he beheld the city and wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things [which belong] unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and constrain thee on every side</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and shall cast thee down to the ground and thy children within thee, and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he went into the temple and began to cast out those selling and buying therein,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying unto them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he taught daily in the temple. But the princes of the priests and the scribes and the principals of the people sought to kill him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and could not find what they might do, for all the people were very attentive to hear him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
