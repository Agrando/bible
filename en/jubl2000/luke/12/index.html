Fear not, therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but he that denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, there is forgiveness for him; but unto him that blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they bring you unto the synagogues and [unto] magistrates and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one of the crowd said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto them, Take heed and beware of [all] covetousness; for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he spoke a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my storehouses and build greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and] be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said unto him, [Thou] fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast stored up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So [is] he that lays up treasure for himself and is not rich in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The life is more than food, and the body [is more] than raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If ye then are not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If then God so clothes the grass, which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more [will he clothe] you, O ye of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And seek not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, neither be ye high minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all these things do the Gentiles of the world seek after, and your Father knows that ye have need of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But rather seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell what ye have and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches neither moth corrupts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your loins be girded about and [your] lamps burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open unto him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed [are] those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching; verily I say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to food and will come forth and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find [them] so, blessed are those servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And know this: that if the husband of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Be ye therefore ready also; for the Son of man comes at an hour when ye think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us or even to all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom [his] lord shall make ruler over his household to give [them their] portion of food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed [is] that servant whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Of a truth I say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But and if that servant [shall] say in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not look for [him] and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him off and will appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that servant who knew his lord's will and prepared not [himself], neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many [stripes].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few [stripes]. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required; and to whom much was committed, more will be asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I am come to cast fire into the earth; and what do I desire, except that it be kindled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am anguished until it is accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Think ye that I am come to the earth to give peace? No, I tell you, but rather division;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for from now on there shall be five in one house divided: three against two and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father, the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother, the mother-in-law against her daughter- in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he said also to the people, When ye see the cloud rising out of the west, straightway ye say, A shower comes, and so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when the south wind blows, ye say, There will be heat, and it comes to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>[Ye] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, [as thou art] in the way, give diligence that thou may be delivered from him, lest he drag thee away to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell thee, in no wise shalt thou come out of there until thou hast paid the very last mite.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
