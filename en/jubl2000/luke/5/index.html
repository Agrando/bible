And he sat down and taught the people out of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing; nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net was breaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they beckoned unto [their] partners, who were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Simon Peter saw [it], he fell down on [his] knees before Jesus, saying, Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he was overcome with fear, and all that [were] with him, at the catch of the fishes which they had taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from now on thou shalt catch men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy who, seeing Jesus, fell on [his] face and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he put forth [his] hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he charged him to tell no one. But go and show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But so much the more his fame went forth, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man who was paralysed, and they sought [means] to bring him in and to lay [him] before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they could not find any way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with [his] couch into the midst before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Jesus, knowing their thoughts [and] answering them said, What reason ye in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>What is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Rise up and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that ye may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins (he said unto the paralytic), I say unto thee, Arise and take up thy couch and go to thine house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately he rose up before them and took up that upon which he lay and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen marvels today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after these things he went forth and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom, and he said unto him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made a great banquet in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down at the table with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus answering said unto them, Those that are whole have no need of a physician, but those that are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I came not to call [the] righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers and likewise [the disciples] of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he also spoke a parable unto them: No one takes a piece of a new garment to mend an old one; if otherwise, then the new one is rent, and the piece that was [taken] out of the new does not agree with the old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; [or] else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled and the wineskins shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>No one also having drunk of the old straightway desires the new, for he says, The old is better.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
