And he arose and stood forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil? to save [a] person or to destroy [them]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so, and his hand was restored whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they were filled with madness and talked one with another [about] what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, he called [unto him] his disciples; and of them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon (whom he also named Peter) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew and Thomas, James the [son] of Alphaeus and Simon called Zelotes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Judas [the brother] of James and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came down with them and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and those that were tormented with unclean spirits were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the whole multitude sought to touch him, for there went virtue out of him and healed [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said, Blessed [are] the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed [are those] that hunger now, for ye shall be filled. Blessed [are those] that weep now, for ye shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you [from their company] and shall reproach [you] and cast out your name as evil for the sake of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy; for, behold, your reward [is] great in heaven, for their fathers treated the prophets in the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers treat the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say unto you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those that curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And unto the one that smites thee on the [one] cheek offer also the other, and to the one that takes away thy cloak defend not [thy] coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to everyone that asks of thee, and of the one that takes away thy goods ask [them] not to return them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as ye desire that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if ye love those who love you, what grace shall ye have? for sinners also love those that love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if ye do good to those who do good to you, what grace shall ye have? for sinners also do even the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if ye lend [to those] of whom ye hope to receive, what grace shall ye have? for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But rather love ye your enemies and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again, and your reward shall be great; and ye shall be the sons of the Most High, for he is kind [even] unto the unthankful and [to] the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down and shaken together and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure out it shall be measured to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he spoke a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the pit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not above his master, but any one that is as the master shall be perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but not perceive the beam that is in thine own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself dost not behold the beam that is in thine own eye? Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush do they gather grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil, for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Whosoever comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation upon rock; and when the flood arose, the river beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it, for it was founded upon rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he that hears and does not do is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation against which the river beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
