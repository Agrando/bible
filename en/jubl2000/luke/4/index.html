And in those days he ate nothing; and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the devil said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the devil took him up into a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the sphere of the world in a moment of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the devil said unto him, All this authority I will give thee and the glory of them, for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from here;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And having finished all temptation, the devil departed from him for a season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and his fame went out through all the region round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up; and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those that are broken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he closed the book, and he gave [it] again to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of all those that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he began to say unto them, Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all bore him witness and marvelled at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself; whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but unto none of them was Elijah sent, except unto Sarepta, [a city] of Sidon, unto a woman [that was] a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill upon which their city was built that they might cast him down headlong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine, for his word was with power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon and cried out with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, [thou] Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art: the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent and come out of him. And the demon, throwing him down in the midst, came out of him and hurt him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What word [is] this! For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And his fame went out into every place of the country round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever, and they besought him for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now when the sun was setting, all those who had anyone sick with diverse diseases brought them unto him, and laying his hands on each one of them, he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, Thou art the Christ, the Son of God. And he rebuking [them] suffered them not to speak, for they knew that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place, and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he said unto them, I must announce the gospel of the kingdom of God to other cities also because for this am I sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
