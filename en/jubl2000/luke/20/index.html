I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence [him] when they see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed [him]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard [it], they said, May it not be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he beheld them and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the princes of the priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him, for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them; but they feared the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they watched [him] and sent forth spies who feigned themselves just men that they might take hold of him as he was speaking, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither dost thou accept the person [of any], but teachest the way of God with truth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar or no?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he, perceiving their craftiness, said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesar's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things which are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they could not take hold of his words before the people, and they marvelled at his answer and were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then certain of the Sadducees came, who deny that there is any resurrection, and they asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There were therefore seven brethren, and the first took a wife and died without children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also, and they left no children and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be? for seven had her to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus answering said unto them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but those who are accounted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry, nor are given in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for neither can they die any more, for they are equal unto the angels and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed [this] at the bush when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And after that they dared not ask him any [question at all].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said unto them, How do they say that the Christ is David's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And David himself says in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David therefore calls him Lord; how is he then his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then in the audience of all the people, he said unto his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the first seats in the synagogues and the first places at suppers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour the houses of the widows and for a pretext make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
