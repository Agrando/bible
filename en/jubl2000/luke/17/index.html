I think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he entered into a certain village, ten men that were lepers met him, who stood afar off</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and lifted up their voices and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he saw [them], he said unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass that as they went, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and with a loud voice glorified God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and fell down on [his] face at his feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where [are] the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Were there not found any returning to give glory to God, except this stranger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto him, Arise, go; thy faith has saved thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he was asked of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>neither shall they say, Behold it here! or, Behold it there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said unto the disciples, The days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall say to you, Behold it here, or, Behold it there; do not go, nor follow [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightning, which shines from the region under heaven, shines in that which is under heaven; so also shall the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he who shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whosoever shall seek to save his soul shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose it shall cause it to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you in that night there shall be two [men] in one bed: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two [women] shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Two [men] shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body [is], there will the eagles be gathered together.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
