And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how the princes of the priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we were hoping that it was he who should redeem Israel, and beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Although also certain women of our company made us astonished, who before daybreak were at the sepulchre;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and when they did not find his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And certain of those who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said; but they did not see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter (like this) into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded [this] unto them in all the scriptures concerning himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew near unto the village where they went, and he made as though he would have gone further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass as he sat [at the table] with them, he took bread and blessed [it] and broke and gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us in the way and while he opened to us the scriptures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and those that were with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, The Lord is risen indeed and has appeared to Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they told what things [were done] in the way and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they were seeing a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had thus spoken, he showed them [his] hands and [his] feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And [as they were] not believing him yet for joy and wondering, he said unto them, Have ye here any food?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he took [it] and ate before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and [in] the prophets and [in] the psalms, concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And ye are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And, behold, I shall send the promise of my Father upon you, but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye are endued with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
