Shall their unbelief have made the truth of God without effect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>No, in no wise: for God is true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou might be justified in thy words and might overcome when thou dost judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if our iniquity commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Shall [for this reason] God be unjust who sends punishment? (I speak as a man.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No, in no wise: for then how shall God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why even so am I also judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And why not say (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? The condemnation of whom is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Are we better [than they]? No, in no wise; for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as it is written, There is no one righteous, no, not one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>there is no one that understands; there is no one that seeks after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They are all gone out of the way; they are together become unprofitable; there is no one that does good, no, not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>their feet [are] swift to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>destruction and misery [are] in their ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the way of peace they have not known;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>there is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that all that the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may submit themselves unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For by the deeds of the law, no flesh shall be justified in his sight; for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now, without the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>the righteousness, that is, of God by the faith of Jesus, the Christ, for all and upon all those that believe in him, for there is no difference;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for all have sinned and are made destitute of the glory of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[being] justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus, the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God purposed for reconciliation through faith in his blood for the manifestation of his righteousness, for the remission of sins that are past, by the patience of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>manifesting in this time his righteousness that he [only] be the just [one] and the justifier of him that is of the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No, but by [the] law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, we conclude that [a] man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[Is he] the God of the Jews only? [Is he] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>seeing [it is] one God who shall justify the circumcision by faith and [the] uncircumcision by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make void the law through faith? No, in no wise; to the contrary, we establish the law.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
