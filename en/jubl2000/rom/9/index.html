Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not as though the word of God has been deficient. For not all the descendants of Israel are Israelites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are all sons, but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, Those who [are] sons of the flesh, these [are] not the sons of God; but those who [are] sons of the promise [are] counted in the generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the word of the promise [is] this, At this time I will come, and Sara shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only [this], but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(for [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand: not of works, but of him that calls),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we say then? [Is there] injustice in God? No, in no wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that has mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the scripture saith of Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore he has mercy on whom he will [have mercy], and he hardens whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why does he become angry? For who shall resist his will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rather, O man, who art thou to reply against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[What] if God, desiring to show [his] wrath and to make his power known, endured with much meekness the vessels of wrath, prepared for death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and making known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared unto glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Even us, whom he has called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, who were not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall come to pass [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people, there shall they be called sons of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel, Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant shall be saved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>when the consumption comes to an end, righteousness shall overflow, because a short sentence will the Lord execute upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as Isaiah said before, Except the Lord of the hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom and been made like unto Gomorrha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, that is to say, the righteousness which is by faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why? Because [they followed it] not by faith but, as it were, by the works (of the law); therefore, they stumbled on the stumblingstone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock [that will cause some] to fall, and whosoever believes in him shall not be ashamed.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
