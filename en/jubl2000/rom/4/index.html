Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But unto him that works, the reward is not reckoned as grace, but as debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to him that does not work, but believes in him that justifies the ungodly, the faith is counted as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man unto whom God doth attribute righteousness without works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[saying], Blessed [are] those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord did not impute sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is this blessedness, therefore, only upon the circumcision or also upon the uncircumcision? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received the circumcision as [a] sign, as [a] seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had, yet] being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all the uncircumcised believers, that it might be counted unto them also as righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that [he be] the father of the circumcision: not only to those who are of the circumcision, but also unto those who walk in the steps of the faith that was in our father Abraham before he was circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the promise that he should be the heir of the world [was] not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if those who are of the law [are] the heirs, faith is [in] vain, and the promise annulled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>because the law works wrath; for where there is no law, [there is] no rebellion either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore by faith, that [it might be] by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all [the] seed, not only to that which is of the law, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>as it is written, As a father of many Gentiles have I placed thee before God, whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which are not as those that are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who believed to wait against [all] hope, that he might become the father of many Gentiles, according to that which had been spoken [unto him], So shall thy seed be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he did not weaken in faith: he considered not his own body now dead when he was about one hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>he doubted not the promise of God, with unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>being fully persuaded that he was also powerful to do all that he had promised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>therefore, [his faith] was also attributed unto him as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it is not written for his sake alone that it was [so] reckoned to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but for us also to whom it shall be [so] reckoned, that is, to those that believe in him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
