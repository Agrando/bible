Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, that person is not of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if Christ is in you, the body is truly dead because of sin, but the Spirit [is] alive because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up the Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die; but if through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all that are led by the Spirit of God, the same are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage to be in fear [again], but ye have received the Spirit of adoption [of sons], whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the same Spirit bears witness unto our spirit that we are sons of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if sons, also heirs certainly of God and joint-heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with [him] that we may be also glorified together [with him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know with certainty that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory which shall be manifested in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the [earnest] hope of the creatures waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creatures were subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>with the hope that the same creatures shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we [now] know that all the creatures groan [together] and travail in pain [together] until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only they, but ourselves also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [that is to say], the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For in hope we are saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, he does not wait for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we wait for that which we do not see, with patience we wait for [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And likewise also the Spirit helps our weakness; for we know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself makes entreaty for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he that searches the hearts knows what is the desire of the Spirit, that according to [the will of] God, he makes entreaty for the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we [now] know that unto those who love God, all things help them unto good, to those who according to the purpose are called [to be saints].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For [unto] those whom he knew beforehand, he also marked out beforehand [the way] that they might be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And unto those whom he did mark out beforehand [the way], to these he also called; and to whom he called, these he also justified; and to whom he justified, these he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What shall we then say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [shall be] against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also give us all things with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall accuse the chosen of God's? God [is] he that justifies [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who [is] he that condemns [them]? Christ, Jesus, is he who died [and], even more, he that also rose again, who furthermore is at the right hand of God, who also makes entreaty for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the charity of Christ? [shall] tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>(As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nevertheless, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore I am certain that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the charity of God, which is in Christ, Jesus our Lord.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
