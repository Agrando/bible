[Is] the law sin? No, in no wise. But, I did not know sin except by the law; for [neither] would I have known lust if the law did not say, Thou shalt not covet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then sin, when there was occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of lust. For without the law sin was as if it were dormant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So that without the law I lived for some time; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I found that the [same] commandment, which was unto life, was mortal [unto me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, having had occasion, deceived me by the commandment and by it killed [me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the law is truly holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Was then that which is good made death unto me? No, in no wise. But sin, to show itself sin by that which is good, worked death in me, making sin exceedingly sinful by the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we [now] know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold unto subjection by sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that which I do, I do not understand, and not even the [good] that I desire [is what] I do; but what I hate, that [is what] I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If then I do that which I do not desire, I approve that the law [is] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So that it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing; for I have the desire, but I am not able to perform that which is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I do not do the good that I desire; but the evil which I do not desire, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if I do that which I do not desire, I am not working, but sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that, desiring to do good, I find [this] law: evil is natural unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight with the law of God with the inward man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see another law in my members which rebels against the law of my mind, bringing captive unto the law of sin which is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The grace of God, by Jesus, the Christ, our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
