but, as it is written, The reproaches of those that reproached thee fell on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction that we, through patient [endurance] and through the comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be unanimous among yourselves according to Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that ye may with one accord [and] one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore bear one another, as the Christ also bore us, to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I say that Christ Jesus, was [a] minister of the circumcision, by the truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] unto the fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but that the Gentiles glorify God by mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess thee among the Gentiles and sing unto thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And again he says, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify him, all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall wait [for salvation].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And believing, the God of hope fills you with all joy and peace that ye may abound in hope by the virtue of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I am convinced regarding you, my brethren, that even without my exhortation ye are full of charity, full of all knowledge, so as to be able to admonish one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nevertheless I have written, brethren, in part boldly, as admonishing you by the grace that is given [to] me of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>being the minister of Jesus Christ, to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be well pleasing, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I have something to boast of in Christ Jesus, with regard to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not wrought by me, unto the obedience of the Gentiles, with word and with deed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>with power of signs and wonders, in virtue of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum, I have filled the entire [area] with the gospel of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in this manner I preached this gospel, not where Christ had been named [previously], not to build upon a foundation belonging to another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but, as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see, and those that have not heard shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For which reason I have even been hindered many times from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now having more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when I leave for Spain, I will come unto you; for I trust to see you on my journey and to be taken there by you, if first I may enjoy your company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it has pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints who are in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It has pleased them verily, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they should also minister unto them in carnal things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So that, when I have concluded this and have delivered unto them this fruit, I will come by you unto Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Spirit, that ye help me with prayers to God for me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Judaea and that the offering of my service to the saints in Jerusalem may be accepted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God and may be refreshed together with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the God of peace [be] with you all. Amen.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
