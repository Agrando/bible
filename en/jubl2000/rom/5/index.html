For if through the offense of [that] one many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of one man, Jesus the Christ, has abounded unto many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Nor was it in the same manner as by one sin, likewise also the gift; for the judgment truly [came] of one [sin] unto condemnation, but grace [came] of many offenses unto justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if by one offense, death reigned [because] of one [man]; much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of gifts and of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore, in the same manner that by the iniquity of one [guilt came] upon all men unto condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, [grace came] upon all men unto justification of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover the law entered that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that in the same manner as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus, the Christ, our Lord.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
