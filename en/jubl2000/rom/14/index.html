By his [own] master he stands or falls; and [if he falls], he shall be made to stand, for God is powerful to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also, some make a difference between one day and another; others esteem every day [alike]. Let each one be fully persuaded in his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that observes the day, let him observe it unto the Lord; and he that does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe [it]. He that eats, eats unto the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, unto the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us live for ourselves, and no one dies for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ both died and rose [and revived]: to thus exercise lordship over the dead as well as over the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou belittle thy brother? for we shall all stand before the tribunal of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us, therefore, not judge one another any more, but judge this rather: that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother's way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and trust in the Lord Jesus that for his sake there is nothing unclean, but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if thy brother is grieved because of [thy] food, now thou dost not walk in charity. Do not destroy him with thy food, for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not then your good be evil spoken of;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he that in these things serves the Christ [is] well pleasing unto God and approved of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let us, therefore, follow after the things which make for peace and the edification of each one to the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because of food, do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed [are] clean, but [it is] evil for that man who eats with offense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[It is] good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor [do any thing] by which thy brother stumbles or is offended or is sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou hast faith; have [it] to thyself before God. Blessed [is] he that does not condemn himself with that thing which he allows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he that makes a difference is condemned if he eats, because [he] does not [eat] by faith; and whatsoever [is] not out of faith is sin.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
