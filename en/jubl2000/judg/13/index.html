And he said, I [am].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Manoah said, Now let thy word come to pass. How shall we order the child, and what shall he do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the angel of the LORD replied unto Manoah, Let the woman keep herself from all that I said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She may not eat of any [thing] that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean [thing]; all that I commanded her let her keep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the angel of the LORD replied unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread, but if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, sacrifice it unto the LORD. For Manoah did not know that this [was] the angel of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What [is] thy name that when thy words come to pass we may honour thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the angel of the LORD replied, Why dost thou ask for my name? It [is] wonderful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took a kid with a present and sacrificed [it] upon a rock unto the LORD, and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar as Manoah and his wife looked on, and they prostrated themselves on the ground on their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the angel of the LORD did not appear any more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he [was] the angel of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die because we have seen God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his wife said unto him, If the LORD had desired to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and the present from our hands, neither would he have showed us all these [things], nor would he have announced this according to the time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Spirit of the LORD began to manifest himself at times in him in the camps of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
