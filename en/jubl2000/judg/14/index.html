And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But his father and his mother did not know that it [was] of the LORD that he sought an occasion against the Philistines, for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Samson went down with his father and his mother to Timnath, and when they came to the vineyards of Timnath, behold, a young lion came roaring against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and [he had] nothing in his hand, but [he] did not make known unto his father or his mother what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside [from the way] to see the carcase of the lion; and, behold, [there was] a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he took of it in his hands and went along the way eating, and when he came to his father and mother, he also gave them some to eat, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made a banquet there, for the young men used to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>unto whom Samson said, I will now put forth an enigma unto you, which if ye can declare it and discover it to me within the seven days of the banquet, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if ye cannot declare [it] to me, then ye shall give me thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy enigma that we may hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not declare the enigma in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband that he may declare unto us this enigma lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire. Have ye called us here to impoverish us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samson's wife wept before him and said, Thou dost only hate me and dost not love me, for thou hast not declared unto me the enigma that thou hast put forth unto the sons of my people. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told [it] to my father nor my mother, and must I tell [it to] thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she wept before him the seven days while their banquet lasted, but on the seventh day, he told her, because she lay sore upon him, and she declared the enigma to the sons of her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey? And what [is] stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye would have never discovered my enigma.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and taking their spoil, he gave the changes of garments to those who had explained the enigma. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, who had fed him [before].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
