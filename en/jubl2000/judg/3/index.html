And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gathered unto him the sons of Ammon and of Amalek and went and smote Israel and took the city of palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a saviour, Ehud, the son of Gera, a son of Jemini, a man, who had his right hand impeded, and by him the sons of Israel sent a present unto Eglon, the king of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Ehud had made himself a two-edged sword of a cubit length, and he girded it under his clothing upon his right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he brought the present unto Eglon, king of Moab, and Eglon [was] a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had offered the present, he sent away the people that had brought the present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he, himself turned again from the graven images that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word for thee, O king, who then said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ehud came unto him, and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee. Then he arose out of [his] seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Ehud put forth his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into Eglon's belly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>in such a manner that the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly, and the excrement came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that the doors of the parlour [were] locked, they said, Peradventure he covers his feet in his summer chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having waited until they were confounded and he [had] not opened the doors of the parlour; therefore, they took a key and opened [them]; and, behold, their lord [was] fallen down dead on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But while they had waited, Ehud escaped and passed beyond the graven images and escaped unto Seirath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he entered in, he blew the shofar in the mountain of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he said unto them, Follow after me, for the LORD has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands. And they went down after him and took the fords of the Jordan towards Moab and did not let anyone pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all fat, and all men of war, and there escaped not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subjected that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after him was Shamgar, the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad, and he also saved Israel.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
