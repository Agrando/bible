And they chided with him sharply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he replied unto them, What have I done now in comparison with you? [Is] not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him when he spoke that word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Gideon came to pass the Jordan, he and the three hundred men that [were] with him, faint from the pursuit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto those of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they [are] faint [that I may] pursue after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the principals of Succoth said, [Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we should give bread unto thy army?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns and the briers of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he went up from there to Penuel and spoke unto them likewise; and those of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Zebah and Zalmunna [were] in Karkor and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand [men], all that were left of all the hosts of the sons of the east, for one hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword [had been] slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Gideon went up by the way of those that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah and smote the camp, for the camp was secure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna and terrified all the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Gideon, the son of Joash, returned from the battle before the sun [was up]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and caught a young man of the men of Succoth and enquired of him; and he described unto him the principals of Succoth and the elders thereof, seventy-seven men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he came unto the men of Succoth and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, [Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thy men [that are] weary?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he took the elders of the city and thorns and briars of the wilderness, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Likewise he beat down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he said unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men [were those] whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou [art], so [were] they; each one resembled the sons of a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, They [were] my brethren, the sons of my mother; [as] the LORD lives, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Rise up [and] slay them. But the youth did not draw his sword, for he feared because he [was] yet a youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou and fall upon us, for as the man [is], [so is] his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna and took away the ornaments that [were] on their camels' necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy son and thy son's son also, for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Gideon replied, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon said unto them, I desire to make a request of you that ye each one would give me the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings because they [were] Ishmaelites.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they answered, We will willingly give [them]. And they spread a garment, and each one cast therein the earrings of his prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand seven hundred [shekels] of gold, without the ornaments and collars and purple clothing that [was] on the kings of Midian and without the chains that [were] about their camels' necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Gideon made an ephod of them and kept it in his city of Ophrah, and all Israel fornicated after it in that place, and it became a snare unto Gideon and to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus Midian was broken before the sons of Israel so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the land rested forty years in the days of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and dwelt in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Gideon had seventy sons that came out of his loins, for he had many wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his concubine that [was] in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Gideon, the son of Joash, died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash, his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead that the sons of Israel turned again and fornicated after the Baalim and made Baalberith their god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the sons of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>neither were they merciful with the house of Jerubbaal, [namely], Gideon, according to all the good which he had done unto Israel.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
