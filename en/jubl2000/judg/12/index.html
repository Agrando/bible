We will burn thy house upon thee with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jephthah replied unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon, and when I called you, ye did not defend me from their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Seeing, therefore, that ye did not defend [me], I put my life in my hands and went over against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand. Why then have ye come up against me this day to fight with me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim because they had said, Ye [are] fugitives of Ephraim; ye are Gileadites among Ephraim and Manassah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Gileadites took the passages of the Jordan from Ephraim; and it was [such] that when any of those of Ephraim who had escaped would say, May I pass?
