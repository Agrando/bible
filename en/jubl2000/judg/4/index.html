And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went up with ten thousand men on foot, and Deborah went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Heber, the Kenite, of the sons of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which [is] by Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the news came unto Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, was gone up to Mount Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, [even] nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that [were] with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Deborah said unto Barak, Rise up, for this [is] the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into thy hands. Is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor and ten thousand men after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD broke Sisera and all [his] chariots and all [his] host with the edge of the sword before Barak so that Sisera lighted down off [his] chariot and fled away on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto Harosheth of the Gentiles, and all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword, [and] there was not a man left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for [there was] peace between Jabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jael went out to meet Sisera and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a thick coverlet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk and gave him to drink and covered him again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and if anyone should come and enquire of thee and say, Is there anyone here? Thou shalt say, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jael, Heber's wife, took the tent stake, and putting a hammer in her hand, went softly unto him and smote the stake into his temples and fastened it into the ground, for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he entered into where she was, behold, Sisera lay dead with the stake through his temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So God subjected on that day Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the hand of the sons of Israel began to prosper and to prevail against Jabin, the king of Canaan until they had destroyed him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
