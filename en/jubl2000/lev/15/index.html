and everything upon which he sits shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe [himself] in water and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he that sits on [any] thing upon which the one that has the issue sat shall wash his clothes and bathe [himself] in water and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Likewise he that touches the flesh of the one that has the issue shall wash his clothes and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the one that has the issue spits upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe [himself] in water and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And any saddle that he that has the issue rides upon shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the evening, and he that bears [any of] those things shall wash his clothes and bathe [himself] in water and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whoever the one that has the issue touches and has not washed his hands with water, he shall wash his clothes and bathe [himself] in water and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the vessel of earth that the one that has the issue touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be washed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the one that has an issue is cleansed of his issue;
