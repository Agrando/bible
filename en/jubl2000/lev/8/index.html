also upon the mitre, [even] upon his forefront, he put the open flower of gold, the crown of holiness, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all the things that [were] therein and sanctified them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him, to sanctify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Moses brought Aaron's sons and put coats upon them and girded them with girdles and put tiaras upon them, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Next he brought the bullock of the sin, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he slew [it]; and Moses took the blood and put [it] upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and removed the sin from the altar and poured the [remaining] blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After that he took all the fat that [was] upon the intestines and the caul [above] the liver and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses incensed [it][ upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the bullock and its hide, its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>After that, he brought the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he killed [it]; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he cut the ram into pieces, and Moses incensed the head and the pieces and the fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he washed the intestines and the legs in water, and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar; it [was] a burnt sacrifice in a very acceptable aroma, an offering on fire unto the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After that, he brought the other ram, the ram of the consecrations, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he slew [it]; and Moses took of the blood of it and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ears and upon the thumbs of their right hands and upon the great toes of their right feet; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and after that, he took the fat and the tail, and all the fat that [was] upon the intestines and the caul [above] the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat and the right shoulder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and out of the basket of unleavened bread that [was] before the LORD he took one unleavened cake and a cake of oiled bread and one wafer and put [them] with the fat and with the right shoulder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he put all of it in Aaron's hands and in his sons' hands and caused them to be waved [for] a wave offering before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After that Moses took them from their hands and incensed [them] on the altar upon the burnt offering; they [are] the consecrations in a very acceptable aroma, an offering on fire unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses took the breast and waved it [for a wave offering before the LORD; [for] of the ram of the consecrations this was Moses' part, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which [was] upon the altar and sprinkled [it] upon Aaron [and] upon his garments and upon his sons and upon his sons' garments with him and sanctified Aaron [and] his garments, and his sons and his sons' garments with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Cook the flesh [at] the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and eat it there with the bread that [is] in the basket of the consecrations, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread ye shall burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the testimony [in] seven days, until the day that the days of your consecration are fulfilled; because for seven days ye shall be consecrated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As has been done this day, so the LORD has commanded to do, to reconcile you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore shall ye abide [at] the door of the tabernacle of the testimony day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not; for so I am commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
