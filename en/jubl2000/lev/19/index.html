I AM your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do not return unto idols nor make to yourselves molten gods. I AM your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace unto the LORD, ye shall offer it of your own free will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it and on the next day, and any remaining until the third day shall be burnt in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it [is] abominable; it shall not be accepted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and whoever eats it shall bear his iniquity because he has profaned the holiness of the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not completely reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen grapes of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and the stranger.
