neither fence in the grapes of thy consecrated vine; [for] it is a year of rest unto the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the sabbath of the land shall be food for you, for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourns with thee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and for thy beast and for the animals that [are] in thy land shall all the fruit thereof be food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty-nine years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shalt thou cause the shofar to [sound] an alarm on the tenth [day] of the seventh month; in the day of the reconciliations shall ye cause the shofar to sound throughout all your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye shall sanctify the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every one unto his possession, and ye shall return each one unto his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you; ye shall not sow nor reap that which grows of itself in it nor fence in thy consecrated vine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it [is] the jubilee; it shall be holy unto you; ye shall eat the fruit of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In this year of jubilee ye shall return each one unto his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if thou sell anything unto thy neighbour or buy [anything] of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, [and] according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for [according] to the number [of the years] of the fruits does he sell unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God; for I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Execute, therefore, my statutes and keep my rights and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow nor gather in our fruits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall sow the eighth year and eat [yet] of old fruit; until the ninth year, until her fruits come in ye shall eat [of] the old [store].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land [is] mine; for ye [are] strangers and sojourners with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, in all the land of your possession, ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If thy brother becomes poor and has sold away [some] of his possession, his redeemer shall come, his closest [kinsman], and shall redeem that which his brother sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the man has no redeemer and is able to stretch forth his hand and find enough for his redemption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then he shall count the years from the sale thereof and pay that which remains unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if he is not able to stretch forth his hand and find enough to return unto it, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of the one that has bought it until the year of jubilee;

[within] a full year may he redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to the one that bought it for his descendants; it shall not go out in the jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites [and] the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a man [makes a] purchase from the Levites, then the house that was sold and the city of his possession, shall go out in [the year of] jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites [are] their possession among the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it [is] their perpetual possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if thy brother becomes poor and comes unto thee, then thou shalt receive him; as a stranger, or a sojourner, he shall live with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Take thou no usury of him, or increase; but thou shalt have the fear of thy God, and thy brother shall live with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy food for increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I AM your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan [and] to be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when thy brother becomes poor, [being] with thee, and if he should sell himself unto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serve as a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As a hired servant [and] as a sojourner, he shall be with thee [and] shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he shall depart [free] from thy house, [both] he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he be restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For they belong to me, I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, [shall be] of the Gentiles that are round about you; of them shall ye buy slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Ye may also buy of the children of the strangers that live among you and of those of their lineage that are born in your land, who [are] with you, and they shall be your possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And ye shall possess them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit as a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever; but over your brethren, the sons of Israel, ye shall not rule over one another with rigor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if a sojourner or stranger who is with thee becomes rich and thy brother who is with him becomes poor and sells himself unto the stranger [or] sojourner who is with thee or to the race of the lineage of the stranger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>after he is sold he shall have redemption; one of his brethren shall redeem him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>either his uncle or his uncle's son shall redeem him; or [any] that is near of kin unto him of his lineage shall redeem him; or if he is able, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If [there are] yet many years, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, [and] according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>[And] as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him; [and the other] shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if he is not redeemed in these [years], then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, [both] he and his children with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For the sons of Israel [are] mine; they [are] my slaves whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. I AM your God.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
