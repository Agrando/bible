and a present mingled with oil; for today the LORD will appear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the testimony, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do, and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin, and thy burnt offering, and make reconciliation for thyself and for the people; and offer the offering of the people and make reconciliation for them, as the LORD commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Aaron went unto the altar and slew the calf of his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put [it] upon the horns of the altar and poured out the [remaining] blood at the bottom of the altar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the fat and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin, he incensed upon the altar, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Likewise he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After that they presented the burnt offering unto him, by its pieces, and the head; and he incensed [them] upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he washed the intestines and the legs and burnt [them] with the burnt offering on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He also offered the people's offering and took the he goat, which [was] the sin of the people, and slew it and offered it for [their] sin, as the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Likewise he offered the present and took a handful thereof and incensed [it] upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He also slew the bullock and the ram in sacrifice of peace, which [was] for the people; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood (which he sprinkled upon the altar round about)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the tail and that which covers [the inwards] and the kidneys and the caul [above] the liver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the breasts, with the right shoulder, Aaron waved, waving them before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After that, Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering the sin and the burnt offering and the peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony and came out and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there came a fire out from before the LORD and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat, [which] when all the people saw, they praised and fell on their faces.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
