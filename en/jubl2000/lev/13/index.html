and the priest shall recognize him and pronounce him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If the bright spot [is] white in the skin of his flesh and looks to be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof is not turned white; then the priest shall shut up [the one that has] the plague seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the priest shall look on him the seventh day and see [if] the plague in his sight is stayed [and] the plague is not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days the second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After this the priest shall look on him again the seventh day and see [if] the plague [has] darkened [and] that the plague is not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it [is but] a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the scab spreads much abroad in the skin after he has been shown unto the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and [if] the priest recognizes that the scab has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the priest shall see [him]; and [if] the rising looks white in the skin and it has turned the hair white and [there is] quick raw flesh in the rising,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>it [is] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean and shall not shut him up, for he [is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if the leprosy breaks out abroad in the skin and the leprosy covers all the skin of [him that has] the plague from his head even to his feet whereever the priest looks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>then the priest shall consider; and if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [the one] that has the plague clean; it is all turned white; he [is] clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the day that raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the priest shall see the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean, [for] the raw flesh [is] unclean: it [is] leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when the raw flesh turns again and is changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the priest shall see him; and if the plague is turned white; then the priest shall pronounce [the one] that has the plague clean, and he [shall be] clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when in the flesh, in the skin thereof, there was a boil and is healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and in the place of the boil there is a white rising or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, it shall be shown to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the priest shall look, and if it appears to be lower than the skin and the hair thereof is turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it [is] a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the priest considers it and there appear to be no white hairs in it and it [is not lower than the skin, but somewhat dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and if it spreads much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if the bright spot stays in its place [and] does not spread, it [is] the scab of a boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Likewise when the flesh has in its skin a burn from fire, and in the place healed from the burn there a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then the priest shall look upon it; and [if] the hair in the bright spot is turned white and it looks deeper than the skin, it [is] a leprosy broken out of the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it [is] the plague of leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the priest looks on it and there is no white hair in the bright spot and it [is] no lower than the [other] skin, but dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the priest shall recognize it the seventh day; [and] if it is spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if the bright spot stays in its place [and] has not spread in the skin, but it is dark, it [is] a rising of the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it [is] an inflammation of the burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If a man or woman has a plague upon the head or the beard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>then the priest shall see the plague; and if it looks deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellowish and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it [is] a dry scall, leprosy of the head or beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But when the priest looks on the plague of the scall and if it does not look deeper than the skin and [there is] no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up [the one] that has the plague of the scall seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and [if] the scall appears not to have spread and there is no yellowish hair in it and the scall appears not to be deeper than the skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he shall be shaven, but the [place of the] scall he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up [the one that has] the scall for seven days the second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and [if] the scall is not spread in the skin nor in appearance deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if the scall spreads much in the skin after his cleansing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then the priest shall look at it; and if the scall is spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellowish hair; he [is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if the scall appears to him to be stayed and there is black hair grown up in it, the scall is healed; he [is] clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Likewise if a man or a woman has in the skin of their flesh bright spots, [even] white bright spots,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>the the priest shall look; and if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh [are] darkish white, it is a freckled spot [that] grew in the skin; the [person is] clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the man whose hair has fallen off his head is bald; [yet] he [is] clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if his hair has fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he [is] forehead bald; [yet is] he clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But if in the bald head, or bald forehead, there is a white reddish sore, it [is] a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the priest shall look upon it; and if the rising of the sore [is] white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he is a leprous man, he [is] unclean; the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague [is] in his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the leper in whom the plague [is], his clothes shall be rent and his head uncovered, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>All the days in which the plague [shall be] in him he shall be defiled; he [shall be] unclean; he shall dwell alone; outside the camp [shall] his habitation [be].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, [whether it is] a woolen garment or a linen garment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>whether [it is] in the warp or woof; of linen or of woolen; whether in a skin or in anything made of skin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin, either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin, it [is] a plague of leprosy and shall be shown unto the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the priest shall look upon the plague and shut up [the thing that has] the plague seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day; if the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof or in a skin [or] in any work that is made of skins; the plague [is] a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the plague is; for it [is] a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And if the priest shall look and it appears that the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>then the priest shall command that they wash [the thing] in which the plague [is], and he shall shut it up again for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the priest shall look on it after the plague has been washed; and if it appears that the plague has not changed its colour, even if the plague is not spread, it [is] unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it [is] fret inward, [whether] the bare [spot] is within or without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And if the priest looks and the plague appears to be darker after the washing of it, then he shall cut it out of the garment or out of the skin or out of the warp or out of the woof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof or in anything of skin, springing up again in it, thou shalt burn whatever the plague [is] in with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But the garment, either warp or woof or whatever thing of skin which thou shalt wash and from which the plague is removed, shall be washed [the] second time, and then it shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This [is] the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp or woof or anything of skins, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
