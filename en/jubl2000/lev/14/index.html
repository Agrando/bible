and if the plague has spread in the walls of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>then the priest shall command that they remove the stones in which the plague [is], and they shall cast them outside the city into an unclean place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off outside the city into an unclean place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they shall take other stones and put [them] in the place of the stones [that were removed]; and he shall take other mortar and shall plaster the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if the plague comes again and breaks out in the house after he has taken away the stones and after he has scraped the house and after it is plastered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>then the priest shall come in and look; and if the plague appears to have spread in the house, it [is] a fretting leprosy in the house; it [is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he shall break down the house, its stones, and its timbers, and all the mortar of the house;
