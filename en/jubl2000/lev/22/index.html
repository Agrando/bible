I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Say unto them, Any man of all your seed among your generations that goes in unto the holy things, which the children of Israel sanctify unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whatever man of the seed of Aaron who [is] a leper or has a running issue shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whosoever touches any thing [that is] unclean [by] the dead or a man whose seed has gone out from him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>or the man who has touched any reptile, by which he shall be unclean, or a man of whom he shall become unclean, according to whatever uncleanness he has,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>the person who has touched any such shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the holy things until he has washed his flesh with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the sun is down, he shall be clean and shall afterward eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That which dies of itself or is torn [by beasts], he shall not eat to defile himself therewith. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall therefore keep my ordinance lest they bear sin for it and die therefore, if they profane it.
