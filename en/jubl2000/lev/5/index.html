and the priest shall reconcile him from his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if he is not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for the guilt of his sin two turtledoves or two young pigeons unto the LORD, one for his sin and the other for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer [that] which [is] for the sin first and wring off its head from its neck but shall not divide [it] asunder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar; it [is] sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he shall offer the second [for] a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and [thus] shall the priest reconcile him for his sin in which he has sinned, and he shall have forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if he is not able to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for his sin; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put [any] frankincense thereon, for it is sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, [even] a memorial thereof, and incense [it] on the altar upon the [other] offerings on fire unto the LORD; it [is] sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>[Thus] shall the priest reconcile him from his sin in which he has sinned in one of these things, and he shall have forgiveness; and [that which remains] shall be the priest's, as [with] a present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD spoke further unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When [any] person commits a trespass and sins through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring for [the expiation of] his guilt unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, in thy estimation of [two] shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for his guilt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall pay for the sin that he has done in the holy thing and shall add the fifth part thereto and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall reconcile him with the ram of [the expiation of] his guilt, and he shall have forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Finally, if a person commits a sin by doing any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD, without doing it knowingly, he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, in thy estimation, for [the expiation of] his guilt, unto the priest; and the priest shall reconcile him from his error which he committed in ignorance, and he shall have forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is for his guilt; he is certainly guilty against the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
