As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abides in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I AM the vine, ye [are] the branches: he that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who does not abide in me shall be cast forth as an [unsound] branch and shall wither, and they are gathered and cast into the fire and are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In this is my Father clarified, in that ye bear much fruit; and in this manner ye shall be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things I have spoken unto you that my joy may abide in you and [that] your joy might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his soul for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From now on I do not call you servants, for the servant does not know what his lord does; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain; that whatever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it [unto] you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This I command you, that ye love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hates you, ye know that it hated me before [it hated] you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.
