They said unto him, Let us also go with thee. They went forth and entered into a ship immediately, and that night they caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not understand that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Children, have ye any food? They answered him, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right hand side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt [his] fisher's coat [unto him] (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the other disciples came in the [little] ship (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits), dragging the net with [the] fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three; and being so many, yet the net was not broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus said unto them, Come [and] dine. And none of the disciples dared to ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus then came and took the bread and gave them, and the fish likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This [was] now the third time that Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him, Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him, Feed my lambs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to him again the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He said unto him, Yes, Lord thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him, Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said unto him, Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself and walk where thou wouldest, but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and carry [thee] where thou wouldest not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This he spoke, signifying by what death he should clarify God. And when he had spoken this, he said unto him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what [shall] this man [do]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said unto him, If I will that he tarry until I come, what [is that] to thee? follow thou me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then this saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die; yet Jesus did not say unto him, He shall not die, but, If I will that he tarry until I come, what [is that] to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I think that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
