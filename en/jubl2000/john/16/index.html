And I did not say these things unto you at the beginning because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go unto him that sent me, and none of you asks me, Where goest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of sin, because they do not believe in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth, for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak, and he will cause you to know the things which are to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shall clarify me, for he shall take of that which is mine and shall cause you to know [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he shall take of that which is mine and shall cause you to know [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then [some] of his disciples said among themselves, What is this that he says unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while, and ye shall see me; and, Because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore, What is this that he says, A little while? we cannot understand what he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of what I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, and the world shall rejoice; but even though ye shall be sorrowful, your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The woman, when she is in travail, has pain, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers the anguish no more, for joy that a man is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye now therefore have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and no one shall take your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now ye have asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have spoken these things unto you in proverbs, but the hour comes when I shall no longer speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day ye shall ask in my name, and I do not say unto you that I will ask the Father for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loves you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came out from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father and am come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said unto him, Behold, now thou speakest plainly and speakest no proverb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we understand that thou knowest all things and needest not that anyone should ask thee; by this we believe that thou didst come forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the hour comes and is now come, that ye shall be scattered, each one to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
