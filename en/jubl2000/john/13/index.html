Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and [my] head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs only to wash [his] feet because he is completely clean, and ye are clean, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew who should betray him; therefore, said he, Ye are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and had sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well, for [so] I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, the Lord and the Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If ye know these things, ye shall be blessed if ye do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen; but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>now I tell you before it is done, so that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit and testified and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was seated at the table beside Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to this one that he should ask him who it was of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He then, reclining [on] Jesus' breast, said unto him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, He it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped [it]. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said unto him, That which thou shalt do, do it more quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now no one at the table understood for what purpose he spoke this unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some [of them] thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy [those things] that we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He then having received the sop went immediately out, and it was [now] night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man clarified, and God is clarified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God is clarified in him, God shall also clarify him in himself and shall straightway clarify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; and as I said unto the Jews, Where I go, ye cannot come, so now I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall everyone know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, where goest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my soul for thy sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy soul for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow until thou hast denied me three times.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
