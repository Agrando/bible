Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to those that were sitting down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore they gathered [them] together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over from those that had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then those men, as they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth the prophet that was to come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus therefore knowing that they would come and take him by force to make him king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when evening was come, his disciples went down unto the sea</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and entered into a ship and were crossing the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship, and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said unto them, I AM; be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they willingly received him into the ship, and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The day following when the multitude which was on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one in which his disciples had entered and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples had gone away alone</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(but other boats came from Tiberias near unto the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into the boats and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when didst thou come here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye have seen the signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Labour not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you, for him has God the Father sealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they said unto him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he has sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They said therefore unto him, What sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers ate manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them [of] the bread from the heaven to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from the heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is he who descended from heaven and gives life unto the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said they unto him, Lord, always give us this bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus said unto them, I AM the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes in me shall never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I said unto you, That even though ye have seen me, ye do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and he that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I came down from the heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this is the Father's will who has sent me, that of all whom he has given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And this is the will of him that sent me, That every one who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews then murmured of him because he said, I AM the bread which descended from the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that he says, I descended from heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No one can come to me unless the Father who has sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard from the Father and has learned comes unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is of God, he has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believes in me has eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I AM the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness and are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I AM the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, they shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How is he able to give us [his] flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye shall have no life in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Whosoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eats me, he shall also live by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate manna and are dead; he that eats of this bread shall live eternally.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>He said these things in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many therefore of his disciples when they had heard [this] said, This is a hard word; who can hear it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said unto them, Does this offend you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>[What] if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The Spirit is he that gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken unto you, [they] are Spirit and [they] are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you that do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe and who should betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And he said, Therefore I said unto you that no one can come unto me unless it is given unto them of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>After this, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then Jesus said unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And we believe and know that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He spoke of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon, for it was he that should betray him, being one of the twelve.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
