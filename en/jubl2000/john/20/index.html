She said unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing [there] and did not know that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said unto her, Woman, why dost thou weep? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said unto him, Lord, if thou didst carry him off, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said unto her, Mary! Turning herself around, she said unto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said unto her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene came giving the news to the disciples, That I have seen the Lord, and he spoke these things unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the same day at evening, being the first of the sabbaths, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having said this, he showed them [his] hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus said to them again, Peace [be] unto you; as [my] Father has sent me, even so send I you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, he breathed on [them] and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>unto those whose sins ye release, they shall be released; [and] unto those whose [sins] ye retain, they shall be retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples, therefore, said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Unless I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And again eight days later, his disciples were within and Thomas with them; [then] Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace [be] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to Thomas, Reach here thy finger and behold my hands and reach here thy hand and thrust [it] into my side and be not unbelieving, but faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed [are] those that have not seen and [yet] have believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus truly did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
