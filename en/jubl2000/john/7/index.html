If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For not even his brethren believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go ye up unto this feast; I go not up yet unto this feast, for my time is not yet fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And having said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brethren were gone up, then he also went up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Jews sought him at the feast and said, Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him, for some said, He is [a] good [man]; others said, No, but he deceives the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How does this man know letters, having never learned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone desires to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God or [whether] I speak of myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keeps the law? Why do ye go about to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered and said, Thou hast a demon; who goes about to kill thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man on the sabbath day receives circumcision without the law of Moses being broken, are ye angry at me because I have made a man entirely whole on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge [with] righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then one of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, behold, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Have the rulers truly understood that this is indeed the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we know where this man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one shall know where he is from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus cried out in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye know me, and ye know from where I come, but I have not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know him, for I am from him, and he has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to take him, but no one laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And many of the people believed in him and said, When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than these which this [man] has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the people that murmured such things concerning him, and the princes of the priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while I shall be with you, and [then] I shall go unto him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye shall seek me and shall not find [me], and where I shall be, ye shall not be able to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then the Jews said among themselves, Where will he go that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What [manner of] saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me and shall not find [me], and where I shall be ye shall not be able to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If any man thirsts, let him come unto me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>(But this he spoke concerning the Spirit, which those that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet [given] because Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then many of the people, when they heard this word, said, Truly this is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall the Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has not the scripture said, That the Christ comes of the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division among the people because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them would have taken him, but no one laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees came, and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, Never has anyone spoken like this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the Pharisees answered them, Are ye also deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the princes or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this people who do not know the law are cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus said unto them (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Does our law judge [any] man before it hears him and knows what he does?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and see, for a prophet has never arisen out of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And each [one] went unto his own house.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
