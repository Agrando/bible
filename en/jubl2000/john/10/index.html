I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them said, He has a demon and is beside himself; why do ye hear him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not the words of him that has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they celebrated the dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Jews came round about him and said unto him, Until when wilt thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, I have told you, and ye do not believe; the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall anyone pluck them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who gave [them to] me, is greater than all; and no one is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and [my] Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we do not stone thee, but for blasphemy; and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do, though ye do not believe me, believe the works that ye may know and believe that the Father [is] in me and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they sought again to take him, but he escaped out of their hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized, and there he abode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came unto him and said, John certainly did no sign, but all [the] things that John spoke of this man were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed in him there.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
