Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Unless a man is born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind blows where it desires, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell from where it comes or where it goes; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can this be done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily, verily, I say unto thee that we speak what we know and testify that which we have seen, and ye do not receive our witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things and ye do not believe, how shall ye believe if I tell you [of] heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no one has ascended up to the heaven but he that came down from the heaven, [even] the Son of man, who is in the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that believes on him is not condemned, but he that does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the condemnation, that the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness more than the light because their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea, and he tarried there with them and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim because there was much water there, and they came and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John was not yet cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then there arose a question between the disciples of John and the Jews about purifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came unto John and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan of whom thou gave witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all [men] come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing except it is given him from the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye yourselves are my witnesses that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice; this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It is expedient [unto] him to increase, but [unto] me, to decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He that comes from above is above all; he that is of the earth is earthly and speaks earthly things: he that comes from heaven is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God does not give the Spirit by measure [unto him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He that believes in the Son has eternal life, and he that does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
