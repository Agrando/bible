Father, save me from this hour, but for this have I come in this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, clarify thy name. Then there came a voice from the heaven, [saying], I have clarified it and will clarify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The people, therefore, that were present and heard [it], said that it thundered; others said, An angel spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou, It is expedient that the Son of man be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the Light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you; for he that walks in darkness does not know where he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While ye have the Light, believe in the Light that ye may be the sons of light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But although he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who shall believe our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should not see with [their] eyes nor understand with [their] heart and be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless, even among the princes many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Jesus cried and said, He that believes in me, believes not in me, but in him that sent me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and he that sees me sees him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I am come [as] a light into the world that whosoever believes in me should not abide in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if anyone hears my words and believes not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the world but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that rejects me and does not receive my words has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is eternal life; whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
