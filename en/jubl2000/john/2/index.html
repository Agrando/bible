My hour is not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother said unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the butler. And they bore [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the butler had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not where it was [from] (but the servants who drew the water knew), the butler called the bridegroom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said unto him, Every man at the beginning sets forth the good wine, and when they are well satisfied, then that which is worse; [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples, and they continued there not many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers' money and overthrew the tables</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said unto those that sold the doves, Take these things away from here; do not make my Father's house a house of merchandise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house has consumed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Jews answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, Dissolve this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said the Jews, This temple was forty-six years in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore when he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, seeing the signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jesus did not trust himself unto them because he knew all [men]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and needed not that any man should give testimony, for he knew what was in man.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
