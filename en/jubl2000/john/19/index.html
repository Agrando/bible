And [Pilate] said unto them, Behold the man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the princes of the priests and the servants saw him, they cried out, saying, crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said unto them, Take him, and crucify him, for I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore when Pilate heard that word, he was the more afraid</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and went again into the judgement hall and said unto Jesus, Where art thou from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Pilate said unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to hang thee on a stake and have power to release thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, Thou could have no power [at all] against me, unless it were given thee from above; therefore he that delivered me unto thee has the greater sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend; whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore when Pilate heard that word, he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgement seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour; then he said unto the Jews, Behold your King!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him. Pilate said unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The high priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So that then, he delivered him unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led [him] away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he, bearing his stake, went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified him and two others with him, one on either side and Jesus in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate also wrote a title and put [it] above the stake. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city; and it was written in Hebrew [and] Greek [and] Latin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews, but that he said, I AM King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts (to each soldier a part); and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them, and for my raiment they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there stood by the stake of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own [home].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar, and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put [it] upon hyssop and put [it] to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and he bowed his head and gave the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the stake on the sabbath day (for that sabbath day was a high day) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and [that] they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who were crucified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already, they did not break his legs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith blood and water came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he that saw [it] gives testimony, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he says [the] truth, that ye also might believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Nicodemus came also, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as is the manner of the Jews to bury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which no one had yet been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore they laid Jesus there because of the Jews' preparation [day], for the sepulchre was near.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
