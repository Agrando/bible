Art thou Elijah? And he said, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And those who were sent were of the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him and said unto him, Why dost thou baptize then if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there stands one among you, whom ye know not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him and said, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John gave testimony, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, the same is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I have seen and have given testimony that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And again the next day John stood, and two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak and followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where dwellest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He said unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two who heard John [speak] and followed him was Andrew, brother of Simon Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first found his own brother Simon and said unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The day following Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee and found Philip and said unto him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip found Nathanael and said unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, Behold a true Israelite, in whom is no guile!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael said unto him, From where dost thou know me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
