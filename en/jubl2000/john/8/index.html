But Jesus stooped down and with [his] finger wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him [be] the first to cast a stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest [even] unto the last; and Jesus was left alone and the woman that had been in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman, said unto her, Woman, where are thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she said, No one, Lord. Then Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jesus spoke again unto them, saying, I AM the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the Pharisees said unto him, Thou dost bear witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear witness of myself, my witness is true, for I know from where I came and where I go; but ye do not know where I came from and where I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye judge after the flesh, but I judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I AM one that bears witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they said unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father; if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus spoke these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no one laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus said again unto them, I [am] going away, and ye shall seek me, but ye shall die in your sins; where I go, ye shall not be able to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? because he says, Where I go, ye shall not be able to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto them, Ye are from below, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I said unto you that ye shall die in your sins, for if ye do not believe that I AM, ye shall die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And said they unto him, Who art thou? Then Jesus said unto them, He that I said unto you also from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say and to judge regarding you, but he that sent me is true; and those things which I have heard of him, I speak in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But they did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus said unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I AM and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone, for I always do those things that please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spoke these words, many believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye shall be my disciples indeed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and we have never served anyone; how sayest thou, Ye shall be set free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the servant does not abide in the house for ever, [but] the Son abides for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If the Son therefore shall set you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that ye are Abraham's seed, but ye seek to kill me because my word has no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said unto them, If ye were Abraham's sons, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God; Abraham did not [do] this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then they said to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would surely love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither did I come of myself, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the desires of your father ye desire to do. He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And because I tell [you] the truth, ye do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you reproves me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He that is of God hears God's words; ye therefore hear [them] not because ye are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the Jews answered, and said unto him, Do we not say well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeks it and judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If anyone keeps my word, he shall not see death forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then the Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keeps my word, he shall not taste death forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham who died? and the prophets died; whom makest thou thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father that glorifies me, of whom ye say that he is your God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>yet ye have not known him, but I know him; and if I should say, I do not know him, I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know him and keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw [it] and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then the Jews said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then they took up stones to cast at him, but Jesus concealed himself and went out of the temple, and going through the midst of them, went away.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
