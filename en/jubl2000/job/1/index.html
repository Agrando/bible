Thus did Job continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Where dost thou come from? Then Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and has departed from evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Satan answered the LORD and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he has on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands; therefore, his substance has increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he has, [and thou shalt see] if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has [is] in thy power; only upon himself do not put forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and a messenger came unto Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the Sabeans fell [upon them] and took them away; they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he [was] yet speaking, another came who said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he [was] yet speaking, another came and said, The Chaldeans made three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he [was] yet speaking, there another came and said, Thy sons and thy daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with folly.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
