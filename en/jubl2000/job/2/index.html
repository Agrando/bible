And Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and has departed from evil and that he still retains his perfection, although thou didst incite me against him to destroy him without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Satan answered the LORD and said, Skin for skin, all that a man has he will give for his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, [and thou shalt see] if he does not blaspheme thee to thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he [is] in thy hand, but preserve his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took a potsherd to scratch himself with, and he was sitting among the ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then his wife said unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?

Shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now three friends of Job, Eliphaz, the Temanite, Bildad, the Shuhite, and Zophar, the Naamathite, [when] they heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each one came from his own place; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not, they lifted up their voice and wept; and each one rent his mantle and sprinkled dust upon his head toward heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word unto him; for they saw that [his] grief was very great.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
