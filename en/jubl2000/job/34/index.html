And who set the whole world in order?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he were to set his heart upon man and gather unto himself his spirit and his breath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again unto dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall even he that hates judgment govern? And wilt thou condemn the Mighty One that is righteous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[Is it fit] to say to the king, [Thou art of] Belial [and] to the princes, Ye [are] ungodly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[How much less to him] who is not a respecter of the persons of princes, nor respects the rich more than the poor; for they all [are] the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment they shall die, and the peoples shall be troubled at midnight and shall pass away; and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he sees all his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[There is] no darkness nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he will not lay upon man more [than that which is just]; that he should enter into judgment with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set others in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, he shall cause their works to be notorious, when he shall overturn [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He shall strike them as wicked men in the open sight of others</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because thus they turned back from him and would not consider any of his ways</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he gives rest, who then can make trouble? If he hides [his] face, who then can behold him? This applies to a nation and the same to a man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that the hypocrite not reign, lest the people be ensnared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For it is of God to say, I have forgiven, I will no longer destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Teach me that which I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Will he, perchance finish his work by thee; whether thou refuse or whether thou choose, or by me? Speak what thou knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The men of understanding will say as I [say], and the wise man will hearken unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without prudence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>My desire [is that] Job may be tried unto the end, that there may be answers against wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he added rebellion unto his sin, he claps [his hands] among us and multiplies his words against God.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
