For he that is wise is profitable unto himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>[Is it] any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art justified? Or [is it] gain [to him] that thou makest thy ways perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will he reprove thee or will he enter with thee into judgment because he fears thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Certainly thy wickedness is great and thine iniquities have no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thou didst take a pledge from thy brother without cause and stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou didst not give water to drink to the weary, and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the man of means had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou hast sent the widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, snares [are] round about thee, and sudden fear troubles thee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>or darkness, [that] thou canst not see, and abundance of waters cover thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>[Is] not God in the height of the heavens?
