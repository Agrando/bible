And it would be unto you [instead of] wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hear now my dispute, and hearken to the arguments of my lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Are ye to speak iniquity for God? Are ye to speak deceitfully for him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Are ye to bring honour unto him? Are ye to contend for God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Would it be good for him to search you out? As one man mocks another, do ye [so] mock him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He will reprove you severely, if in secret you give him such honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Certainly his excellency should make you afraid, and his dread should fall upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Your memories shall be compared unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Listen to me, and I will speak, and afterward let come on me what [will].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why shall I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in the palm of my [hand]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though he slay me, yet I will trust in him; but I will defend my ways before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He also [shall be] my saving health; for the hypocrite shall not enter into his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hear diligently my reason and my declaration with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold now, if I draw near unto the judgment; I know that I shall be justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who [is] he [that] will contend with me?
