Behold, for your iniquities ye are sold, and for your rebellions was your mother put away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>for I came, and no one showed himself; I called, and no one answered. Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink because [there is] no water and die for thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the wise that I should know how to speak a word in season to [him that is] weary; he wakes up early, early shall he awaken [my] ear, that I might hear, as the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to those that plucked off the hair: I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore, I was not ashamed; therefore, I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together; who [is] my adversary? let him come near to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who [is] he [that] shall condemn me? behold, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who [is] among you that fears the LORD?
