They have forsaken the LORD; they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger; they have turned back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why should I chastise you any more? Ye will revolt more and more; every head is sick, and every heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even unto the head [there is] no soundness in him; [but] wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country [is] desolate; your cities [are] burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Except the LORD of the hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, [and] we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of the LORD, ye princes of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? shall the LORD say. I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain oblations; the incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot stand them; iniquity and the solemn meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; likewise, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>learn to do good; seek judgment; restore unto the oppressed; hear the fatherless in right [judgment]; protect the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then come, shall the LORD say, and we shall be even; if your sins were as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow; if they were red like crimson, they shall become as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye are willing and hearken, ye shall eat the good of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How is the faithful city become a harlot! It was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thy princes [are] rebellious and companions of thieves; every one loves bribes and follows after rewards; they do not hear the fatherless in judgment, neither does the cause of the widow come unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of the hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries and avenge myself of my enemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I will turn my hand upon thee and according to pureness purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning; afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be ransomed with judgment and her converts with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together, and those that forsook the LORD shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For ye shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the groves that ye have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf falls and as a garden that has no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong [idol] shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and no one [shall be able to] quench [them].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
