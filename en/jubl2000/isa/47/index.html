Until now thou hast not laid these [things] to heart, neither didst thou remember thy latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore now hear this, [thou] delicate one, that dost sit in confidence and say in thine heart, I [am], and no one else beside me; I shall not sit [as] a widow, neither shall I be fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But these two [things] shall come to thee in a moment in one day; the loss of thy fathers and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries [and] for the great abundance of thine enchantments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, No one sees me. Thy wisdom and thine [own] knowledge; it has deceived thee; for thou hast said in thine heart, I [am], and no one else beside me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from where it rises; and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and destruction shall come upon thee suddenly, [which] thou shalt not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries in which thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to better thyself, if so be thou may prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now those that contemplate the heavens, those that speculate regarding the stars, those that teach the courses of the moon, stand up and defend thee from [these things] that shall come upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver their lives from the hand of the flame; [there shall] not be a coal left to warm at, [nor] light to sit before it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, [even] thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander each one to his own way; there [shall be] no one to save thee.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
