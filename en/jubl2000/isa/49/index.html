But [if] Israel will not be gathered, even so, yet I shall be esteemed in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, It is a light thing that thou should be my servant to wake up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the desolations of Israel; I have also given thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou may be my saving health unto the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus has the LORD said, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the Gentiles abhor, to the servant of the tyrants, Kings shall see and be raised up as princes and shall worship because of the LORD, for faithful is the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus has the LORD said, In an acceptable time I have heard thee, and in the day of saving health I have helped thee; and I will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of people, that thou might awaken the earth, that thou might inherit [the] desolate heritages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that thou may say to the prisoners, Go forth; and unto those that [are] in darkness, Show yourselves. Upon the ways shall they be fed, and upon all the high places [shall be] their pastures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall never hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water he shall feed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will turn all my mountains [into] a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these shall come from far; and, behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Even though they may forget, I will not forget thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] hands; thy walls are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thy builders shall come in haste; thy destroyers and those that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, [and] come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thyself with them all, as with a garment of honour and shalt be girded by them as a bride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and those that destroyed thee shall be separated far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Even thy sons which were fatherless, shall say in thine ears, The place [is] too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who has begotten me these, seeing I had lost my children and [was] desolate, a stranger removed from my land? and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where [had] they [been]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus has the Lord GOD said, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles and raise up my banner [as an example] to the peoples: and they shall bring thy sons in [their] arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon [their] shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their princesses thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with [their] face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD: for those that wait for me shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contends with thee, and I will save thy sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will feed those that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD [am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
