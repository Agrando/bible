nor his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid [his] face from you, that he will not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips pronounce lies; your tongue speaks evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>No one calls for righteousness, nor [do any] judge by the truth; they trust in vanity, and speak vanities; they conceive trouble and bring forth iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They hatch cockatrice' eggs and weave the spider's web; whosoever shall eat of their eggs shall die, and if they should squeeze them, a viper shall come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Their cloth is unfit to be a garment, neither shall they cover themselves with their works; their works [are] works of violence, and the work of iniquity is in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts [are] thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are their paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The way of peace they did not know; nor is there anything straight about their ways; they have wilfully made themselves crooked paths; whosoever goes therein shall not know peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore judgment has withdrawn from us, and righteousness has never overtaken us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, [but] we walk in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We grope for the wall like the blind, and as if [we had] no eyes we walk by touch; we stumble at noonday as in the night; [we are] in graves as dead [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We all roar like bears and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but [there is] none; for saving health, [but] it has withdrawn from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our rebellions are multiplied before thee, and our sins have testified against us; for our iniquities [are] with us; and we know our sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>To rebel and to lie against the LORD, and to depart away from our God; the speaking of libel and rebellion, to conceive, and to speak from the heart words of falsehood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and that which is right has departed, and righteousness withdrew afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity could not enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the truth was taken captive; and he [that] departed from evil [was] imprisoned: and the LORD saw [it], and it was displeasing in his eyes because that which is right was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saw that [there was] no man and wondered that [there was] no intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation unto him, and his righteousness, it sustained him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a helmet of saving health upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance [for] clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so as to give payment, so as to repay the vengeance of his enemies, and repay his adversaries; to the islands he will give recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he shall come like a violent river impelled by the breath of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto those that turn from the rebellion in Jacob, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this shall be my covenant with them, said the LORD; My spirit that [is] upon thee, and my words, which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from now one and for ever.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
