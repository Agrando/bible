And he camped by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the washer's field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the writer of chronicles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence [is] this in which thou dost trust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say, [sayest thou], (but [they are but] vain words) [I have] counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust that thou dost rebel against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, thou dost trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt upon which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it, so [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God; [is it] not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou art able on thy part to set riders upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How, therefore, wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants even if thou art trusting in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And peradventure am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? The LORD said unto me, Go up against this land and destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand [it], and do not speak to us in the Jewish language, in the ears of the people that [are] on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? [Has he] not [sent me] to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus saith the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not hearken unto Hezekiah, for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make peace with me and come out to me and eat each one of his vine and each one of his fig tree and drink each one the waters of his own cistern</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[Beware] lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the Gentiles delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where [is] the god of Hamath and Arphad? Where [is] the god of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>What god is there among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they held their peace and did not answer him a word, for the king had commanded thus, saying, Answer him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[Then] came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah, the son of Asaph, the writer of chronicles, to Hezekiah with [their] clothes rent and told him the words of Rabshakeh.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
