They have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because I called, and no one answered; I spoke, and they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes and chose that which displeased [me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hate you, that deny you for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified; but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A voice of noise from the city, [a] voice of the temple, [a] voice of the LORD that renders recompense to his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth bring forth in one day? Shall an [entire] nation be born at once? that Zion travailed, and shall bring forth her sons together?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I, who make births [to happen], shall I not be with child? saith the LORD; I, who cause conception, shall I be stopped? saith thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: be filled with joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the splendour of her glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream; then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon [her] sides, and be dandled upon [her] knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As a manchild whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ye shall see, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like grass; and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants and [his] indignation toward his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, behold, the LORD will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For by fire and by his sword will the LORD judge all flesh; and the slain of the LORD shall be multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Those that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, one behind another; those that eat swine's flesh and abomination, and the mouse shall be cut off together, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I [understand] their works and their thoughts. [The time] shall come to gather all the Gentiles and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the Gentiles, [to] Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, [to] Tubal, and Javan, [to] the isles afar off, that have never heard my name, nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they shall bring all your brethren [for] an offering unto the LORD from among all the Gentiles, upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon camels to my holy mountain of Jerusalem, saith the LORD, so that the sons of Israel bring the offering in clean vessels to the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will also take of them for priests [and] for Levites, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall come to pass [that] from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another all flesh shall come to worship before me, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that rebelled against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
