for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the Gentiles shall walk to thy light, and the kings to the brightness of thy birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lift up thine eyes round about and see: they all gather themselves together; they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at [thy] side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then thou shalt see, and thou shall shine, and thine heart shall marvel, and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the strength of the Gentiles shall have come unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, rams of Nebaioth shall be served unto thee: they shall be offered up with grace upon my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who [are] these [that] fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish from the first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall serve thee; for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my good favour I shall have mercy on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that the strength of the Gentiles may be brought unto thee, and their kings guided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the people or the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish and shall be utterly wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will honour the place of my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sons also of those that afflicted thee shall come humbled unto thee; and at the steps of thy feet all those that despised thee shall bow themselves down; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through [thee], I will place thee in eternal glory, in joy from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of the kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD [am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for the stones iron; I will also put peace [in the place of] thy government, and righteousness [in the place of] thine oppressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Saving Health and thy gates Praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The sun shall no longer be thy light by day; nor shall the moon give light unto thee for brightness; but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light and thy God thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thy sun shall set no more; neither shall thy moon wane: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thy people [shall] all [be] righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever; they shall be shoots of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The small one [shall be] as a thousand; the youngest as a strong nation; I the LORD will hasten it in its time.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
