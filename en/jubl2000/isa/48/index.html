The LORD of the hosts [is] his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That which happened, I have already declared many days ago; and it went forth out of my mouth, and I published it; I did [it] suddenly, and it came to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because I know that thou [art] obstinate, and thy neck [is] an iron sinew, and thy brow bronze;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have already declared it many days ago; before it came to pass I showed [it to] thee: lest thou should say, My idol has done it, my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou hast heard it, thou hast seen it all; and will ye not declare [it]? I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not in days past; nor before this day hast thou heard them lest thou should say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Certainly thou hast never heard this; certainly thou hast never known this; certainly thine ear was never before opened: for I knew that being unfaithful thou would disobey; therefore, I called thee a rebel from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For my name's sake I will defer my anger, and for my praise I will wait patiently for thee that I not cut thee off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined thee, and not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For mine own sake, [even] for mine own sake, I will do [it], for how should [my name] be profaned? and I will not give my glory unto another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I [am] he; I [am] the first, I also [am] the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Certainly my hand founded the earth, and my right hand measured the heavens with the palm; as I named them, they appeared together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All ye, assemble yourselves and hear; who is there among them that declares these [things]? The LORD has loved him, the one who will execute his will on Babylon and his arm [upon] the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, [even] I, have spoken; I have called him: I have brought him, and therefore his way shall be prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was done, I was there: and now the LORD God has sent me and his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus has the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel said: I [am] the LORD thy God who teaches thee to profit, who causes thee to walk by the way [in which] thou dost walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O that thou would look unto my commandments! Then thy peace would be as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy seed would be as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name would never be cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come out of Babylon, flee from among the Chaldeans. Give news of this with a voice of joy; publish this; take this [news] to the end of the earth; say, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they did not thirst [when] he led them through the deserts; he caused water to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[There is] no peace for the wicked, said the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
