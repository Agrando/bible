There is no outward appearance in him, nor beauty. We shall see him, yet nothing attractive about him that we should desire him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He is despised and rejected among men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with weakness; and we hid as it were [our] faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Surely he has borne our sicknesses and suffered our pain: and we considered him stricken, smitten of God, and cast down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But he [was] wounded for our rebellions; [he was] bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace [was] upon him; and by his stripes healing was provided for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All we like sheep have become lost; we have turned each one to his own way; and the LORD transposed in him the iniquity of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he did not open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall count his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the rebellion of my people he was smitten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he made his grave with the wicked, and his death with the rich; even though he had never done evil, neither [was any] deceit in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>With all this the LORD chose to bruise him; subjecting him to grief. When he shall have offered his soul for atonement, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and the will of the LORD shall be prospered in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He shall see of the travail of his soul [and] shall be satisfied. And by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I will divide him [a portion] with the great, and he shall divide the spoil unto the strong because he has poured out his soul unto death, and he was numbered with the rebellious, having born the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
