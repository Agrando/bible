They shall rejoice before thee as they rejoice in the harvest [and] as [men] rejoice when they divide the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thou hast broken his heavy yoke and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For every battle of him who fights [is] with shaking [of the earth] and the rolling of garments in blood; but [this] shall be with burning [and] consuming of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government is [placed] upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called The Wonderful [One], The Counsellor, The God, The Mighty [One], The Eternal Father, The Prince of Peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The multitude of [his] dominion and the peace shall have no end upon the throne of David and upon his Kingdom, ordering it and confirming it in judgment and in righteousness from now on even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of the hosts will perform this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted upon Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people shall know, [even] Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and arrogance of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the wild fig trees are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him and join his enemies together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the people did not turn unto him that smote them, neither did they seek the LORD of the hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The ancient and venerable to look upon is the head; the prophet that teaches lies, he is [the] tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the governors of this people are deceivers, and those who are governed by them [are] lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall he have mercy on their fatherless and widows, for every one [is] a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For wickedness burns as the fire, it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up [like] the lifting up of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Through the wrath of the LORD of the hosts the land is darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall spare his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry, and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied; they shall eat each man the flesh of his own arm:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; [and] they together [shall be] against Judah.
