As the whirlwinds which pass through the wilderness in the land of the south, [so] they come from the terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is shown unto me. For [one] who is treacherous, another who deals treacherously, and for [one] destroyer, [another] destroyer. Rise up, Elam; besiege Media; all the sighing thereof I have made to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore my loins are filled with pain; pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travails; I was bowed down at the hearing of [it]; I was dismayed at the seeing [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart panted; the horror frightened me; the night of my pleasure he has turned into fear unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink; arise, ye princes, [and] anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus has the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman who shall declare what he sees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he saw a chariot [with] a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, [and] a chariot of camels; then he looked with more diligence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he cried, A lion upon the watchman. My lord, I stand continually [all] the day and all night long upon my watchtower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, this chariot of men comes [with] a couple of horsemen. Afterwards he spoke and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken unto the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my harvest, and the people of my threshing floor, that which I have heard of the LORD of the hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of this night? Watchman, what of this night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The morning comes and then the night; if ye will enquire, enquire ye; return, and come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest ye shall pass the night in Arabia, O ye walkers of Dedanim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Go ye out to meet them bringing water for the thirsty, O inhabitants of the land of Tema; succour those who are fleeing with your bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they flee from the presence of the sword, from the presence of the drawn sword, from the presence of the bent bow, from the presence of the grievousness of the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus has the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall be undone:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the residue of the number of valiant archers, sons of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel has spoken [it].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
