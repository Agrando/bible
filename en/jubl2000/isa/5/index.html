My well-beloved had a vineyard in the horn of the sons of oil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and he had fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Therefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, did it bring forth wild grapes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; [and] break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned, nor hoed; but briers and thorns shall come up there; I will even command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the vineyard of the LORD of the hosts [is] the house of Israel and every man of Judah his pleasant plant; and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Woe unto those that join house to house [that] lay field to field until they have done away with the borders! Will ye dwell alone in the midst of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In my ears, the LORD of the hosts [said], Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, [even] great and fair, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning [that] they may continue their drunkenness; that continue until night [until] wine inflames them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the harp and the viol, the tambourine and flutes and wine are in their feasts; but they do not regard the work of the LORD, nor consider the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore my people are gone into captivity because [they have] no knowledge; their glory died of hunger, and their multitude dried up of thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore Sheol has enlarged himself and opened his mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude descended into it and their pomp and he that rejoiced in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the LORD of the hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God, that is holy, shall be sanctified with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the lambs shall be fed after their manner, and strangers shall eat the fat ones that are forsaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Woe unto those that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>that say, Let him make speed [and] hasten his work that we may see [it], and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come that we may know [it]!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Woe unto those that call evil good and good evil; that put darkness for light and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe unto [those that are] wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Woe unto [those that are] mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who justify the wicked for bribes and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore as the fire devours the stubble and the flame consumes the chaff, [so] their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go away as dust because they have cast away the law of the LORD of the hosts and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them and has smitten them; and the mountains trembled, and their carcasses [were] torn in the midst of the streets.
