To open before him the [two-leaved] gates; and the gates shall not be shut:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will go before thee and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of bronze and cut in sunder the bars of iron:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will give thee the hidden treasures and the well guarded secrets that thou may know that I [am] the LORD, the God of Israel, who gives [thee] thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Jacob my servant's sake and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the LORD, and [there is] no one else; [there is] no God beside me; I shall gird thee, though thou hast not known me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that it may be known from the rising of the sun and from where it goes down that [there is] no one beside me. I [am] the LORD, and [there is] no one else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I form the light and create darkness; I make peace and create evil: I [am] the LORD that does all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Release, ye heavens, from above, and the clouds shall pour down righteousness; let the earth open [up], and let salvation and righteousness bear their fruit; let them produce [fruit] together; I the LORD have created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe unto him that strives with his Maker! [Let] the potsherd [strive] with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashions it, What doth thou make; thy work [has] no form?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe unto him that says unto [his] father, Why dost thou beget? or to the woman, Why hast thou brought forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come; inquire of me concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have made the earth, and created man upon it, I, [even] my hands, have stretched out the heavens and I have commanded all their host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have awakened him in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build my city, and he shall loose my captives, not for price nor for bribes, saith the LORD of the hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee; they shall make supplication unto thee, [saying], Surely God [is] in thee; and [there is] no one else; [there is] none [other] beside God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Verily thou [art] God, that thou [might] hide thyself; God of Israel, who saves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They shall be ashamed and also confounded, all of them; all the makers of idols shall go forth ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Israel is saved in the LORD, eternal salvation; ye shall never be ashamed nor confounded through all ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus has the LORD said that creates the heavens; God himself that forms the earth, he who made it and established it. He did not create it in vain; he created it to be inhabited; I [am] the LORD; and [there] is no one else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I have not spoken in secret in [a] dark place of the earth. Not without substance did I say unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me; I [am] the LORD who speaks righteousness, who declares things that are right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, all ye [that are] escaped of the Gentiles. They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto the god [that] does not save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell ye, and bring [them] near; [yea], let them take counsel together; who caused this to be heard from the beginning and has declared it from that time, except me, the LORD? and [there is] no God beside me; a just God and a Saviour; [there is] no one besides me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I [am] God, and [there is] no one else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I have sworn by myself; the word is gone out of my mouth [in] righteousness and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow; every tongue shall swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And unto me he shall say, Surely in the LORD [is] the righteousness and the strength; until he shall come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the LORD shall all the generation of Israel be justified and shall glory.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
