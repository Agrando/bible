And when he heard [it], he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let not thy God, in whom thou dost trust, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly, and shalt thou be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have the gods of the Gentiles delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, [as] Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden which [were] in Telassar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where [is] the king of Hamath and the king of Arphad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim Hena, and Ivah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah took the letters from the hand of the messengers and read them; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD and spread them before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O LORD of the hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest [between] the cherubim, thou [art] the God, [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made the heavens and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent [his messengers] to blaspheme the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and have cast their gods into the fire, for they [were] no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou [art] the LORD, [even] thou only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This [is] the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him, Has he despised thee? Has he laughed thee to scorn O virgin daughter of Zion? Has he shaken his head behind thy back O daughter of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots I shall come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of Lebanon, and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof [and] the choice fir trees thereof; and I will enter into the height of his border [and] the forest of his Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have dug and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet shall I dry up all the rivers of sustenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Hast thou not heard long ago [how] I have done it [and] of ancient times that I have formed it? Now I have brought it to pass, that thou should be to lay waste defenced cities [into] ruinous heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And their inhabitants, of little strength, dismayed and confounded shall be [as] the grass of the field and [as] the green shrub [as] the grass on the housetops, that before it comes to maturity it is dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have understood thy state, thy going out and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou didst come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this [shall be] a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat [this] year such as grows of itself; and the second year that which springs of the same: and in the third year ye shall sow and shall reap and shall plant vineyards and shall eat the fruit thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and from Mount Zion shall come an escape; the zeal of the LORD of the hosts shall do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the angel of the LORD went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they [were] all dead corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
