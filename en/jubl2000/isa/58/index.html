[why] have we afflicted our soul, and thou dost take no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find [your own] pleasure and exact your own estates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as [ye do this] day to make your voice to be heard on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? [is it] to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes [under him]? wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[Is] not rather the fast that I have chosen, to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the ties of oppression, to release [into freedom] those who are broken, and that ye break every yoke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[Is it] not to share thy bread with the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou not hide thyself from thy brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shalt thou call, and thou shalt hear the LORD; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I [am]. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and [if] thou pour out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness [be] as the noonday:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And [they] shall build up out of thee the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the [fallen] foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, [from] doing thy will on my holy day; and call the sabbath [the] delightful, holy, glorious [day] of the LORD; and shalt honour him by not doing thine own ways, nor seeking thine own will, nor speaking [thine own] words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and cause thee to eat of the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken [it].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
