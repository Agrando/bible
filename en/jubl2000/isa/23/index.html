Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in; from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; [thou] mart of Zidon, that [by] passing over the sea thou wert replenished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Her provision [was] from the plantings [that grow] with the many waters of the Nile, of the harvest of the river. She was also the mart of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Be thou ashamed, O Zidon, for the sea has spoken, [even] the strength of the sea, saying, I have never travailed nor brought forth children, neither did I nourish up young men [nor] bring up virgins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the report comes unto Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the news from Tyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[Is] this your joyous [city], whose antiquity [is] of ancient days?
