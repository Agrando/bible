And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son who shall reign, as the LORD has said of the sons of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>This [is] the thing that ye must do: A third part of you, those who enter on the sabbath, [shall be] porters at the doors with the priests and the Levites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and a third part [shall be] at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation; and all the people [shall be] in the courts of the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But let no one come into the house of the LORD, except the priests and the Levites that minister; they shall go in, for they [are] holy; but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Levites shall compass the king round about, each one shall have his weapons in his hand; and whoever else comes into the house shall be put to death; and ye shall be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the Levites and all Judah did according to all the things that Jehoiada, the priest, had commanded, and each one took his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath with those that were to go [out] on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the courses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moreover, Jehoiada, the priest, delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields, that [had been] king David's, which [were] in the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he set all the people in order, each one having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they brought out the king's son and put the crown upon him and [gave him] the testimony and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, [Long] live the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running of those that were praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And she looked and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entrance and the princes and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets, and those that knew how to praise sang with instruments of music. Then Athaliah rent her clothes and said, Treason, Treason.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jehoiada, the priest, brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them, Remove her from the order of the house, and whoever follows her, let them be slain with the sword. For the priest had commanded, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they laid hands on her, and she entered into the entrance of the horse gate of the king's house, and they slew her there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the LORD'S people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then all the people went to the house of Baal and broke it down and broke in pieces his altars and his images and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Also Jehoiada ordered the offices of the house of the LORD under the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as [it is] written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, [as it was ordained] by David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He also set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD so that there should be no way for anyone [who was] unclean to enter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and those that governed the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the LORD; and they came through the high gate into the king's house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at rest after they had slain Athaliah with the sword.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
