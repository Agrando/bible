So Ahazia the son of Jehoram, king of Judah reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore, he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab, for they were his counsellors, after the death of his father, to his destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He walked after their counsel and went with Jehoram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, to war against Hazael, king of Syria at Ramothgilead, where the Syrians smote Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah went down to see Jehoram, the son of Ahab, at Jezreel, because he was there sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But this was of God so that Ahaziah would be tread under foot by coming to Joram; for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram [to encounter] Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab and found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (for he had hid himself in Samaria) and brought him to Jehu; and when they had slain him, they buried him, Because, they said, He [is] the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no strength to be able to retain the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were being slain, and kept him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada, the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he was with them hid in the house of God six years; and Athaliah reigned over the land.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
