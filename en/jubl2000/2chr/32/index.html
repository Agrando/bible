And the people were upheld by the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he [himself laid siege] against Lachish, and all his power with him) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that [were] at Jerusalem, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus hath said Sennacherib, king of Assyria, In whom do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does not Hezekiah deceive you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Have ye not known what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of [other] lands? Could peradventure the gods of the Gentiles of those lands deliver their lands out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who [was there] among all the gods of those Gentiles that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of my hands? Why should your God be able to deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now, therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you in this matter neither believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hands and out of the hands of my fathers; how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And his servants spoke yet [more] against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In addition to this, he wrote letters that blasphemed the LORD God of Israel and spoke against him, saying, As the gods of the Gentiles of [other] lands could not deliver their people out of my hand, neither shall the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that [were] on the wall, to make them afraid and to trouble them, that they might take the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, [which were] the work of the hands of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And for this [cause] Hezekiah, the king, and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD sent an angel who cut off all the mighty men of valour and the captains and the princes in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And as he entered into the house of his god, those that had come forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus, the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hands of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from the hands of all [others] and guided them concerning everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And many brought a present unto the LORD to Jerusalem and precious gifts unto Hezekiah, king of Judah, so that he was magnified in the sight of all the Gentiles from then on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In those days Hezekiah was sick unto the death and prayed to the LORD, who responded to him and gave him a sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Hezekiah did not render again according to the benefit [done] unto him, for his heart lifted itself up; therefore there was wrath against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, [both] he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hezekiah had exceedingly great riches and honour, and he made himself treasures of silver and of gold and of precious stones and of spices and of shields and of all manner of pleasant vessels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>storehouses also for the increase of grain and wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and places for cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moreover, he made himself cities and possessions of sheep and cows in abundance, for God had given him great substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah was prospered in all that he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>However, because of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all [that was] in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his mercy, behold, they [are] written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, [and] in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh, his son, reigned in his stead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
