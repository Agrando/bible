So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thy father made our yoke grievous; now, therefore, ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon, his father, while he yet lived, saying, What do you counsel to reply to this people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they spoke unto him, saying, If thou wilt seek the good of this people and please them and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto them, What do you counsel us to reply to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the young men that were brought up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spoke unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little [finger] is thicker than my father's loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had commanded, saying, Come again to me on the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king answered them roughly, [for] King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king did not hearken unto the people, for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah, the Shilonite, unto Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when all Israel [saw] that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David or inheritance in the son of Jesse? Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now, David, see to thine own house! So all Israel went to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Rehoboam reigned over the sons of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who [was] over the tribute and the sons of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. So King Rehoboam made speed to get into a chariot and fled to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
