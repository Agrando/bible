And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again, saying, Thy servants have fulfilled all that was committed unto them to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have delivered it into the hand of those who were commissioned and to the hand of the workmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Shaphan, the scribe, told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest, has given me a book. And Shaphan read in it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the king heard the words of the law, he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the king commanded Hilkiah and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and Shaphan, the scribe, and Asaiah, a servant of the king's, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go, enquire of the LORD for me and for the remnant of Israel and of Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found, for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all the things that are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Hilkiah and those of the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the house of doctrine); and they spoke to her to that [effect].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she answered them, The LORD God of Israel hath said thus, Tell the man that sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>that thus hath the LORD said, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>because they have forsaken me and have sacrificed unto other gods, provoking me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore, my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus hath the LORD God of Israel said, [Because] thou hast heard the words [of the book],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and thy heart became tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, hearing his words against this place and against its inhabitants [and] didst humble thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me, I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and with him all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites and all the people, great and small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and that they would keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and with all their soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it]. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the lands that [pertained] to the sons of Israel and made all that were present in Israel serve the LORD their God [only]. [And] all his days they did not depart from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
