Then Manasseh knew that the LORD [was] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now after, this he built the wall outside the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entrance of the fish gate, and fenced Ophel and raised it up to a very great height and put captains of the army in all the fenced cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Likewise, he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the LORD and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem and cast [them] out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he repaired the altar of the LORD and sacrificed upon it sacrifices of peace and of praise and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed in the high places, [yet] unto the LORD their God only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they [are written] in the acts of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>His prayer also and how he was heard, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places upon which he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he humbled himself; behold, these things are written among the words of the seers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon, his son, reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Amon [was] twenty-two years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done, for Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh, his father, had made, and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he never humbled himself before the LORD as Manasseh, his father, humbled himself; to the contrary Amon multiplied the guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the people of the land slew all those that had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah, his son, king in his stead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
