Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred [sheep] and three hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Conaniah, likewise, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, princes of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the sacrifices of the passover five thousand [sheep], and five hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites, likewise, in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood taken] from the hands of the Levites [who] flayed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they took away [part of the animals that they had] for the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, for them to offer unto the LORD, as [it is] written in the book of Moses. And [they did], likewise, with the oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance, but that which had been sanctified, they cooked in pots and in caldrons and in pans and divided [them] speedily among all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were occupied in the sacrifice of the burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore, the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Likewise, the singers, the sons of Asaph, [were] in their place, according to the commandment of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the king's seer; and the porters [waited] at every gate; it was not necessary for them to depart from their ministry, for their brethren, the Levites, prepared for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover and to sacrifice the burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of King Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the solemn feast of unleavened bread for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there was no passover like unto that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel, the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel that were present, together with all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the year eighteen of the reign of Josiah, this passover was kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the house, Necho, king of Egypt, came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? [I do] not [come] against thee this day, but against the house that makes war with me, for God commanded me to make haste. Forbear from [meddling with] God, who [is] with me, that he not destroy thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless, Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and did not hearken unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight him in the valley of Megiddo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am sore wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His servants, therefore, took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in Israel, which [are] written in the lamentations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his mercy, according to [that which was] written in the law of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and his deeds, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
