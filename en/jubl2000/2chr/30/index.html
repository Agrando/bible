But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon each one</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[that] has prepared his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, even though [he is] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus, the sons of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the solemnity of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD, day by day, with instruments of strength unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah spoke unto the heart of all the Levites that had good understanding to [serve] the LORD, and they ate [the sacrifices] of the feast for seven days, offering sacrifices of peace and giving thanks unto the LORD God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept [another] seven days with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah, king of Judah, had given to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep, and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep, and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel [there was] not the like in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came [up] to the dwelling place of his sanctuary, unto heaven.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
