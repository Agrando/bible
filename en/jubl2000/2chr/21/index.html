And Jehoram, his son, reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he had brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these [were] the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And their father had given them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he [was] the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now Jehoram rose up against the kingdom of his father, and he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and likewise [some] of the princes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehoram [was] thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he wrought [that which was] evil in the eyes of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However, the LORD would not destroy the house of David because of the covenant that he had made with David and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In his days Edom rebelled from under the dominion of Judah and made themselves a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him, and he rose up by night and smote Edom who had compassed him in and all the captains of the chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>With all this Edom [remained in] rebellion, out from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
