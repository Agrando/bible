Is there not power and might in thy hand so that no one is able to withstand thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[Art] not thou our God, [who] didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel and didst give it to the seed of Abraham, thy friend, for ever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they have dwelt in it and have built thee a sanctuary in it for thy name, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If evil comes upon us or the sword of judgment or pestilence or famine, we shall stand before this house and in thy presence (for thy name [is] in this house) and cry unto thee out of our tribulations, and thou wilt hear us and save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now, behold, the sons of Ammon and of Moab and [those of] Mount Seir, whose [land] thou would not let Israel enter when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them and did not destroy them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>behold they reward us by coming to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>O our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us; we do not know what to do; but our eyes are [fixed] upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then upon Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he said, Hearken, all Judah, and [ye] inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou King Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Do not be afraid nor dismayed before this great multitude, for the battle [is] not yours, but God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow ye shall go down against them; behold, they shall come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them next to the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye shall not [need] to fight in this [battle[; set yourselves, stand [still], and see the salvation of the LORD with you. O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, neither be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the LORD [shall be] with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jehoshaphat bowed his head with [his] face to the ground, and likewise all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohath and of the sons of the Korah, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they arose early in the morning and while they were going forth into the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe the LORD your God, and ye shall be secure; believe his prophets, and ye shall be prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed some to sing unto the LORD and to praise in the beauty of holiness, while the army went out and to say, Praise the LORD, for his mercy [endures] for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set the sons of Moab and those of Mount Seir to ambush the sons of Ammon, who were coming against Judah; and they smote [one another].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy [them]; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, each one helped his companion to kill himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Judah came to the watch tower of the wilderness, they looked for the multitude, and, behold, they [were] fallen to the earth dead, for none had escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to spoil them, they found among them an abundance of riches and of dead bodies and clothing and precious vessels which they took for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering in the spoil, it was so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD; therefore, they called the name of that place, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they returned, those of Judah and those of Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat at their head, to go again to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the land when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat had rest, for his God gave him rest round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah; [he was] thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he walked in the way of Asa, his father, and did not depart from it, doing [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>With all this the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of Jehu, the son of Hanani, who [is] mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>After these things, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, joined himself with Ahaziah, king of Israel, who was given over to wickedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Eziongeber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Eliezer, the son of Dodavah of Mareshah, prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD shall destroy thy works. And the ships were broken, and they were not able to go to Tarshish.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
