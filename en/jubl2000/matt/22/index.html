And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast [him] into the darkness outside; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but few [are] chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees left and took counsel how they might entangle him in [his] word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent out unto him their disciples with those of Herod, saying, Master, we know that thou art a lover of truth and teachest the way of God with truth and that thou takest care for no [man], for thou art no respecter of persons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said, Why tempt ye me, [ye] hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the coin of the tribute. And they presented unto him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They say unto him, Caesar's. Then said he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they had heard [these words], they marvelled and left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Master, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were with us seven brothers, and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no seed, left his wife unto his brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which is spoken unto you by God, who saith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I AM the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of [the] dead, but of [the] living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the multitude heard [this], they were astonished at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the Pharisees, hearing that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one of them, [who was] an interpreter of the law, asked [him a question], tempting him and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and great commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, What think ye of the Christ? Whose son is he? They say unto him, [The Son] of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said unto them, How then does David in Spirit call him Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no one was able to answer him a word, neither dared anyone from that day forth ask him any more [questions].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
