And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Go into the city to a certain man and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them, and they made ready the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now when the evening was come, he sat down [at the table] with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as they ate, he said, Verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he answered and said, He that dips [his] hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas, who was betraying him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took the bread and, having blessed [it], broke [it] and gave [it] to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And taking the cup and having given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I say unto you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night; for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all [men] shall be offended in thee, [yet] I will never be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night before the cock crows, thou shalt deny me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus came with them unto a place called Gethsemane and said unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he said unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went a little further and fell on his face, praying and saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he came unto the disciples and found them asleep and said unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he came unto his disciples and said unto them, Sleep on now and take [your] rest; behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise, let us be going; behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he yet spoke, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the princes of the priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; hold him fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And forthwith he came to Jesus and said, Receive joy, master; and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, why art thou come? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, behold, one of those who was with Jesus stretched out [his] hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place, for all those that take the sword shall perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that same hour Jesus said to the multitude, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And those that had laid hold on Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed him afar off unto the patio of the high priest and went in and sat with the servants to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the princes of the priests and the elders and all the council sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>but found none; though many false witnesses came, [yet] found they none. At the last came two false witnesses</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>who said, This [fellow] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest arose and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing [to] what these witness against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said [it]; nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spit in his face and buffeted him, and others smote [him] with the staves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ; who is he that smote thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter sat outside in the patio; and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied before [them] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him and said unto those that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a while those that stood by came unto [him] and said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them, for thy speech makes thee manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man. And immediately a cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said unto him, Before the cock crows, thou shalt deny me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
