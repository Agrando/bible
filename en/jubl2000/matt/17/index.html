Likewise the Son of man shall also suffer of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a [certain] man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic and suffers miserably; for many times he has fallen into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus answered and said, O unfaithful and crooked generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus apart and said, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unfaithfulness; for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove from here to yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Howbeit this lineage [of demons] does not go out but by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they were come to Capernaum, those that received the two drachmas came to Peter and said, Does not your master pay the two drachmas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus spoke unto him first, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own sons or of strangers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter said unto him, Of strangers. Jesus said unto him, Then the sons are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the first fish that comes up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a stater [a coin worth four drachmas]; take that, and give it unto them for me and thee.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
