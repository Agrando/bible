for ye shut up the kingdom of the heavens in front of men, for ye neither go in [yourselves], neither suffer ye those that are entering to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses and for a pretence make long prayer; therefore, ye shall receive the greater judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Woe unto you, [ye] blind guides, who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Ye] fools and blind, for which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever swears by the gift that is upon it, he is a debtor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[Ye] fools and blind, for which one [is] greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whosoever therefore shall swear by the altar, swears by it and by all things thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whosoever shall swear by the temple, swears by it and by Him that dwells therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that shall swear by the heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him that sits thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted that which is more important of the law: judgment, mercy, and faith; these were expedient for ye to have done, and not to leave the other [undone].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[Ye] blind guides, who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup or of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and incontinence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[Thou] blind Pharisee, cleanse first that [which is] within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whitewashed sepulchres, who indeed appear beautiful outside, but inside are full of dead [men's] bones and of all uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the sepulchres of the righteous</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore ye are witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>[Ye] serpents, [ye] generation of vipers, how can ye escape the judgment of hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes, and [some] of them ye shall kill and crucify, and [some] of them ye shall scourge in your synagogues and persecute [them] from city to city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye murdered between the temple and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [thou] that didst kill the prophets and stone those who are sent unto thee, how often I desired to gather thy children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under [her] wings, and ye would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me from now on until ye shall say, Blessed [is] he that comes in the name of the Lord.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
