This is he who was planted beside the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he that was planted in stony places, the same is he that hears the word and receives it immediately with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet he has no root in himself but is temporal, for when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, by and by he is offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that was planted among the thorns is he that hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that was planted in good ground is he that hears the word and understands [it] and who also bears the fruit and brings forth: one a hundredfold and another sixty and another thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He put forth another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is likened unto a man who sows good seed in his field</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then the tares appeared also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the servants of the husband of the house came and said unto him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? From where then does it have tares?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said unto them, [The] enemy, a man, has done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, No, lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He put forth another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>which indeed is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and make their nests in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He spoke another parable unto them: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus spoke all these things unto the multitude in parables and said nothing unto them without parables</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house, and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said unto them, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the end of this age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and those who do iniquity</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. [He] who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto treasure hid in the field, which when found, a man hides it and, for the joy thereof, goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind [of fish],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was full, they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So shall it be at the end of the age; the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the just</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They answered unto him, Yes, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe [who is] instructed in the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man, a husband of a house, who brings forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished and said, From where does this [man] have this wisdom and [these] mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And his sisters, are they not all with us? From where then does this [man] have all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour except in his own country and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not [do] many mighty works there because of their unbelief.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
