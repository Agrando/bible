A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those that wear soft [clothing] are in kings' houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is [he] of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist; notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From the days of John the Baptist until now, life is given unto the kingdom of the heavens, and the valiant take hold of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if ye will receive [it], this is that Elijah who was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But unto whom shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets and shouting unto their fellows</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to Hades, for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in those of Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, I praise thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and understanding and hast revealed them unto children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even so, Father, for thus it was pleasing in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no one has known the Son but the Father, neither has anyone known the Father except the Son and [he] unto whom the Son will reveal [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and ye shall find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
