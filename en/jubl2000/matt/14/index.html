he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Herod had laid hold on John and bound him and put [him] in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a platter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king was sorry; nevertheless because of the oath and of those who sat with him at the table, he commanded [it] to be given [her].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his head was brought in a platter and given to the damsel, and she brought [it] to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus heard [of it], he departed from there by ship into a desert place apart; and when the people had heard [of it], they followed him on foot out of the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they said unto him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, Bring them here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to [his] disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all ate and were filled, and they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And those that had eaten were about five thousand men besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he had sent the multitude away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray; and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves, for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went unto them, walking upon the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But straightway Jesus spoke unto them, saying, Trust [that] I AM; be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me [to] come unto thee upon the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked upon the water to go to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But seeing that the wind was strong, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately Jesus stretched forth [his] hand and caught him and said unto him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then those that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Truly thou art [the] Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were sick</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment, and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
