What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a bill of divorce and to put her away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said unto them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except [it be] for fornication and shall marry another, commits adultery, and whosoever marries her that is put away commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with [his] wife, it is not expedient to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said unto them, Everyone cannot receive this word, except [those] unto whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are some eunuchs who were so born from [their] mother's womb; and there are some eunuchs who were made eunuchs of men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then were there brought unto him little children that he should put [his] hands on them and pray, and the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he laid [his] hands on them and departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said unto him, Why dost thou call me good? [There is] none good but one, [that is], God, but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honour thy father and [thy] mother, and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said unto him, All these things I have kept from my youth up; what do I lack?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said unto him, If thou desire to be perfect, go [and] sell what thou hast and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come [and] follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard that word, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is difficult that a rich man shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say unto you, It is easier to put a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But his disciples hearing these things were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus beheld [them] and said unto them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter answered and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every one that has forsaken houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many [that are] first shall be last, and [many of the] last [shall be] first.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
