go ye out to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the foolish said unto the prudent, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the prudent answered, saying, Lest there be not enough for us and you, but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and those that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For [it is] like a man travelling into a far country, [who] called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each one according to his faculty, and straightway took his journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And after he was gone, he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made another five talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And likewise he that [had received] two, he also gained another two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he that had received one went and dug in the earth and hid his lord's money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And after a long time the lord of those servants came and reckoned accounts with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so he that had received five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Lord, thou didst deliver unto me five talents; behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou didst deliver unto me two talents; behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>therefore, I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth; behold, thou hast what is thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>His lord answered and said unto him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I have not scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>therefore, it was expedient for thee to have put my money to the bankers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take, therefore, the talent from him and give [it] unto him who has ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For unto every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance, but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him, then he shall sit upon the throne of his glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divides [his] sheep from the goats,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the King say unto those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for I was hungry, and ye gave me food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry and feed [thee]? or thirsty and give [thee] drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see thee a stranger and take [thee] in? or naked and clothe [thee]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and come unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brothers, ye have done [it] unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he shall also say unto those who [shall be] on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for I was hungry, and ye gave me no food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then they shall also answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he shall answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of my brothers, ye did [it] not to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
