And he arose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as he sat at food in [his] house, behold, many publicans and sinners that had come sat down at the table with Jesus and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the Pharisees saw [it], they said unto his disciples, Why does your Master eat with publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Jesus heard [that], he said unto them, Those that are whole need not a physician, but those that are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore go ye and learn what this is, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, for I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples do not fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No one mends an old garment with a piece of new cloth, for that patch takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the wineskins break, and the wine runs out, and the wineskins perish; but they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he spoke these things unto them, behold, a certain ruler came and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus arose and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, behold, a woman who was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind [him] and touched the hem of his garment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus turned around, and when he saw her, he said, Trust, daughter; thy faith has made thee free. And the woman was free from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>he said unto them, Give place, for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the people were put forth, he went in and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the fame of this went abroad into all that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yes, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See [that] no one knows [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the multitude marvelled, saying, Such a thing has never been seen in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees said, He casts out demons through the prince of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every weakness among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he saw the multitude, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he said unto his disciples, The harvest truly [is] plenteous, but the labourers [are] few;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
