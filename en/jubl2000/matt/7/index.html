Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither [can] a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So that by their fruits ye shall know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then I will profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, whosoever hears these words of mine and does them, I will liken him unto a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it did not fall, for it was founded upon a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every one that hears these words of mine and does not do them shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell; and great was the fall of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these words, the multitude marvelled at his doctrine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he taught them as [one] having authority and not as the scribes.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
