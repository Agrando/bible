see that ye be not troubled, for it is necessary that all these things must take place; but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in [different] places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All these [are] the beginning of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because lawlessness shall abound, the charity of many shall wax cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, when ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, which shall stand in the holy place (whosoever reads, let him understand),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then let those who are in Judaea flee into the mountains;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>let him who is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And woe unto those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if any man shall say unto you, Behold, here [is] the Christ, or there, believe [it] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in such a manner that they shall deceive, if possible, the very elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, I have told you before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore if they say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth; Behold, [he is] in the secret chambers, believe [it] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as the lightning that comes out of the east and shines even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For wherever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he shall send his angels with a trumpet and a great voice, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When his branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves, ye know that summer [is] nigh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, [even] at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass until all these things are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But of that day and hour no one knows, no, not even the angels of the heavens, but my Father only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But as the days of Noah [were], so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two [women shall be] grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But know this that if the husband of the house knew in what watch the thief would come, he would watch and would not suffer his house to be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Therefore be ye also ready; the Son of man is to come in the hour that ye think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Who then is the faithful and prudent servant, whom his lord has made ruler over his household to give them food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed [is] that servant whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and shall begin to smite [his] fellowservants and even to eat and drink with the drunken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he does not look for [him] and in an hour that he is not aware of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and shall cut him off and appoint [him] his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
