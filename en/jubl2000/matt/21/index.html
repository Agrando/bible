And Jesus said unto them, Yes; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of children and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he left them and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it and found nothing upon it, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee from now on for ever. And then the fig tree withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the disciples saw [it], they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only do this to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all things, whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he was come into the temple, the princes of the priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you a word, which if ye tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of John, where was it from? from heaven or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we shall say, Of men, we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answered Jesus and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But what do you think? A [certain] man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He answered and said, I will not, but afterward he repented and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, I [will go], Lord, and went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did the will of [his] father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go ahead of you into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not, but the publicans and the harlots believed him, and ye, when ye had seen [it], repented not afterward that ye might believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another parable: There was a certain husband of a house who planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, he sent other servants more than the first, and they did unto them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us take his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they took hold of him and cast [him] out of the vineyard and slew [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say unto him, He will destroy those wicked men without mercy and will let out [his] vineyard unto other husbandmen who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a people bringing forth the fruits thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And as the princes of the priests and Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude because they held him as a prophet.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
