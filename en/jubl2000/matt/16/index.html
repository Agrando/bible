O [ye] hypocrites, ye know how to make decisions based on the face of the heaven, and regarding the signs of the times are ye unable?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah.
