If they have called the husband of the house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] those of his household?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Fear them not therefore, for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, nor hid that shall not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light, and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye from the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And fear not those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul, but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?
