But Mordecai did not kneel or worship [before him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the king's servants, who [were] in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why dost thou pass over the king's commandment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he did not hearken unto them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's word would stand; for he had told them that he [was] a Jew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not kneel or worship [before] him, then Haman was filled with wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he thought it a small matter to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for now they had declared unto him the people of Mordecai; therefore, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that [were] throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the first month, that [is], the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that [is], the lot, before Haman from day to day and from month to month, and the twelfth [month], that [is], the month Adar was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Haman said unto King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws [are] different from all [other] people; neither do they observe the king's laws: therefore, it [is] not profitable for the king to allow them to remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If it pleases the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the public works, to bring [it] into the king's treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king said unto Haman, The silver [is] given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the king's scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants and to the governors that [were] over each province and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof and [to] every people after their language; in the name of King Ahasuerus it was written and sealed with the king's ring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The copy of the writing was to be given as law in every province that it be published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The posts went out in haste by the king's commandment, and the law was given in Shushan, the palace.
