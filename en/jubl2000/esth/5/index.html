So Esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the king said unto her, What wilt thou, Queen Esther? And what [is] thy request? It shall be given thee, even to the half of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esther answered, If [it seems] good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What [is] thy petition? And it shall be granted thee. What [is] thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then answered Esther and said, My petition and my request [is]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I have found grace in the sight of the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Haman went forth that day joyful and with a glad heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate [and] that he did not stand up nor move for him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself, and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh, his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his sons and all [the things] in which the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Haman said, moreover, Even Esther, the queen, let no one come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself, and tomorrow I am also invited by her with the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see Mordecai, the Jew, sitting at the king's gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged upon it; then go in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the gallows to be made.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
