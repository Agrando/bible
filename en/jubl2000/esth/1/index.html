the beds [were of] gold and silver, upon a pavement of porphyre and of marble and of alabaster and of blue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they gave [them] drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another) and royal wine in abundance, according to the power of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the drink [was] according to this law: let no one constrain themselves; for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to the will of each one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Likewise Vashti, the queen, made a banquet for the women [in] the royal house of King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs that served in the presence of Ahasuerus, the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>to bring Vashti, the queen, before the king with the crown of the kingdom, to show the people and the princes her beauty, for she [was] fair to behold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's word by [his] eunuchs; therefore, the king was very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king asked the wise men, who knew the times, (for so [was] the king's manner toward all that knew [about] the law and rights,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the next to him [was] Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, [and] who sat first in the kingdom;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What shall we do unto Queen Vashti according to law because she has not performed the decree of King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti, the queen, has not only committed iniquity against the king, but also against all the princes and against all the people that [are] in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For [this] deed of the queen shall be [known] abroad unto all the women so that they shall despise their husbands, saying, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti, the queen, to be brought in before him, but she did not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen shall say [this] unto all the king's princes, and [there shall be] much contempt and wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If it pleases the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it not be altered, That Vashti come no more before King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And this sentence which the king shall make shall be heard throughout all his empire, although it is great, and all the wives shall give their husbands honour, from the greatest to the least.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, saying, That every man should bear rule in his own house and that [it] should be published according to the language of every people.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
