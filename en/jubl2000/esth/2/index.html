And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[Now] in Shushan, the palace, there was a certain Jew, whose name [was] Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he had brought up Hadassah, that [is], Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid [was] fair and beautiful; and as her father and mother were dead, Mordecai had taken her for his own daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan, the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the maiden pleased him, and she found mercy before him; and he speedily gave her that which was necessary for purification and her rations, and seven maidens, [which were] meet to be given her out of the king's house; and he moved her and her maids into the best [place] of the house of the women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Esther had not declared her people nor her birth, for Mordecai had charged her that she should not declare [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know the peace of Esther and what was done with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when each maid's turn was come to go in to King Ahasuerus, after she had been twelve months according to the law [regarding] the women (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [that is], six months with oil of myrrh and six months with aromatic odours and oils for women),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>then thus came [each] maiden unto the king; whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines; she came in unto the king no more, unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai, the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained grace in the sight of all those that looked upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Esther was taken unto King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which [is] the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and mercy in his sight more than did all the other virgins so that he set the crown of the kingdom upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king made a great banquet unto all his princes and his servants, the banquet of Esther; and he made a release to the provinces [of their taxes] and gave gifts according to the power of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Esther had not [yet] declared her birth nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai as when she was being brought up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth and sought to lay hand on King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the thing was known by Mordecai, who told [it] unto Esther, the queen; and Esther notified the king [of this] in Mordecai's name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the Chronicles before the king.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
