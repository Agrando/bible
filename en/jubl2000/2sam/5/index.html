Therefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David dwelt in the fortress and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David went on and grew great, and the LORD God of the hosts [was] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram, king of Tyre, also sent messengers to David, and cedar trees and carpenters and masons, and they built David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David understood that the LORD had confirmed him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem after he had come from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these [were] the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphalet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David, and David heard [of it] and went down to the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up, for I without a doubt will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there and said, The LORD has broken forth upon my enemies before me as the breach of waters. Therefore, he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they left their images there, and David and his men burned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up, [but] go around behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and when thou hearest thunder going through the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt move, for then the LORD shall go out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did so as the LORD had commanded him and smote the Philistines from Geba unto Gazer.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
