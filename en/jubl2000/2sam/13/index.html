Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed and pretend to be sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come and give me food and make the food in my sight that I may see [it] and eat [it] at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick, and when the king cane to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar, my sister, come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house and make him something to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was lying down. And she took flour and kneaded [it] and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then she took a pan and poured [them] out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Send everyone out from me. And they all went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought [them] into the chamber to Amnon, her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she had brought [them] unto him to eat, he took hold of her and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not commit this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, where shall I go with my reproach? And as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now, therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Howbeit, he would not hearken unto her voice, but, being stronger than she, forced her and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred with which he hated her [was] greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said unto him, [There is] no cause; this evil in sending me away [is] greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said, Put now this [woman] out from me and bolt the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And [she had] a garment of different colours upon her, for with such robes were the king's daughters [that were] virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of different colours that [was] on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom, her brother, said unto her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? But now remain silent, my sister; he is thy brother; do not regard this thing in thy heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Absalom spoke neither good nor bad unto his brother Amnon, for Absalom hated Amnon because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which [is] beside Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Absalom came to the king and said, Behold now, thy servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him; however, he would not go but blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But because Absalom pressed him, he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and they all got upon their mules and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the rumour came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Do not let my lord suppose [that] they have slain all the young men, the king's sons, for only Amnon is dead, for by the mouth of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now, therefore, do not let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead, for only Amnon is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there came many people by the way of the side of the mountain behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come; as thy servant said, so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Absalom fled and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So [after] Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he was there three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And King David longed to see Absalom, for he was now comforted concerning Amnon, who was dead.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
