And I will cause thee to rest from all thy enemies. Likewise, the LORD makes thee to know that he will make thee a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when thy days are fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took [it] from Saul, whom I took away from before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said, O Lord GOD, Who am I and what [is] my house that thou hast brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come and that this shall be the condition of a man, O Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what more can David say unto thee? For thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For thou hast done all these great things by thy word and according to thine own heart to make thy servant know [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, thou art great, O LORD God, for [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And who in the earth is like thy people, like Israel? A Gentile for [the love of] whom God went to ransom as a people to himself and to give him a name and to do with you great and terrible things in thy land because of thy people whom thou didst redeem unto thee from Egypt, [from] the Gentiles and their gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel [to be] thy people for ever, and thou, LORD, have become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house, raise [it] up for ever and do as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For [thus] shall thy name be magnified for ever that it [may] be said, The LORD of the hosts [is] God over Israel and that the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou, O LORD of the hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house. Therefore, thy servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer in thy presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Lord GOD, thou [art] God, and thy words shall be firm, and thou hast spoken this goodness unto thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore, now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee, for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken [it], and with thy blessing the house of thy servant shall be blessed for ever.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
