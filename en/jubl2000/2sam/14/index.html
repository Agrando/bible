So Joab put the words in her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said, Save [me], O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king said unto her, What ails thee? And she answered, I am a widow woman, and my husband is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thy handmaid had two sons, and the two strove together in the field, and [there was] no one to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and we will destroy the heir also. So they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband [neither] name nor remainder upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give a command concerning thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity [be] on me and on my father's house; and the king and his throne [be] guiltless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said, Whoever speaks against thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then she said, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou will not allow the avengers of blood to increase the damage by destroying my son. And he said, As the LORD lives, not one hair of thy son shall fall to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak [one] word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? For the king speaks this word as one who is guilty in that the king does not bring home again his banished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is certain that we die and [are] as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect [any] person; yet he does devise means that his outcasts not be expelled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now, therefore, that I have come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. But thy handmaid said [to herself], I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the word of his handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man [that would] destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then thy handmaid said, Let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil; and let the LORD thy God be with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the king said, [Is not] the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, By the life of thy soul, my lord the king, I can not turn to the right hand or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken; for thy servant Joab, he commanded me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>to bring about this form of speech thy servant Joab has done this thing; but my lord [is] wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know that which is [done] in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing; go, therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joab fell to the ground on his face and worshipped and blessed the king, and Joab said, Today thy servant knows that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the word of his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the king said, Let him go to his own house and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and did not see the king's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in all Israel there was no one to be so greatly praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he shaved his head (for it was at every year's end that he shaved [it]: because [the hair] was heavy on him, therefore, he shaved it), the hair of his head weighed two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And unto Absalom there were born three sons and one daughter, whose name [was] Tamar, who was a beautiful woman to behold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem and did not see the king's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore, Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him; and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Joab arose and came to Absalom unto [his] house and said unto him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I have sent for thee, saying, Come here, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why have I come from Geshur? [It would have been] better for me [to have been] there still. Now, therefore, let me see the king's face; and if there is [any] iniquity in me, let him kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Joab came to the king and told him. Then he called Absalom, who came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
