Every man to his tents, O Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So all the men of Israel went up from after David [and] followed Sheba, the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah cleaved unto their king from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And [when] David came to his house at Jerusalem, the king took the ten women, [his] concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward and fed them, but did not go in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah for the third day, and be thou here present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Amasa went to assemble [the men of] Judah, but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said to Abishai, Now Sheba, the son of Bichri, shall do us more harm than Absalom; take thou thy lord's servants and pursue after him lest he find fenced cities and escape us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Joab's men went out after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba, the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they [were] at the great stone which [is] in Gibeon, Amasa came out and met them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him and upon it a girdle [with] a sword fastened upon his loins in its sheath, and as he went forth, it fell out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joab said to Amasa, [Art] thou in peace, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Amasa took no heed of the sword that [was] in Joab's hand; and he smote him with it in the fifth [rib], and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai, his brother, pursued after Sheba, the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And one of Joab's servants stood by him, and said, He that favours Joab and he that [is] for David, [let him go] after Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Amasa had wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stopped, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a garment upon him because he saw that every one that came by him stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he was removed out of the highway, all the people that followed Joab passed on, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel and to Bethmaachah and all the Berites; and they were gathered together and also went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and [the people] went against the wall; and all the people that [were] with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then a wise woman cried out in the city, Hear, hear, I pray you, tell Joab to come here, that I may speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he had come near unto her, the woman said, [Art] thou Joab? And he answered, I [am he]. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then she spoke, saying, They used to speak in old times, saying, If you have a question ask it at Abel; and so they concluded [the matter].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I]am one of those that are] peaceable [and] faithful in Israel, and thou seekest to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel; why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The matter [is] not so, but a man of Mount Ephraim, Sheba, the son of Bichri, by name, has lifted up his hand against king David; give only him over, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba, the son of Bichri, and cast [it] out to Joab. And he blew the shofar, and they retired from the city, each one to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Joab [remained] over all the host of Israel, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, [was] over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Adoram [was] over the tribute, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, [was] writer of the chronicles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and Sheva [was] scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar [were] the priests;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and Ira, the Jairite, was David's priest.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
