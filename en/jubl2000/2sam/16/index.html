And Ziba said, The asses [are] for the king's household to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the servants to eat, and the wine that those that become weary in the wilderness may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, And where [is] thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem, for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, thine [are] all that [pertained] unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba bowed down and said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when King David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came forth, whose name [was] Shimei, the son of Gera; he came forth cursing</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and casting stones at David and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men [were] on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the LORD has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom, thy son; and, behold, thou [art taken] in thy evil because thou [art] a bloody man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse, my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD has said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why hast thou done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth of my bowels, seeks my life; how much more now a son of Jemini? Let him alone, and let him curse, for the LORD has bidden him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the side of the mountain over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king and all the people that [were] with him arrived weary and refreshed themselves there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass when Hushai the Archite, David's special companion, came unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Absalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy mercy to thy friend? Why didst thou not go with thy friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Hushai said unto Absalom, No, but whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And again, whom should I serve? [Should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? As I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then the hands of all that [are] with thee shall be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house, and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, [was] as if a man had enquired at the word of God: so [was] all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
