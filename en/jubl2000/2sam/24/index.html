And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And passing the Jordan, they pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that [lies] in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After that they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtimhodshi, and they came to Danjaan and about to Zidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then they came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and they went out towards the Negev from Judah, [even] to Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when they had gone through all the land, they returned to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king, and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword, and the men of Judah [were] five hundred thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in having done this; but now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in the morning when David had risen, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go and say unto David, Thus hath the LORD said, I offer thee three [things]: choose one of them, which I will do unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Gad came to David and told him and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? Or wilt thou flee three months before thy enemies while they pursue thee? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the hand of the LORD, for his mercies [are] great, and let me not fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the time appointed, and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD himself repented of that evil and said to the angel that was destroying the people, It is enough; stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingfloor of Araunah, the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David spoke unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people and said, I have sinned, I committed the iniquity, but these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me and against my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Gad came that day to David and said unto him, Go up, erect an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah, the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David went up, according to the word of Gad, as the LORD had commanded [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him, and Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? And David answered, To buy this threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what [seems] good unto him; behold, [here are] oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and [other] instruments of the oxen for wood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all these [things] does king Araunah give unto the King. Then Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said unto Araunah, No, but I will surely buy [it] of thee at a price, for I will not offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which costs me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David built there an altar unto the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace [offerings]. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
