And he said, Thy servant [is] of one of the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Absalom would say unto them, See, thy matters [are] good and just; but [there is] no one [delegated] by the king to hear thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Absalom would say, Oh, that I were made judge in the land, that everyone who has any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was so, that when anyone came near [unto him] to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Absalom did according to this manner with all Israel that came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of those of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And at the end of [a predetermined period of] forty years, it came to pass that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go to Hebron and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose and went to Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the shofar, then ye shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And two hundred men of Jerusalem went with Absalom, [that were] invited [by him], and they went in their integrity, without knowing anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Absalom also sent for Ahithophel, the Gilonite, of David's counsel, from his city, [even] from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the word came to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then David said unto all his servants that [were] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee, for we shall not [otherwise] escape from Absalom; make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants [are ready to do] whatever my lord the king shall choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king went forth and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, [who were] concubines, to keep the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king went forth and all the people after him and stopped in a place that was far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all his servants passed to his side, and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come on foot [with him] from Gath, went before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the king said to Ittai, the Gittite, Why dost thou also go also with us? Return to thy place and abide with the king; for thou [art] a stranger and also an exile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whereas thou didst come [but] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? Seeing I go where I go, return thou and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth [are] in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ittai answered the king and said, As the LORD lives and [as] my lord the king lives, for life or for death, wherever my lord the king shall be, there also will thy servant be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David said to Ittai, Go, therefore, and pass. And Ittai, the Gittite, passed and all his men and all the little ones that [were] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all those of the land wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed the brook Kidron; and then the king also passed, and all the people passed unto the way of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold Zadok also and with him all the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of God, and they set down the ark of God. And Abiathar went up after all the people had finished leaving the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find grace in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again and show me [both] it and his tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if he should say, I have no delight in thee; behold, [here] I [am], let him do to me as seems good unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king said also unto Zadok, the priest, [Art not] thou a seer? Return into the city in peace and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz, thy son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until you send word to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem, and they remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And David went up by the ascent of [Mount] Olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered, and he went barefoot. And all the people that [were] with him covered each one his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it was told David, saying, Ahithophel [is] among the conspirators with Absalom. Then David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass that [when] David came to the top [of the mount] to worship God there, behold, Hushai, the Archite came to meet him, with his coat rent and earth upon his head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Unto whom David said, If thou pass on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but if thou return to the city and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king [as] I [have been] thy father's servant until now, so [will] I now also [be] thy servant; then thou may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Are not Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, there with thee? Therefore, it shall be [that] whatever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell [it] to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Behold, [they have] there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's [son], and Jonathan, Abiathar's [son]; and by them you shall send unto me everything that you hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So Hushai, David's special companion came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
