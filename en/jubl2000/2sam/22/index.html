in him will I trust: [he is] my shield and the horn of my saving health; my defence and my refuge; my saviour, who shall save me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will call on the LORD, [who is] worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of Belial made me afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[when] the cords of Sheol compassed me about; the snares of death came before me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>in my distress I called upon the LORD and cried to my God, who heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry [entered] into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the heavens were moved and shook because he was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Smoke went up from his nostrils, and fire devoured out of his mouth; coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he lowered the heavens and came down, and darkness [was] under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he rode upon a cherub and flew; and he appeared upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He placed darkness like tabernacles round about him, dark waters [and] thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From the brightness of his presence, coals of fire were kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD thundered from the heavens, and the most High uttered his voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>he sent out arrows and scattered them; he lightninged, and consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the springs of the sea appeared and the foundations of the world were uncovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He extended [his hand] from above, he took me; he drew me out of the impetuous waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>he delivered me from strong enemies, from those that hated me, who were stronger than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came upon me unawares in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He brought me forth into a large place; he delivered me, because he had put his will in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I have all his ordinances before me and am attentive to his statutes; I will not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I was perfect before him and have kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness before his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the merciful thou art good, [and] with the perfect thou art upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With the pure thou art pure, and with the perverse thou art an adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou wilt save the poor [in spirit]; but thine eyes [are] upon the haughty [that] thou may bring [them] down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For thou [art] my lamp, O LORD, and the LORD gives light unto my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in thee I have run through a troop; with my God I have gone over the walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[As for] God, his way [is] perfect; the word of the LORD [is] purified; he [is] a shield to all those that trust in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For what God [is there] except the LORD? Or who [is] a Strong One, except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God [is] he who strengthens me with virtue; he who clears my way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>he who makes my feet like hinds' [feet], and he who sets me upon my high places;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>he who trains my hands for war and [causes] my arms to break the bow of bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy saving health, and thy meekness has multiplied me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my knees did not shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them and did not return until I had consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I consumed them and wounded them, and they did not arise; they are fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thou hast girded me with strength for the battle; thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thou hast given me the necks of my enemies, of those that hate me, that I might cut them off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, but [there was] no one to save them; [even] unto the LORD, but he did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth; I stamped them as the mire of the street [and] spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of peoples; thou hast kept me [to be] head of the Gentiles; peoples [whom] I did not know have served me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The strangers trembled [before] my [command]; as soon as they heard, they obeyed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The strangers withered away and trembled in their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The LORD lives, and blessed [be] my rock, and exalted be the God [who is] the rock of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The God who has given me revenge and who subjects the peoples under me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>who brings me forth from among my enemies; thou hast lifted me up on high from among those that rose up against me; thou hast delivered me from the man of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore, I will confess thee among the Gentiles, O LORD, and I will sing unto thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He who makes great the saving health of his king and shows mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for ever.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
