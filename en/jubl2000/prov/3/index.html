bind them about thy neck; write them upon the tablet of thine heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So shalt thou find grace and good favour in the sight of God and man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the LORD and depart from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It shall be medicine to thy navel and marrow to thy bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honour the LORD with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the LORD chastens whom he loves and delights in, even as a father to his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Blessed [is] the man [that] has found wisdom and who brings [to light] intelligence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for the merchandise of it [is] better than the merchandise of silver and the fruits thereof more than fine gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She [is] more precious than precious stones, and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Length of days [is] in her right hand [and] in her left hand riches and honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, and all her paths [are] peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She [is a] tree of life to those that lay hold upon her, and blessed [is every one] that retains her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by intelligence has he established the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the heavens drop down the dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, do not let them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: [yea], thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou shall not be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked when it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the LORD shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do not say unto thy neighbour, Go and come again and tomorrow I will give when thou hast it by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Do not devise evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwells securely by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do not sue a man without cause, if he has done thee no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the perverse [is an] abomination to the LORD; but his secret [is] with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The curse of the LORD [is] in the house of the wicked, but he shall bless the habitation of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Surely he scorns the scorners;
