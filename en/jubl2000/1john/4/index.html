By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another, for charity is of God. Anyone that loves is born of God and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that does not love does not know God, for God is charity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this was the charity of God demonstrated in us, in that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this does the charity consist, not because we had loved God, but because he loved us and has sent his Son [to be] the reconciliation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and his charity is completed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, in that he has given us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we have known and believed the charity that God has in us. God is charity, and he that abides in charity abides in God, and God in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In this the charity with us is made perfect, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, that as he is, so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In charity there is no fear; but charity that is perfect casts out fear; because fear has torment; from which he that fears is not complete in charity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love him, because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If anyone says, I love God and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he that does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And we have this commandment from him, That he who loves God loves his brother also.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
