For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might undo the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this the sons of God are manifest, and the sons of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness and that loves not his brother is not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, That we should love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not as Cain, [who] was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we are passed from death unto life, in that we love the brethren. He that does not love [his] brother abides in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In this we have known the charity [of God] because he laid down his life for us; we also ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whosoever has this world's goods and sees his brother have need and shuts up his bowels [of compassion] from him, how does the charity of God abide in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My little children, let us not love in word neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in this we know that we are of the truth and have our hearts certified before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, [then] we have confidence in God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he has commanded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him.
