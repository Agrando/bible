The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which is the truth in him and in you, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He that says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he that hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and does not know where he goes, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I write unto you, little children, that your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write unto you, fathers, that ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, that ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, that ye have known the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have written unto you, fathers, that ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, that ye are strong and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Love not the world neither the things [that are] in the world. If anyone loves the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the world passes away and the lust thereof, but he that does the will of God abides for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, it is the last hour, and as ye have heard that the antichrist shall come, likewise there are also beginning to be many antichrists, by which we know that it is the last time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would [no doubt] have continued with us; but [this happened] that it might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But ye have the anointing of the Holy One, and ye know all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not written unto you as if ye ignore the truth, but as unto those that know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? This same is antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whosoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. Whosoever confesses the Son, has the Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. For if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall abide in you, ye also shall [continue to] abide in the Son and in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the promise that he has promised us, [even] eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>These [things] I have written unto you concerning those that seduce you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you, and ye do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth, and is no lie; and even as it has taught you, abide ye in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If ye know that he is righteous, also know that any one that does righteousness is born of him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
