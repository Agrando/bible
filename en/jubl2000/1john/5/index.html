And the Spirit is he that bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree in one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that believes in the Son of God has the witness of God in himself; he that does not believe God has made God a liar; because he does not believe the witness that God has testified of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the witness that God has given eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that has the Son has life; [and] he that does not have the Son of God does not have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things I have written unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence that we have in God, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we also know that we have the petitions that we asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man see his brother sin a sin [which is] not unto death, he shall ask [God], and he shall give him life [that is], unto those that do not sin unto death.
