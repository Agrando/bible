in whom, though at present ye see [him] not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>receiving the end of your faith, [even] the saving health of your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Of which saving health the prophets, (who prophesied of the grace that was to come in you) have enquired and searched diligently;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>searching when and in what point of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, which announced beforehand the afflictions that were to come upon the Christ, and the glory that should follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us they did administer the things, which are now announced unto you by those that have preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven, which things the angels desire to look into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, having the loins of your understanding girded with temperance, wait perfectly in the grace that is presented unto you when Jesus, the Christ, is manifested unto you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as obedient sons, not conforming yourselves with the former desires that you had before in your ignorance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but as he who has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if ye invoke as Father, he who without respect of persons judges according to the work of each one, converse in fear the entire time of your sojourning [here],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>knowing that ye have been ransomed from your vain conversation (which you received from your fathers), not with corruptible things [like] silver and gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with the precious blood of the Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without contamination,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>already ordained from before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for love of you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who by him do believe God, who raised him up from the dead and has given him glory: that your faith and hope might be in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Having purified your souls in the obedience of the truth, by the Spirit, in unfeigned brotherly love, love one another with a pure heart fervently,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but the word of the Lord endures for ever.
