And she constrained us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a Pythian spirit met us, which brought her masters much gain by divination:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>she followed Paul and us and cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who announce unto us the way of saving health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she did this [for] many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas and drew [them] into the marketplace unto the rulers</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and teach rites which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe, being Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But at midnight as Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God, and the prisoners heard them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the keeper of the prison, awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he called for a light and came inside and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed [their] stripes and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the keeper of the prison made these words known unto Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore depart and go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast [us] into prison; and now do they thrust us out in secret? no indeed; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the sergeants returned and told these words unto the magistrates; and they feared when they heard that they were Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they came and besought them, and bringing [them] out, asked [them] to depart out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And leaving the prison, they entered into [the house of] Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
