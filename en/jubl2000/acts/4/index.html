for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them [is] manifest to all those that dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them that from now on they speak to no man in this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Peter and John answered and said unto them, Judge whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way how they might punish them because of the people, for everyone glorified God for that which was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being let go, they went to their own company and reported all that the princes of the priests and the elders had said unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, thou [art the] God, who hast made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who (in the Holy Spirit) by the mouth of thy servant David (our father) hast said, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth were present, and the princes were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For of a truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together (in this city),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do that which thy hand and thy counsel had determined beforehand must be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that thou might stretch forth thine hand so that healings and signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy servant Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And of the multitude of those that had believed was one heart and one soul; no one said that anything he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Neither was there any among them that lacked, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and laid [them] down at the apostles' feet; and distribution was made unto each one according to their need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation), a Levite, [and] of the country of Cyprus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>having land, sold [it] and brought the money and laid [it] at the apostles' feet.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
