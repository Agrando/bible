And when the Jews laid [in] wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he took counsel to return through Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These going before tarried for us at Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the first of the sabbaths, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart the next day, and continued his word until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were many lamps in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a certain young man named Eutychus sat in a window, being fallen into a deep sleep; and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Paul went down and fell on him and, embracing [him], said, Trouble not yourselves, for his soul is [still] in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while, even until day break, thus he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they took the young man [home] alive and were greatly comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And we went into the ship and sailed unto Assos, intending to take in Paul there, for so he had determined that he should go by land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And we sailed from there and came the next [day] over against Chios, and the next [day] we arrived in port at Samos; and having rested in Trogyllium, the next [day] we came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, not to detain himself in Asia, for he hasted to keep the day of Pentecost, if it were possible for him, in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord with all humility and with many tears and temptations, which have befallen me by the ambushes of the Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[and] how I kept back nothing that was profitable [unto you], but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to the Jews and also to the Gentiles, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, behold, I go bound of the Spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that prisons and tribulations await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear unto myself, only that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I take you to record this day that I [am] pure from the blood of everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I have not refrained from declaring unto you the full counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit has placed you as bishops to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know this, that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Also from among your own selves, men shall arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is powerful to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Moreover, ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to those that were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have showed you [in] all things how that so labouring, ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he had thus spoken, he knelt down and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then they all wept sore and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>sorrowing most of all for the word which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
