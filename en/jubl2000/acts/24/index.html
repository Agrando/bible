by examining of whom thou may take knowledge of all these things, of which we accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because thou art able to understand that there have been but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>neither can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call [a] sect, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And for this reason do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and [toward] men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had anything against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Or else let these same [here] say if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>except it be for this one voice, that I cried out standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead, I am called in question by you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Felix heard these things, he deferred them, saying, I shall have more information regarding [that] way, when Lysias the tribunal shall come down, [Then] I will know the uttermost of your matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his own to minister or come unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after certain days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard of him the faith which is in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, Go away for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He hoped also that money should have been given him from Paul, that he might loose him; therefore he sent for him many times and communed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But after two years Felix received Porcius Festus as successor;
