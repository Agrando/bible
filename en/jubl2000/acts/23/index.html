but the Pharisees confess both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there arose a great cry; and the scribes [that were] of the Pharisees' part arose and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man, but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when there arose a great dissension, the tribunal, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring [him] into the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the night following the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer, Paul, for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou also bear witness at Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together and they vowed under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they were more than forty who had made this conspiracy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they came to the princes of the priests and the elders and said, We have made a vow of anathema that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore ye with the council signify to the tribunal that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though ye would enquire something more certain concerning him, and we, before he arrives, are ready to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, he went and entered into the fortress and told Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Paul called one of the centurions unto [him] and said, Bring this young man unto the tribunal, for he has a certain thing to tell him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he took him and brought [him] to the tribunal and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto [him] and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who has something to say unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the tribunal took him by the hand and went [with him] aside privately and asked [him], What is that thou hast to tell me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee that thou would bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they would enquire something more certain of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But do not believe them, for more than forty of them lie in wait [to ambush] him, who have vowed under a curse that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, looking for a promise from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the tribunal [then] let the young man depart and charged [him, See thou] tell no one that thou hast showed these things to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he called unto [him] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and provide [them] beasts that they may set Paul on and bring [him] safe unto Felix the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he wrote a letter after this manner:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix [sends] greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man was taken of the Jews and should have been killed by them; then I came with an army and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when I desired to know the cause of why they accused him, I brought him forth into their council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>whom I found to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when it was told me how the Jews lay [in] wait to [ambush] the man, I sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what [they had] against him. Farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought [him] by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the fortress,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that [he was] of Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgement hall.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
