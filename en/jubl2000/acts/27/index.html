And Julius courteously entreated Paul and gave [him] liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, and he put us in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not allowing us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and, passing it with difficulty, came unto a place which is called The Fair Havens, near which was the city [of] Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished [them],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, many were in agreement to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice [and] winter [there, which is] a port of Crete and lies toward Africa and the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained [their] purpose, raising [sails], they sailed close by Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the ship was caught up [by it] and could not resist against the wind, [the ship] was taken by [the wind and] drifted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into Syrtis, struck sail and so were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the third [day] with our own hands we cast off the dead works of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on [us], all hope that we should be saved was then lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete to have avoided this harm and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of any person's life among you, but only of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the angel of God stood by me this night, whose I am and whom I serve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar; and, behold, God has given thee all those that sail with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>However we must be cast upon a certain island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic sea, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and sounded and found [it] twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again and found [it] fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought [them] all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have waited and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore I pray you to take [some] food, for this is for your [salvation and] health, for there shall not one hair fall from the head of any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread and gave thanks to God in presence of them all; and when he had broken [it], he began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then they were all of good cheer, and they also took [some] food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And we were in all, in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and cast out the grain into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they discovered a certain gulf with a shore, into which they decided, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed [themselves] unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, frustrated this counsel and commanded that those who could swim should cast [themselves] first [into the sea] and get to land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the rest, some on boards and some on [broken pieces] of the ship. And so it came to pass that they were all saved [by making it] to land.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
