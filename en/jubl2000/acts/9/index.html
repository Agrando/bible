And the Lord said, I AM Jesus whom thou dost persecute; [it is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord [said] unto him, Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what it behooves thee to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice, but seeing no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Saul arose from the earth; and opening his eyes, he saw no one; so they led him by the hand and brought [him] into Damascus</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>where he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; to whom the Lord said in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I [am here], Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord [said] unto him, Arise and go into the street which is called Straight and enquire in the house of Judas for [one] called Saul, of Tarsus; for, behold, he prays</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting [his] hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, [of] how much evil he has done to thy saints in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and even here he has authority from the princes of the priests to bind all that call on thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord said unto him, Go; for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for I will show him how much it behooves him to suffer for my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Ananias went and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared unto thee in the way as thou didst come, has sent me, that thou might receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales; and he received sight immediately and arose and was baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had received food, he was comforted. Then Saul was certain days with the disciples who were at Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all that heard [him] were amazed and said, Is not this he that destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem and came here for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the princes of the priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as many days passed, the Jews took counsel among themselves to kill him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but their ambushes were understood by Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the disciples took him by night and let [him] down by the wall in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him and did not believe that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas took him and brought [him] to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Greeks; but they went about to slay him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>[which] when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the churches had rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria and were edified, walking in the fear of the Lord, and with the comfort of the Holy Spirit they were multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all [quarters], he came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been in bed eight years, for he was a paralytic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, the Lord Jesus, the Christ, makes thee whole; arise and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas; this woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died, whom when they had washed, they laid [her] in an upper chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And since as Lydda was close to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, asking [him] that he not delay to come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made them while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then Peter put them all out and knelt down and prayed and turned to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave her [his] hand and lifted her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And it came to pass that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
