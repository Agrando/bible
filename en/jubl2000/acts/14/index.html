And he leaped and walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius because he was the chief speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the priest of Jupiter, who was before their city, brought bulls and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice unto them with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>[Which] when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard [of it], they rent their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things that are therein,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who in generations past suffered all the Gentiles to walk in their own ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with these words they scarcely restrained the people, that they not sacrifice unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And [certain] Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew [him] out of the city, supposing he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came into the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra and [to] Iconium and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>confirming the souls of the disciples [and] exhorting them to remain in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having ordained elders for them in every church and having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and from there sailed to Antioch, where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they were come and had gathered the church together, they related what great things God had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there they abode [a] long time with the disciples.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
