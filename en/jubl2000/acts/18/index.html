And Gallio cared for none of those things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed from there into Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he came to Ephesus and left them there, but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they desired [him] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem, but I will return again unto you, if God wills. And he sailed from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had landed at Caesarea and gone up [to Jerusalem] and after greeting the church, he went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had spent some time [there], he departed and went over [all] the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, teaching only in the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Aquila and Priscilla had heard him, they took him unto [them] and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the exhorted brethren wrote the disciples to receive him, who, when he was come, was very helpful through grace unto those who had believed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for he mightily convinced the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
