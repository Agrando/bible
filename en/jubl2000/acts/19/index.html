And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there is any Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said unto them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ, Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they heard [this], they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Paul had laid [his] hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all the men were about twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he went into the synagogue and spoke freely for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some were hardened and disobedient, but cursing the way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this continued by the space of two years so that all those who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon themselves to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(And there were seven sons of [one] Sceva, a Jew [and] prince of the priests, who did so.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with, but who are ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And many that believed came, confessing and declaring their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the same manner many who had practiced vain arts brought their books together and burned them before everyone, and they counted the price of them and found [it] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the word of God grew mightily and prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After these things were ended, Paul purposed by [the] Spirit to go to Jerusalem, after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, After I have been there, it behooves me to see Rome also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So he sent into Macedonia two of those that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the same time there arose no small stir about the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For a certain [man] named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said, Sirs, ye know that by this gain we have our wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when they heard [these sayings], they were full of wrath and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the whole city was filled with confusion, and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And certain of the chief [persons] of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, asking [him] that he not present himself in the theatre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused; and most of them did not know why they were come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defense unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then the [town] scribe, appeasing the people, said, [Ye] men of Ephesus, what man is there that does not know how the city of the Ephesians is honored of the great goddess Diana and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For ye have brought here these men, who are neither [guilty of] sacrilege, nor blasphemers of your goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we are in danger of being accused of sedition for this day's uproar, there being no cause by which we may give an account of this concourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
