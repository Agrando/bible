For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, Let the will of the Lord be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after those days we packed our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There went with us also [certain] of the disciples of Caesarea and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the [day] following, Paul went in with us to [see] James, and all the elders were gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they heard [it], they glorified the Lord and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous of the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise [their] children, neither to walk after the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together, for they will hear that thou art come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men among us who have a vow on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>them take, and purify thyself with them, and pay their expenses, that they may shave [their] heads, and all may know that those things, of which they were informed concerning thee, are nothing, but [that] thou thyself dost also walk orderly and keep the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As touching the Gentiles who believe, we have written [and] concluded that they observe no such thing, except only that they keep themselves from [things] offered to idols and from blood and from [that which has been] strangled and from fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men and the next day, purifying himself with them, entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until an offering should be offered for each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews, who were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>crying out, Men of Israel, help; this is the man that teaches everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place and further brought Greeks also into the temple and has polluted this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For before [this] they had seen Trophimus, an Ephesian, with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So that all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they took Paul and drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the tribunal of the company that all Jerusalem was in an uproar</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them; and when they saw the tribunal and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the tribunal came near and took him and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains and demanded [to know] who he was and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers because of the violence of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as Paul was to be led into the fortress, he said unto the tribunal, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days made an uproar and led four thousand men out into the wilderness that were murderers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am certainly a Jew, a citizen of Tarsus, a city known in Cilicia; and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people.
