Then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I esteem myself blessed, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee concerning all the things of which I am accused of the Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>especially [because I know] thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews; therefore, I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My manner of life from my youth, which from the beginning was among my own nation at Jerusalem, is known of all the Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most perfect sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>unto which [promise] our twelve tribes, constantly serving [God] day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I verily had thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Which things I also did in Jerusalem, and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the princes of the priests, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the princes of the priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? [It is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>delivering thee from the people and [from] the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among those who are sanctified by the faith that is in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but I announced first unto those of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of Judaea and [then] to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill [me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Having, therefore, obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said should come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Christ should suffer [and] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto this people and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as he spoke these things and [answered] for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth words of truth and temperance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king knows of these things, before whom I also speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, dost thou believe the prophets? I know that thou believest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul said, I desire before God that by little or by much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were such as I am, except these bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when he had said these things, the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and those that sat with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto Caesar.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
