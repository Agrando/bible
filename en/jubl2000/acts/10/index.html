And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now send men to Joppa and call for [one] Simon, whose surname is Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side; he shall tell thee what it behooves thee to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the angel who spoke unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those that waited on him continually;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and when he had declared all [these] things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On the morrow, as they went on their journey and drew near unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and he became very hungry and would have eaten; but while they made ready, he fell into a rapture of understanding</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in which were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and reptiles and fowls of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the voice [spoke] unto him again the second time, That which God has cleansed, do not call common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This was done three times, and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house and stood before the gate</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Arise therefore and get thee down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter went down to the men who were sent unto him from Cornelius and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek; what [is] the cause for which ye are come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man and one that fears God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he called them in and lodged [them]. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many that were come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an abominable thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I came [unto you] without doubting, as soon as I was sent for; I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa, and call here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of [one] Simon a tanner by the sea side, who, when he comes, shall speak unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well to come. Now therefore we are all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Peter opened [his] mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The word which [God] sent unto the sons of Israel, preaching the gospel: peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>that word, [I say], ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of Judea and in Jerusalem, whom they slew hanging him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>This same [one] God raised up the third day and showed him openly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, [even] to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he who is ordained of God [to be] the Judge of living and dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Unto him all the prophets give witness, that whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins through his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that also on the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Can anyone forbid water that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they begged him to tarry certain days.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
