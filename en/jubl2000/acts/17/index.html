And some said, What will this babbler say? others, He seems to be a setter forth of new gods, because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took him and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine [is], of which thou speakest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thou bringest certain new things to our ears; we desire, therefore, to know what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, [Ye] men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed by and beheld your sanctuaries, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him I declare unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God that made the world and all the things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life and breath and all things</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and has made of one blood all the lineage of men to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the seasons (which he has limited) and the bounds of their habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they should seek the Lord, if in any manner they might [reach out to] touch him and find him though he is not far from each one of us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in him we live and move and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also of his lineage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being therefore of the lineage of God, we ought not to think that which is Divine is like unto gold or silver or stone, bearing the mark of art and man's imagination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the times of this ignorance God overlooked, but [he] now commands all men everywhere to repent</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by [that] man whom he has ordained; [of whom] he has given assurance unto all [men] in that he has raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; and others said, We will hear thee again of this [matter].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul departed from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But certain men believed and joined themselves with him, among whom [was] Dionysius of the Areopagus and a woman named Damaris and others with them.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
