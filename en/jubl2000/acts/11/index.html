Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said unto him, Send to Joppa and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who shall tell thee words, by which thou and all thy house shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, when he said, John indeed baptized in water, but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then, if God gave them the same gift as [he did] unto us, who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I should withstand God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard these things, they were silent and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted repentance unto life to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now those who were scattered abroad by the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word to no one except only unto the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they came into Antioch, spoke unto the Greeks, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas that he should go unto Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, when he came and had seen the grace of God, was glad and exhorted them all to remain in [their] purpose of heart in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass that for a whole year they gathered themselves together with the church and taught many people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of them named Agabus stood up and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine throughout all the world, which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the disciples, each one according to what he had, determined to send relief unto the brethren who dwelt in Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>which they likewise did and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
