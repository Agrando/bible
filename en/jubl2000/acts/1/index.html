This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [the son] of Alphaeus and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of James were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said (the number of names together were about one hundred and twenty),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men [and] brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who was guide to those that took Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained a lot [or inheritance] of this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He, therefore, purchased a field with the reward of [his] iniquity; and hanging himself, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it was known unto all the dwellers of Jerusalem, in such a manner that the field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no one dwell therein, and let another take his office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It behooves, therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the baptism of John unto that same day that he was received on high from [among] us, that one must be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of everyone, show which of these two thou hast chosen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that he may take the lot [or inheritance] of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas rebelled that he might go to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
