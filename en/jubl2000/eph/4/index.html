and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the perfecting of the saints in the work of the ministry, unto [the] edifying of the body of the Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>until we all come forth in [the] unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the coming of age of the Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That we no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men [and] cunning craftiness, by which they lie in wait to deceive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but following the truth in charity, let us grow up into him in all things, who is the head, the Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From whom the whole body fitly joined together and [well] tied together among itself by the nourishment that every [connecting] bond supplies, by the operation of each member according to measure they have received, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in charity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This I say, therefore, and require in the Lord that from now on ye not walk as the other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their [own] senses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who, after losing all sense [of feeling] have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But ye have not so learned of the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>that ye put off [everything] concerning the old way of life, [that is], the old man who corrupts himself according to deceitful desires,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and be renewed in the spirit of your understanding</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and that ye put on the new man, which is created in conformity to God in righteousness and in the holiness of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, leaving the lie, speak every man truth with his neighbour, for we are members one of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Be ye angry and sin not;
