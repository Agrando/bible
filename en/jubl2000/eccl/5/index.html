Why [should thou cause] God to be angry because of thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because dreams abound, and vanities and the words are many, but fear thou God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If thou seest violence unto the poor and [the] extortion of rights and justice in a province, do not marvel at the matter, for height is looking upon height; and [there is] one higher than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there is higher [authority] in all of the things of the earth, [but] he who serves the field is king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that loves money shall not be satisfied with money; nor he that loves abundance with increase; this [is] also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When goods increase, those that eat them are increased; and what good [is there] to the owners thereof, except the beholding [of them] with their eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sleep of the servant [is] sweet whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is [another] sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely], riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>which are lost by evil pursuits and to the sons which he has begotten; [there is] nothing left in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this also [is] a sore evil; [that] in all points as he came, so shall he go; and what profit has he that has laboured for the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In addition to this, all the days of his life he shall eat in darkness, with much wrath and pain and sorrow sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold therefore the good which I have seen: that good is to eat and to drink and to enjoy of the good of all his labour that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him; for it [is] his portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Likewise, unto every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, he has also given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour; this [is] the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To such a one, God will remove the concerns common [to others], for God shall answer [him] with joy from his heart.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
