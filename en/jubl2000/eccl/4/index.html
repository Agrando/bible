This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better [is] a handful [with] rest than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I returned, and I saw [another] vanity under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It is the [man] who is alone, without a successor, who has neither son nor brother; yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity and sore travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Two [are] better than one because they have a better reward for their labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him [that is] alone when he falls, for [he has] not another to help him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Again, if two sleep together, then they have heat, but how can one be warm [alone]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no longer be admonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For he came out of prison to reign, even though he was born poor into his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I saw all the living who are under the sun walking with the child, the successor that shall stand up in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[There is] no end of all the people that have been before them; those also that come after shall not be content in him.
