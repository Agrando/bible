[even] that which has already been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I have seen that wisdom excels folly as far as light excels darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wise man [has] his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness: And I myself also understood that one event happens to the one and to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[Then] I said in my heart, As it shall happen to the fool, so it shall happen even to me. Why have I worked until now to make myself wiser? Then I said in my heart that this also [is] vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever, seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And also the wise [man] shall die the same as the fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Therefore] I hated life because [every] work that is wrought under the sun [was] grievous unto me; for all [was] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[Yea], I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun, which I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knows whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool, he who shall have rule over all my labour in which I have laboured and in which I have showed myself wise under the sun? This [is] also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore my heart began to despair again regarding all the labour which I took under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That the man who worked with wisdom and with knowledge and with uprightness would have to leave his portion to a man that has not laboured therein. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what does man have of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart in which he has laboured under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days [are only] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This is also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[There is] nothing better for a man [than] that he should eat and drink and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. I also have seen that this [is] from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who can eat, or who can care for himself better than I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For God gives to the man that [is] good in [his] sight wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to the one that is good before [God]. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
