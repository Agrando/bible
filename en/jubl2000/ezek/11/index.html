Then I fell down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Son of man, thy brethren, [even] thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel together, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD; unto us is this land given in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will even gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall come there, and they shall remove all her contaminations and all her abominations from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and fulfil them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But [as for those] whose heart walks after the desire of their contaminations and of their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings and the wheels after them; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Afterwards the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into the land of the Chaldeans to the captives.
