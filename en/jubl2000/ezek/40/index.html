and he stood in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set thine heart upon all that I show thee for to the intent that I might show [them] unto thee [art] thou brought here: declare all that thou dost see to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold a wall on the outside of the house, and the measuring reed which that man had in his hand, was six cubits [long], of a cubit and a hand breadth; so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he came unto the gate which looks toward the east and went up the stairs thereof and measured the post of the gate, [which was] one reed broad; and the other post [of the gate], [which was] one reed broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And [each] chamber [was] one reed long and one reed broad; and between the chambers [were] five cubits; and [each] post of the gate by the porch of the gate within [was] one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He also measured the porch of the gate within, one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he measured the entrance of the portal, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the entrance of the portal within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the gate eastward [had] three chambers on each side, they three [were] of one measure; and the portals were also of one measure on each side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; [and] the length of the portal, thirteen cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The space also before the chambers [was] one cubit [on this side], and the space [was] one cubit on that side; and the chambers [were] six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He measured then the gate from the roof of [one] chamber to the roof of another; the breadth [was] twenty-five cubits, door against door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He also made the portals of sixty cubits, each portal of the court and of the portal all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate [were] fifty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And [there were] narrow windows in the chambers, and in their portals within the gate round about, and likewise in the arches; and the windows [were] round about inward; and upon [each] post [were] palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he brought me into the outer court, and, behold, [there were] chambers and a pavement made for the court round about; thirty chambers [were] in that court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the lower pavement [was] paved to the side of the gates, in proportion to the length of the portals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, one hundred cubits eastward and northward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the gate of the outer court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And its chambers [were] three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate; its length [was] fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And their windows and their arches and their palm trees [were] after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and its arches [were] before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the gate of the inner court [was] over against the gate toward the north and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south; and he measured its portals and its arches according to these measures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And [there were] windows in it and in its arches round about, like those windows; the length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And [there were] seven steps to go up to it, and its arches [were] before them; and it had palm trees, one on this side and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And [thus was the] gate in the inner court toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south one hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to these measures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and its chambers, and its posts and its arches according to these measures; and [there were] windows in it and in its arches round about; [it was] fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the arches round about [were] twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And its arches [went] into the court outside, with palm trees upon [each of] its posts; and the going up to it [had] eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he brought me into the inner court toward the east; and he measured the gate according to these measures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And its chambers and its posts and its arches [were] according to these measures; and [there were] windows therein and in its arches round about; [it was] fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And its arches [went] into the court outside, with palm trees upon [each of] its posts, on this side and on that side; and the going up to it [had] eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he brought me to the north gate and measured [it] according to these measures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>its chambers, its posts and its arches and the windows to it round about: the length [was] fifty cubits and the breadth twenty-five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And its posts [were] toward the outer court; with palm trees upon [each of] its posts, on this side and on that side: and the going up to it [had] eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And [there was] a chamber and its gate with posts of portals, there they shall wash the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And in the porch of the gate [were] two tables on this side and two tables on that side, to slay the burnt offering upon and the sin and the guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And to the outside of the steps at the entry of the north gate [were] two tables; and on the other side, which [was] at the porch of the gate, [were] two tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Four tables [were] on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of this gate; eight tables, upon which they slew [their sacrifices].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the four tables [were] of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; upon which they also laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And within [were] hooks, a hand broad, fastened round about; and upon the tables [was] the flesh of the offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And outside the inner gate [were] the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which [was] at the side of the north gate; and they faced toward the south, one at the side of the east gate facing toward the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he said unto me, This chamber facing toward the south [shall be] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the chamber facing toward the north [shall be] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar; these [are] the sons of Zadok who are called from the sons of Levi to minister to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar [that was] before the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured [each] post of the porch five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate [was] three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The length of the porch [was] twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, into which they went in by steps; and [there were] pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
