and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the prophet when he is deceived and speaks a word, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from among my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall bear the [punishment of] their iniquity; the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeks [unto him]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that the house of Israel may no longer go astray from me, neither be polluted any longer in all their rebellions but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The word of the LORD came again to me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Son of man, when the land sins against me by rebelling blatantly and I stretch out my hand upon her and break the staff of the bread thereof and send famine upon her and cut off man and beast out of her</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in the midst of her, they should deliver [but] their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I cause an evil beast to pass through the land and destroy her so that it be desolate that there be no one to pass through because of the beast</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[though] these three men [were] in the midst of her, [as] I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither their sons nor their daughters; they only shall be delivered, and the land shall be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Or [if] I bring a sword upon the land and say: Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast out of her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>though these three men [were] in the midst of her, [as] I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither their sons nor their daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or [if] I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon her in blood to cut off out of her man and beast</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>though Noah, Daniel, and Job, [were] in the midst of her, [as] I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall [but] deliver their own souls by their righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: How much more if I send my four sore judgments against Jerusalem: the sword, the famine, the evil beast, the pestilence, to cut off out of her man and beast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant in her, of whom shall be taken captive your sons and daughters; they shall be taken away: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, [even] concerning all that I have brought upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in her, said the Lord GOD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
