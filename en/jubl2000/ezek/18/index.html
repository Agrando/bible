He shall not live; he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if he begets a son that sees all his father's sins which he has done and seeing them, does not do according to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[that] he does not eat upon the mountains, neither lifts up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defiles his neighbour's wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>neither oppresses any, nor withholds the pledge, neither commits robbery, [but] gives his bread to the hungry, and covers the naked with a garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>takes off his hand from [oppressing] the poor, does not receive usury nor increase, acts [according to] my rights, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[As for] his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did [that] which [is] not good among his people, behold, even he shall die for his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet if ye say, Why does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? Because the son has lived according to judgment and righteousness [and] has kept all my statutes and has done them, he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him [who is righteous], and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him [who is wicked].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed and keep all my statutes and live according to judgment and righteousness, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All his rebellions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him; by his righteousness that he has done he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do I desire perchance the death of the wicked? said the Lord GOD, Shall he not live if he should leave his ways?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if the righteous should leave his righteousness and commit iniquity, [and] do according to all the abominations that the wicked [man] does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned; by his rebellion in which he has trespassed and by his sin which he has committed, because of them he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if ye say, The way of the Lord is not straight. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not straight? Are not your ways crooked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When a righteous [man] leaves his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall die in it; for his iniquity that he has done he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, when the wicked [man] leaves his wickedness that he has committed and lives according to judgment and righteousness, he shall cause his soul to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because he saw and left all his rebellions that he has committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If even [now] the house of Israel should say, The way of the Lord is not straight. O house of Israel, are not my ways straight? Certainly your ways are not straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one according to his ways, said the Lord GOD. Repent and turn [yourselves] from all your iniquities, so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Cast away from you all your iniquities by which ye have rebelled, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I do not desire the death of him that dies, said the Lord GOD; therefore turn [yourselves], and ye shall live.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
