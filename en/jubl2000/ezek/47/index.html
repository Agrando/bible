Again he measured a thousand and brought me through; the waters [were] to the loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass over; for the waters were risen; a river that could not be passed over without swimming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this]? Then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as I turned, behold, at the bank of the river [were] very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country and shall go down into the desert and go into the sea: [which being] brought forth into the sea, the waters [of the sea] shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall come to pass, [that] every living soul, which swims wherever these two rivers shall come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because of these waters going there: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live that shall enter into this river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall come to pass, [that] the fishermen shall stand next to it; and from Engedi even unto Eneglaim there shall be a [place] to spread forth nets; according to their kinds, their fish shall be as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every [fruitful] tree for food, whose leaf shall not fall, neither shall its fruit be lacking; it shall bring forth mature fruit in its months, because their waters come forth out of the sanctuary; and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for medicine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: This is the border, by which ye shall divide the land in inheritance among to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [shall have two] portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, [concerning] that which I lifted up my hand that I must give it unto your fathers: therefore, this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this [shall be] the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which [is] between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which [is] by the coast of Hauran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the border of the north shall be from the sea of Hazarenan to the border of Damascus to the north, and to the border of Hamath to the side of the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to the east side through Hauran, and Damascus, and Gilead, and through the land of Israel to the Jordan, ye shall measure this from the border unto the east sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And to the south side southward from Tamar [even] to the waters of strife; from Kadesh and the river to the great sea. And [this shall be] the south side southward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to the west side the great sea shall be the border straight unto Hamath.
