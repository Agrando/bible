Shall he not pull [it] up its roots and destroy its fruit and let it wither? All of the leaves of her spring shall wither, even without great power or many people plucking it up by its roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[Yea], behold, [being] planted, shall it be prospered? Shall it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the furrows where it grew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Say now to the rebellious house: Do ye not know what these [things mean]? Tell [them], Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem and has taken its king and its princes and led them with him to Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and has taken of the seed of the kingdom and made a covenant with him and has brought him to an oath: he has also taken the mighty of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that the kingdom might be cast down, that it might not lift itself up, [but] that it might keep his covenant and stay in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors unto Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he be prospered, shall he that does such [things] escape? And shall he who broke the covenant be able to flee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely in the place [where] the king [dwells] that made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, [even] with him in the midst of Babylon, he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And not with a mighty army, nor with a great company shall Pharaoh do anything for him in the battle when they cast up mounts, and build forts to cut off many lives:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>seeing he despised the oath to invalidate the covenant when, behold, he had given his hand and has done all these [things], he shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised and my covenant that he has broken, even it will I turn upon his own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass with which he has rebelled against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all his fugitives with all his armies shall fall by the sword, and those that remain shall be scattered toward all winds; and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will also take of the highest branch of that high cedar and will set [it up]; I will crop off from the principal branch a shoot and will plant it upon the high and sublime mountain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>in the high mountain of Israel I will plant it, and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and become a magnificent cedar; and under it shall dwell every fowl; everything that flies shall dwell in the shadow of its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I the LORD have spoken and have done [it].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
