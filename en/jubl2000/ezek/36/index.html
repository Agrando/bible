and they shall multiply and grow; and I will cause thee to dwell as was thy desire of old and will do better [unto you] than at your beginnings; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will cause men to walk upon you, [even] my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and from now on thou shalt no longer bereave them [of sons].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because they say of you, Thou [land that] devours up men and hast bereaved thy nations of sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations of sons any more, saith the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither will I cause [men] to hear in thee the shame of the Gentiles any longer, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause the sons of thy inhabitants to die any longer, saith the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, the house of Israel which dwells in their land has defiled it with their own ways and with their works; their way was before me as the uncleanness of a menstruous woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols [with which] they had polluted it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I scattered them among the Gentiles, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their ways and according to their doings I judged them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they entered unto the Gentiles, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These [are] the people of the LORD and are gone forth out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it has pained me to see my holy name profaned by the house of Israel among the Gentiles where they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I do not [do this] for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the Gentiles, where ye went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the Gentiles, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the Gentiles shall know that I [am] the LORD, said the Lord GOD when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will take you from among the Gentiles and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my commandments, and ye shall keep my rights, and do [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will also keep you from all your uncleanness: and I will call to the wheat and will multiply it and lay no famine upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will multiply likewise the fruit of the trees, and the fruit of the fields, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then ye shall remember your own evil ways and your doings that [were] not good and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Not for your sakes do I [do this], said the Lord GOD, be it known unto you; be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities. I will also cause [you] to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>who said, This desolate land used to be like the garden of Eden; and these waste and desolate and ruined cities used to be fortified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Gentiles that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD built the ruined [places and] planted that which was desolate; I the LORD have spoken [it], and I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus hath the Lord GOD said; I will yet be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do [it] for them; I will multiply men like flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As the holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
