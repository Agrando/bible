I will cast thee forth upon the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will also water with thy blood the land in which thou dost swim, [even] to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when thou art dead, I will cover the heavens and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the bright lights of heaven I will make dark because of thee and set darkness upon thy land, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will also make the hearts of many peoples sad when I shall bring thy destruction upon the Gentiles, into the countries which thou hast not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will make many peoples amazed at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid because of thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at [every] moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thus hath the Lord GOD said: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>By the swords of the mighty I will cause thy people to fall; they [shall] all be the strong of the Gentiles and they shall destroy the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will also destroy all the beasts thereof from upon the many waters; neither shall the foot of man, nor the hoofs of beasts foul them any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I will make their waters deepen and cause their channels to run like oil, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and the fullness of the land shall be taken away when I shall smite all those that dwell therein, then they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This [is] the lamentation, and they shall sing it; the daughters of the Gentiles shall sing it: they shall lament over Egypt and over all her multitude, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It also came to pass in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day] of the month, [that] the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, lament over the multitude of Egypt and cast him down and the habitations of the strong Gentiles into the lower parts of the earth with those that go down into the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because thou art so beautiful, go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They shall fall in the midst of [those that are] slain by the sword; he is delivered to the sword; bring him and all his peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those that help him: they are gone down; they lie with the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Asshur [is] there and all his company; his graves [are] about him; all of them slain, fallen by the sword:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and his company is round about his grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There [is] Elam and all his multitude round about his grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the lowest [parts] of the earth because they spread their terror in the land of the living; yet they have borne their shame with those that go down to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They have set him a bed in the midst of the slain with all his multitude: his graves [are] round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword because they spread their terror in the land of the living, yet they have borne their shame with those that go down to the pit; [he] was put in the midst of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There [is] Meshech, Tubal, and all his multitude; his graves [are] round about him, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword because they had caused their terror in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they shall not lie with the mighty [that are] fallen of the uncircumcised, who are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their sins shall be upon their bones because [they were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[Yea], thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shalt lie with [those that are] slain with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There [is] Edom, his kings, and all his princes, which with their might are laid with [those that were] slain by the sword; they shall lie with the uncircumcised and with those that go down to the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There [are] the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, who are gone down with the slain with their terror, ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with [those that are] slain by the sword and bear their shame with those that go down to the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude, [even] Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Because I have spread my terror in the land of the living, he shall also lay in the midst of the uncircumcised with [those that are] slain with the sword, [even] Pharaoh and all his multitude, said the Lord GOD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
