and the day of the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the same manner it shall be opened the day of the new moon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the prince shall enter from outside by the way of the porch of [that] gate and shall stand by the threshold of the gate (while the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings), and he shall worship at the entrance of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the day of the sabbath [shall be] six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the present [shall be] an ephah [of fine flour] for each ram and the present for each lamb as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil for each ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But in the day of the new moon [it shall be] a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he shall prepare a present of an ephah [of fine flour] with the calf, and [another] ephah with each ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and a hin of oil with each ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of [that] gate, and he shall go forth by the [same] way thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that enters in by the way of the north gate [to worship] shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that enters by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate; he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go forth opposite it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the prince, when they go in, he shall go in, in the midst of them; and when they go forth, he shall go forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in the feasts and in the solemnities the present shall be an ephah [of fine flour] with each calf, and another ephah with [each] ram, and with the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil with [each] ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, they shall open him the gate that looks toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he does on the day of the Sabbath; then he shall go forth; and after his going forth they shall shut the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD [of] a lamb of the first year without blemish; thou shalt prepare it each morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shalt prepare a present with it each morning, the sixth part of an ephah [of fine flour], and the third part of a hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; [this shall be] a present for the LORD continually by [a] perpetual ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus shall they prepare the lamb and the present and the oil each morning [for] a continual burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: If the prince gives a gift of his inheritance unto any of his sons, it [shall be] theirs; the possession thereof [shall be] by inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his until the year of liberty; when it shall return to the prince; but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the prince shall take nothing from the people's inheritance, that he not defraud them of their possession; [but] he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession that my people not be scattered each one from his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After he brought me through the entry, which [was] at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north; and, behold, there [was] a place on the two sides westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he said unto me, This [is] the place where the priests shall boil that [which was offered as] guilt and that [which was offered as] sin, where they shall bake the present; that they not bear [them] out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in each corner of the court [there was] a patio.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the four corners of the court [there were] patios joined of forty [cubits] long and thirty broad; these four corners [were] of one measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And [there was] a wall round about in them, round about those four, and [it was] made with fire places all around the palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said he unto me, These [are] the quarters of the cooks, where the servers of the house shall cook the sacrifice of the people.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
