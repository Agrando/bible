[Is this] of thy whoredoms a small matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that thou hast sacrificed my children and given them over to them that they might cause them to pass through [the fire] unto them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms hast thou not remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and bare? Thou wast polluted in thy blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe unto thee! said the Lord GOD)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[that] thou hast also built unto thee a high place and hast made thee an altar in every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou hast built thy altar at every head of every way and hast made thy beauty abominable and hast opened thy thighs to every one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou hast also committed fornication with the sons of Egypt, thy neighbours, great of flesh, and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished thy liberty and delivered thee unto the will of those that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou hast played the whore also with the sons of Assyria because thou wast insatiable; thou hast played the harlot with them and yet could not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thou hast likewise multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan and of the Chaldeans, and yet thou wast not satisfied with this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How inconsistent is thy heart, said the Lord GOD, having done all these [things], the work of a powerful harlot:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>building thine altars at the head of every way and making thine altars in every street! And thou hast not been as a harlot in that thou scornest hire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>[but as] a wife that commits adultery, [who] takes strangers instead of her husband!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They give gifts to all whores, but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers and givest them offerings that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And in thee it is to the contrary from [other] women in thy whoredoms; and after thee, there shall never be [whoredom like unto thine] because in giving thy gifts when gifts are not given unto thee, it has been backwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because thy nakedness has been uncovered, and thy confusion has been manifested to thy lovers in thy whoredoms and to the idols of thy abominations and in the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>therefore, behold that I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all [those] that thou hast loved, with all [those] that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And [I]will judge thee by the laws regarding women who commit adultery and those that shed blood; and I will give thee [away] in blood of fury and of jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will deliver thee into their hand, and they shall destroy thy high [place] and shall break down thy altars; they shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take the vessels of thy glory and shall leave thee naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they shall burn thine houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet and will no longer be angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast provoked me to anger in all this; therefore, behold I also have recompensed thy way upon [thine] head, said the Lord GOD; for thou hast not even thought regarding all thine abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, every one that makes proverbs shall make [this] proverb regarding thee, saying: As [is] the mother [so is] her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou [art] thy mother's daughter that discarded her husband and her children; and thou [art] the sister of thy sisters who discarded their husbands and their children: your mother [was] a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And thine elder sister [is] Samaria with her daughters that dwell at thy left hand; and thy younger sister that dwells at thy right hand [is] Sodom with her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet thou hast not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as [if that were] a very little [thing], thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>[As] I live, said the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister has never done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the afflicted and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they filled themselves with arrogance and committed abomination before me, and when I saw it, I took them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Neither has Samaria committed half of thy sins, but thou hast multiplied thy abominations more than they and hast justified thy sisters with all thy abominations which thou hast done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Thou also, who hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they; they are more righteous than thou; be thou confounded also and bear thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I shall turn their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then [I will release] the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>that thou may bear thine own shame and may be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their first state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their first state, thou and thy daughters shall return to your first state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Sodom, thy sister was not mentioned by thy mouth in the time of thy pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>before thy wickedness discovered itself, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and of all the daughters of the Philistines round about, who despise thee in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For thus hath the Lord GOD said: Will I deal with thee even as thou hast done, despising the oath to invalidate the covenant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant that I made with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will confirm unto thee an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And I will confirm my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>that thou may remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, said the Lord GOD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
