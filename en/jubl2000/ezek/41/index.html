and he measured its length, forty cubits; and its breadth, twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then he went inward and measured [each] post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple; and he said unto me, This [is] the most holy [place].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of the chambers, four cubits, round about the house on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the chambers [were] one over another, and thirty-three by order; and they entered [supports] into the wall of the house round about, upon which the chambers might have hold, but they did not have hold upon the wall of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And [there was] an enlarging and a winding about in the chambers to the highest [part]; for the winding about of the house [went] very high round about [inside] the house; therefore the house [had greater] breadth upward, and from the lowest chamber it rose to the highest by the one in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I saw also the height of the house round about; the foundations of the chambers [were] a full reed of six great cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The thickness of the outside wall of the chambers [was] five cubits; and the space that was left of the chambers that [were] within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And between the chambers [was] the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the door of each chamber [was] toward the space that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the space that was left [was] five cubits round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the building that [was] before the separate place to the side toward the west [was] seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building [was] five cubits thick round about, and its length ninety cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the south, one hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which [was] behind it, and its chambers on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the portals of the court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The thresholds, and the narrow windows, and the chambers, three around about to the front, all covered with wood round about from the ground up to the windows, and the windows [were also] covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Above over the door, and unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, he took measurements.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And [the wall] was decorated with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree [was] between a cherub and a cherub; and [each] cherub had two faces;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>so that the face of a man [was] toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other side, through all the house round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From the ground unto above the door cherubim and palm trees [were] made, and [upon] the entire wall of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Each post of the temple [was] squared, [and] the front of the sanctuary was as the other front.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The altar of wood [was] three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and the surface thereof, and its walls, [were] of wood; and he said unto me, This is the table that [is] before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves; two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other [door].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And [there were] made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as [were] made upon the walls; and [there were] thick planks upon the face of the porch without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And [there were] narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and of the house, and upon the beams.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
