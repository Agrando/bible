but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus hath the Lord GOD said: An evil, behold, an evil is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end is come, the end is come; it watches for thee; behold, it is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The morning comes for thee, O thou that dwellest in the land; the time comes, the day of is near, the day of trouble, and it shall not be the echo of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I will shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish my anger in thee; and I will judge thee according to thy ways and place all thine abominations upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And my eye shall not forgive, neither will I have mercy; I will recompense thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD that smites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold the day, behold, it comes; the morning is gone forth; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; nothing [shall remain] of them, nor of their riches, nor of anything of theirs; neither [shall there be] lamentation for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time is come, the day draws near; do not let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath [is] upon all the multitude thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they remain alive, for the vision [is] touching the whole multitude thereof and shall not be cancelled; neither shall any in the iniquity of his life strengthen himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They shall blow the trumpet and make everything ready, but there [shall be] no one to go forth to the battle, for my wrath [is] upon all the multitude thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword [is] without, and the pestilence and the famine within; he that [is] in the field shall die with the sword, and he that [is] in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those that escape of them shall be upon the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each one for his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak [as] water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall also gird [themselves] with sackcloth, and trembling shall cover them; and shame [shall be] upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold far from [them] their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels because it shall be the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because they turned the glory of his ornament into pride and made in her the images of their abominations of their statues; therefore I have set it far from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also turn my face from them, and they shall pollute my secret [place], for the destroyers shall enter into it and defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make [a] chain, for the land is full of bloody judgments, and the city is full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I will bring the worst of all the Gentiles, and they shall possess their houses; I will also cause the arrogance of the strong to cease; and their sanctuaries shall be defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>A cutting off comes, and they shall seek peace, and [there shall be] none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Destruction shall come upon destruction, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then they shall seek an answer from the prophet, but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their judgments I will judge them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
