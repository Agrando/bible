What shall be if it does not despise the rod? said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy and smite [thine] hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain; this is the sword of great slaughter that shall pierce them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have set the fear of the sword in all their gates, that [their] heart may faint and [their] ruins be multiplied; ah! [it is] made so that it might shine; [it is] prepared for the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go one way or other, [either] on the right hand [or] on the left, wherever thy face [is] set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest; I the LORD have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also, thou son of man, show two ways from where the sword of the king of Babylon comes: both shall come forth out of the same land and draw an army; at the head of the way to the city thou shalt do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Show the way that the sword will come to Rabbath of the Ammonites and to Judah against Jerusalem, the defenced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination; he made [his] arrows bright; he consulted with images; he looked in the liver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The divination was to his right hand upon Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth for the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint [battering] rams against the gates, to cast a mount, [and] to build a fort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to those that have sworn oaths; but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, manifesting your betrayals and uncovering your sins in all your doings; for which ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come in the time when the iniquity shall be brought to an end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>thus hath the Lord GOD said: Remove the diadem and take off the crown; it shall no longer be like this; I will exalt the one that is low and abase the one that is high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it, and it shall be no [more] until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it [unto him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword [is] drawn for the slaughter; [it is] furbished to consume with brightness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They prophesy vanity unto thee; they divine a lie unto thee, to give thee over among the necks of the wicked who are sentenced to death, whose day is come in the time when the iniquity shall be brought to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Shall I cause [it] to return into its sheath? I must judge thee in the place where thou wast raised, in the land of where thou hast lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will pour out my indignation upon thee; I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand of fearful men [who are] skilful to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt no [longer] be remembered: for I the LORD have spoken.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
