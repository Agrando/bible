But David abode in the wilderness, and he perceived that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David, therefore, sent out spies and understood that Saul was indeed come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David arose and came to the place where Saul had pitched camp, and David beheld the place where Saul lay and Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his host. And Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then David spoke and said to Ahimelech, the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his head, but Abner and the people lay round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Abishai said to David, God has delivered thy enemy into thy hand today; now, therefore, let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear [and pin him] to the earth at once, and I will not [need] a second opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Abishai, Do not destroy him, for who has stretched forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and remained innocent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>David said furthermore, [As] the LORD lives, if the LORD does not smite him or his day comes to die or he descends into battle and perishes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed; but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that [is] at his head and the cruse of water and let us go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So David took the spear and the cruse of water that were at Saul's head, and they went, and no one saw [it] nor knew [it] neither awaked, for they [were] all asleep because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then David went over to the other side and stood out of the way on the top of the mountain, a great space [being] between them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and David cried to the people and to Abner, the son of Ner, saying, Dost thou not answer, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who [art] thou [that] dost cry to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said to Abner, [Art] not thou a man? And who [is there] like unto thee in Israel? Why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This thing [is] not good that thou hast done. [As] the LORD lives, ye [are] worthy to die because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear [is] and the cruse of water that [was] at his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul knew David's voice and said, [Is] this thy voice, my son David? And David said, [It is] my voice, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD has stirred thee up against me, let him smell [the fragrance of] an offering, but if [they were] the sons of men, [let] them [be] cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day from joining myself to the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now therefore, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD, for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Saul said, I have sinned; return, my son David; for I will do no more harm unto thee because my life was precious in thine eyes today. Behold, I have played the fool and have erred exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! Let one of the servants come over and take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The LORD render to each one his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the LORD delivered thee into [my] hand today, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, behold, as thy life has been esteemed today in my eyes, so let my life be esteemed in the eyes of the LORD and let him deliver me out of all affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Saul said to David, Blessed [art] thou, my son David; without a doubt thou shalt do great [things] and prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
