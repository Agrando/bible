[Am] I not a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? Choose a man from among you, and let him come down to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If he is able to fight with me and to overcome me, then will we be your servants, but if I prevail against him and overcome him, then ye shall be our servants and serve us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Philistine said, I have dishonoured the ranks of Israel today; give me a man that we may fight together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David [was] the son of an Ephrathite man of Bethlehem of Judah, whose name [was] Jesse, and he had eight sons, and this man was old in the days of Saul and of advanced age among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone [and] followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons that went to the battle [were] Eliab, the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab and the third Shammah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David [was] the youngest, the three eldest having gone after Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But David had gone and returned from [being] with Saul to feed his father's sheep in Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself for forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched [grain] and these ten loaves and run to the camp to thy brethren</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of [their] thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel [were] in the valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went with his burden as Jesse had commanded him, and he came to the trench as the host was going forth in battle array, and they had already sounded the alarm for the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Israel and the Philistines had ordered the battle, army against army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and asked about his brethren, if they were well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as he talked with them, behold, there came up that man, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, speaking the same words, and David heard [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him and feared greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And each one of the men of Israel were saying, Have ye seen this man that is come up? He is come up to dishonour Israel. It shall be [that] the king will enrich the man who overcomes him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that overcomes this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who [is] this uncircumcised Philistine that he should dishonour the armies of the living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that overcomes him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Eliab, his eldest brother, heard when he spoke unto the men, and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why didst thou come down here? And with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the malice of thy heart, for thou art come down that thou might see the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And David said, What have I now done? [Is there] not a cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he turned from him toward another and spoke after the same manner, and the people answered him again after the former manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the words which David had spoken were heard, and they were rehearsed before Saul, and he sent for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for thou [art but] a young man, and he a man of war from his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And David replied unto Saul, Thy servant was the pastor of his father's sheep, and [if] a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I went out after him and smote him and delivered [it] out of his mouth; and if he arose against me, I caught [him] by his beard and smote him and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Whether it was a lion or a bear thy servant would kill it, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has dishonoured the armies of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul clothed David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head; he also armed him with a coat of mail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And David girded [Saul's] sword upon [Saul's] clothing, and he undertook to go, for he had not proved [them]. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not proved [them]. And putting them off, David</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a provision bag, and with his sling in his hand he drew near to the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David, and the man that bore the shield [went] before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him, for he was [but] a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the Philistine said unto David, [Am] I a dog that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then David said to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield, but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of the hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast dishonoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This day the LORD will deliver thee into my hand, and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee, and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the heaven and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all this congregation shall know that the LORD does not save with sword and spear, for the battle [is] the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David that David hastened and ran to do battle against the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And David put his hand in his bag and took a stone from there and slang [it] and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone remained sunk into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So David overcame the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philistine and slew him, but [there was] no sword in the hand of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and slew him and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw their giant was dead, they fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines unto the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath and unto Ekron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the sons of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son [is] this youth? And Abner said, [As] thy soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And the king said, Enquire whose son the young man is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Saul said to him, Whose son [art] thou, young man? And David answered, I [am] the son of thy servant Jesse of Bethlehem.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
