So the Kenite departed from among those of Amalek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah [until] thou comest to Shur that [is] over against Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag, the king of the Amalekites, alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all [that was] good and would not utterly destroy them, but every thing [that was] vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the word of the LORD came unto Samuel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It grieves me that I have set up Saul [to be] king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments. And it incensed Samuel, and he cried unto the LORD all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set himself up a monument and is gone about and passed on and gone down to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said unto him, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD; I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Samuel said, What [means] then this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said, They have brought them from Amalek, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, When thou [wast] little in thine own sight, [wast] thou not [made] the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD sent thee on a journey and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners of Amalek and fight against them until they are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then didst thou not hear the voice of the LORD but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said unto Samuel, But I have obeyed the voice of the LORD and have gone the way which the LORD sent me and have brought Agag, the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the firstfruits of the anathema, to sacrifice them unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said, Does the LORD have [as great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in hearing the voice of the LORD? Behold, to hear [is] better than sacrifice [and] to hearken than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion [is] the sin of witchcraft, and to break [the word of the Lord is] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected thee from [being] king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and thy words because I feared the people and consented unto their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may worship the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee, for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected thee from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said unto him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee today and has given it to a neighbour of thine [that is] better than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Overcomer of Israel will not lie nor repent concerning this, for he [is] not a man, that he should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, I have sinned; [yet] honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people and before Israel and turn again with me that I may worship the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned again after Saul, and Saul worshipped the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Samuel said, Bring me Agag, the king of Amalek. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. Then Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; nevertheless, Samuel mourned for Saul because the LORD had repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
