Then David departed and came into the forest of Hareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Saul heard how David had appeared and the men that [were] with him (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants [were] standing about him),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye sons of Jemini, will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards [and] make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>that all of you have conspired against me, and [there is] no one that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and [there is] none of you that is sorry for me or shows unto me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait [against] me, as at this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Doeg, the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, answered and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he enquired of the LORD for him and gave him provision and gave him the sword of Goliath, the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech, the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that [were] in Nob; and they all came to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I [am], my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of God for him that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, the king's son-in-law, who goes at thy bidding and is honourable in thy house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Did I begin to enquire of God for him today? Be it far from me; let not the king impute [any] thing unto his servant [nor] to all the house of my father, for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou and all thy father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn and slay the priests of the LORD because their hand also [is] with David and because they knew when he fled and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to fall upon the priests of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king said to Doeg, Turn thou and fall upon the priests. And Doeg, the Edomite, turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day eighty-five men that wore a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abiathar gave David the news that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said unto Abiathar, I knew [it] that day when Doeg, the Edomite, [was] there that he would surely tell Saul. I have given cause [before Saul] against all the persons of thy father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Abide thou with me; do not fear, for he that seeks my life seeks thy life; [it is good] that thou shalt be kept with me.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
