Give [me] five [loaves of] bread in my hand or what there is present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the priest answered David and said, [There is] no common bread under my hand; there is only sacred bread, which I will give thee if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David answered the priest and said unto him, Of a truth women [have been] kept from us since yesterday and the day before yesterday since I came out, and the vessels of the young men were holy although the way is profane; how much more that today it shall be sanctified with the vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the priest gave him the sacred bread, for there was no bread there but the showbread that had been taken from before the LORD to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul [was] there that day, fulfilling [a vow] before the LORD, and his name [was] Doeg, an Edomite, the principal of the pastors of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand a spear or a sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's business required haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the priest replied, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou didst overcome in the valley of Elah, behold, it [is here] wrapped in a veil behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take [it], for [there is] none other except that here. And David said, [There is] none like that; give it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David arose and fled that day from the presence of Saul and went to Achish, the king of Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the servants of Achish said unto him, [Is] this not David, the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of Achish, the king of Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself a fool in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Achish said unto his servants, Behold, ye see the man is mad; why [then] have ye brought him to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Have I need of mad men that ye have brought this [fellow] to play the mad man in my presence? Shall this [fellow] come into my house?:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
