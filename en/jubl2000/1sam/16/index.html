Fill thy horn with oil and go; I will send thee to Jesse of Bethlehem for I have provided me a king among his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul understands [it], he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take a heifer with thee and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do, and thou shalt anoint unto me the one whom I name unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samuel did as the LORD said and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said, Comest thou peaceably?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab and said, Peradventure is the LORD'S anointed before him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD replied unto Samuel, Do not look on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him, for it is not as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Again, Jesse made his seven sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD has not chosen these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are all [thy] young men here? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send for him, for we will not sit down to the table until he comes here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sent and brought him in. Now he [was] ruddy [and] of a beautiful countenance and handsome. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him, for this [is] he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him from among his brethren; and the Spirit of the LORD prospered David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let our lord now command thy servants, [which are] before thee, to seek out a man [who is] a cunning player on a harp, and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt have relief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well and bring [him] to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then one of the servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem, [that is] cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in speech and handsome, and the LORD [is] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse and said, Send me David, thy son, who [is] with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesse took an ass [laden] with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent [them] by David, his son, unto Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to Saul and stood before him; and he loved him greatly, and he became his armourbearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he has found favour in my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was better, and the evil spirit departed from him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
