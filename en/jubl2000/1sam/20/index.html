What [is] my iniquity or what [is] my sin before thy father that he seeks my life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said unto him, No, in no wise; thou shalt not die. Behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me, and why should my father hide this thing from me? It [shall] not [be] so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knows that I have found grace in thine eyes, and he [saith in himself], Let Jonathan not know this lest he be grieved; but truly [as] the LORD lives and [as] thy soul lives, [there is] but a step between me and death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jonathan said unto David, Whatever thy soul saith, I will do [it] for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David replied unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow [is] the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at food, but thou shalt let me go and hide myself in the field until the evening of the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If thy father at all misses me, then say, David earnestly asked [leave] of me that he might run to Bethlehem, his city, for all those of his lineage have an anniversary sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If he should say, [It is] well; thy servant shall have peace; but if he is very wroth, [then] be sure that the evil is determined in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, thou shalt deal in mercy with thy servant, for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee; notwithstanding, if there is iniquity in me, slay me thyself, for why should thou bring me to thy father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee, for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would I not be obliged to show it to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? Or what [if] thy father answers thee roughly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And both of them went out into the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I shall have asked my father tomorrow at this time or after tomorrow and, behold, [if there is] good toward David and I then do not send unto thee and show it to thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the LORD do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it pleases my father [to do] thee evil, then I will show it to thee and send thee away that thou may go in peace; and the LORD be with thee as he has been with my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if I live, thou shalt show me the mercy of the LORD, but if I am dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>thou shalt not cut off thy mercy from my house for ever. When the LORD has cut off one by one the enemies of David from the face of the earth, remove [even] Jonathan from thy house [if I fail thee] and require it at the hand of David's enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jonathan made [a covenant] with the house of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jonathan swore unto David again because he loved him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow [is] the new moon, and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And [when] thou hast stayed three days, [then] thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the work and shalt remain by the stone Ezel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and I will shoot three arrows on the side [thereof] as though I shot at a mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, behold, I will send a lad, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows [are] on this side of thee; take them, then come thou, for [there is] peace unto thee and no hurt, [as] the LORD lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond thee, then go away, for the LORD has sent thee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And [as touching] the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, let the LORD [be] between thee and me for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So David hid himself in the field, and when the new moon was come, the king sat down to eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king sat upon his seat as at other times, [even] upon a seat by the wall; and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless, Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he [is] not clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the next day, [which was] the second [day] of the new moon, that David's place was empty, and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Why did not the son of Jesse come to food, neither yesterday nor today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked [leave] of me [to go] to Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for those of our lineage have a sacrifice in the city, and my brother, he has commanded me [to be there], and now, if I have found grace in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he has not come unto the king's table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious [woman], do I not know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother's shame?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the land, thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom. Therefore, now send and bring him unto me, for he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said unto him, Why shall he be slain? What has he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul cast a spear at him to smite him whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved for David [and] because his father had done him shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said unto his lad, Run and find the arrows which I shoot. [And] as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, [Is] not the arrow beyond thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the lad did not understand anything; only Jonathan and David understood the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad and said unto him, Go, carry [them] to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>[And] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the Negev and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times, and they kissed one another and wept one with another, although David exceeded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed, and Jonathan entered into the city.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
