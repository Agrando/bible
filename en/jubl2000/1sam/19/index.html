Thou didst see [it] and rejoice. Why then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay David without a cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, [As] the LORD lives, he shall not be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was war again, and David went out and fought with the Philistines and slew them with a great slaughter, and they fled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand, and David played with [his] hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul sought to smite David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, who smote the spear into the wall; and David fled and escaped that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saul also sent messengers unto David's house to watch him and to slay him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life tonight tomorrow thou shalt be dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Michal let David down through a window, and he went and fled and escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Michal took an image and laid [it] in the bed and put a pillow of goats' [hair] at his head and covered [it] with a cloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He [is] sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul sent the messengers [again] to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed that I may slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the messengers were come in, behold, [there was] an image in the bed with a pillow of goats' [hair] at his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so and sent away my enemy that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; if not, I shall kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So David fled and escaped and came to Samuel in Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David [is] at Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing [as] appointed over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he also went to Ramah and came to a great well that [is] in Sechu, and he asked and said, Where [are] Samuel and David? And [one] said, Behold, [they are] at Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went there to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before Samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night. From here it was said, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
