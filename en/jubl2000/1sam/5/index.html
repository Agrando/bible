And he smote the men of that city from the smallest to the greatest, and they broke out with hemorrhoids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have removed the ark of the God of Israel unto us to kill me and my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So they sent and gathered together all the cardinals of the Philistines and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it not kill me and my people, for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city, and the hand of God had become very heavy there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And those that did not die were smitten with the hemorrhoids, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
