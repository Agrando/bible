For the pillars of the earth [are] the LORD'S, and he has set the world upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He keeps the feet of his saints, and the wicked perish in darkness, for no man shall prevail by [their own] strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>LORD, thine adversaries shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven he shall thunder upon them. The LORD shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial; they did not know the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>[It was] the priests' custom with the people [that] when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the flesh was being boiled, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he would strike [it] into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took for himself. Thus would they do in Shiloh to all the Israelites that went there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Likewise, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant would come and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not take cooked flesh of thee, but raw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And [if] the man would say unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat today and [then] take [as much] as thy soul desires, then he would answer him, No, but thou shalt give [it to me] now, and if not, I will take [it] by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for men despised the present of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, [being] a child, girded with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought [it] to him each year when she came up with her husband to offer the accustomed sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD visited Hannah so that she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel and how they lay with the women that served [at] the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto them, Why do ye [do] such things? For I hear from all the people of your evil dealings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No, my sons, for [it is] no good report that I hear that ye cause the people of the LORD to transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one man sins against another, the judges shall judge him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they did not hearken unto the voice of their father because the LORD had [already] decided to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the child Samuel kept on growing and was in favour both with the LORD and also with men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a man of God came unto Eli and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I not plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharaoh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel [to be] my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me, and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings on fire of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why do ye trample my sacrifices and my offerings which I have commanded [to be offered] in my tabernacle and honor thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, the LORD God of Israel said, I had said indeed [that] thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever, but now the LORD said, It shall never be; for those that honor me I will honor, and those that lightly esteem me shall be vile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days come that I will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father's house that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And thou shalt see a competitor [in my] tabernacle in all the things in which I shall do good unto Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I shall not [totally] cut off [all] thy men from my altar to consume thine eyes and to grieve thy soul, and all the increase of thy house shall die as [young] men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this [shall be] a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will raise me up a faithful priest [that] shall do according to [that] which [is] in my heart and in my mind, and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it shall come to pass [that] every one that is left in thy house shall come [and] crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into some aspect of the priesthood that I may eat a piece of bread.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
