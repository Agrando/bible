Among the sons of Israel there was not a nicer person than he; from his shoulders and upward [he was] higher than any of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the [she] asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul, his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he passed through Mount Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find [them]. Then they passed through the land of Shalim, and [they were] not [there], and he passed through the land of Jemini, but they did not find [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[And] when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that [was] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave [caring] for the asses and take thought for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto him, Behold now, [there is] in this city a man of God, and [he is] an honorable man; all that he says surely comes to pass; now let us go there; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul replied unto his servant, But, behold, [if] we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and we have nothing to present unto the man of God. What do we have?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the servant answered Saul again and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver; this will I give to the man of God to tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(Beforetime in Israel when anyone went to enquire of God, he spoke thus, Come, and let us go to the seer, for [he that is] now [called] a Prophet was called a Seer before.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Saul said to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God [was].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[And] as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them, Is the seer here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they answered them and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you; make haste now, for he came today to the city, for [there is] a sacrifice of the people today in the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As soon as you are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes because he must bless the sacrifice, [and] afterwards those that are invited eat. Now therefore go up, for about this time ye shall find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they went up into the city. [And] when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out before them to go up to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him [to be] prince over my people Israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spoke to thee of! This same shall reign over my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house [is].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul and said, I [am] the seer; go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I will let thee go and will tell thee all that [is] in thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, take no care for them, for they are found. And on whom [is] all the desire of Israel? [Is it] not on thee and on all thy father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul answered and said, Peradventure am I not of Jemini, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And is my family not the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why, therefore, dost thou speak so to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the [banquet] chamber and made them sit at the head among those that were invited, which [were] about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it aside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the shoulder and [that] which [was] upon it and set [it] before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Behold that which was reserved! Set [it] before thee [and] eat because for this time it has been kept for thee, since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul upon the top of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arose early about dawn, and Samuel called Saul, who was on the top of the house, saying, Rise up that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>[And] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while that I may declare thee the word of God.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
