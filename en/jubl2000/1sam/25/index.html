And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And [there was] a man in Maon whose possessions [were] in Carmel, and the man [was] very great, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the name of the man [was] Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. And [she was] a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance, but the man [was] hard and evil in his doings, and he was [of the lineage] of Caleb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Climb up to Carmel and go to Nabal and greet him in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thus shall ye say to him, May thou live and peace [be] unto thee and peace [be] unto thy house and peace [be] unto all that thou hast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have recently heard that thou hast shearers. Now thy shepherds who were with us, we did not hurt them, neither was there anything missing unto them all the while they were in Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Therefore, let the young men find grace in thine eyes, for we come in a good day; give, I pray thee, whatever is in thy hand unto thy servants and to thy son David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David and ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Nabal answered David's servants and said, Who [is] David? And who [is] the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays that break from their masters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Shall I then take my bread and my water and my slaughtered [meat] that I have killed for my shearers and give [it] unto men that I do not know where they are from?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So David's young men left and returned and came and told him all those words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then David said unto his men, Gird ye on each man his sword. And each one girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword; and about four hundred men went up after David, and they left two hundred with the stuff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And one of the servants told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master, and he railed on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the men [were] very good unto us and never hurt us, neither did we miss anything all the time that we have been conversant with them when we were in the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They were a wall unto us both by night and day all the time that we were feeding the sheep with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, therefore, know and consider what thou must do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his household, for he [is such] a son of Belial that no one can speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched [flour] and one hundred bunches of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid [them] on asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told nothing to her husband Nabal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it was [so] as she rode on the ass that she came down a secret part of the mountain, and, behold, David and his men came down against her, and she met them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this [fellow] has in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that [pertained] unto him, and he has returned unto me evil for good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let God do so and more also unto the enemies of David if I leave of all that [pertain] to him by the morning light any that piss against the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Abigail saw David, she hastened and lighted off the ass and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and fell at his feet and said, Upon me, my lord, [upon] me [let this] iniquity [be], and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thy audience; and hear the words of thy handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let not my lord, I pray thee, take to heart this man of Belial, [even] Nabal, for as his name [is], so [is] he; Nabal is his name, and folly [is] with him; but I, thy handmaid, did not see the servants of my lord whom thou didst send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now, therefore, my lord, [as] the LORD lives and [as] thy soul lives, seeing the LORD has withheld thee from coming to [shed] blood and from avenging thyself with thy own hand, now let thy enemies and those that seek evil to my lord be as Nabal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And now this blessing which thy handmaid has brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the servants that follow my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thy handmaid, for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil has not been found in thee [all] thy days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul, but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God, and he shall hurl forth the souls of thine enemies [as out] of the middle of a sling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it shall come to pass when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that this shall be no stumblingblock unto thee nor grief of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord has avenged himself; but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then David said to Abigail, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel who sent thee this day to meet me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and blessed [be] thy advice, and blessed [be] thou who hast kept me this day from coming to [shed] blood and from avenging myself with my own hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For in very deed [as] the LORD God of Israel lives, who has kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hastened and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that piss against the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So David received of her hand [that] which she had brought him and said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Abigail came to Nabal, and, behold, he held a banquet in his house like the banquet of a king; and Nabal's heart [was] merry within him, for he [was] very drunken; therefore, she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became [as] a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it came to pass about ten days [after], that the LORD smote Nabal, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed [be] the LORD that judged the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has kept his servant from evil, for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent word unto Abigail to take her to him to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke with her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And she arose and bowed herself on [her] face to the earth and said, Behold, [let] thy handmaid [be] a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Abigail hastened and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her, and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they were also both of them his wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Saul had given Michal, his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti, the son of Laish, who [was] of Gallim.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
