And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, [were] there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the day would come, Elkanah would sacrifice, and he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But unto Hannah he would give a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah, even though the LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her rival provoked her to anger and sorrow because the LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this would happen year by year when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she would provoke her; therefore, she would weep and not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Elkanah, her husband, said to her, Hannah, why dost thou weep? And why dost thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? [Am] I not better to thee than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she [was] in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the LORD and wept sore;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and she vowed a vow and said, O LORD of the hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass as she continued praying before the LORD that Eli was observing her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah spoke in her heart and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore, Eli thought she was drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I [am] a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not count thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have waited until now to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant [thee] thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no longer [sad].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the LORD and returned and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, she bore a son and called his name Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the LORD the accustomed sacrifice and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah did not go up, for she said unto her husband, [I will not go up] until the child is weaned, and [then] I will bring him that he may be presented before the LORD and abide there for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah, her husband, said unto her, Do what seems good unto thee; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only [let] the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the child [was] young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they slew a bullock and brought the child to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy soul lives, my lord, I [am] the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this child I prayed, and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, I also have given him back to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall belong to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
