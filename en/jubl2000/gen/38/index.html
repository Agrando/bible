And he was at Chezib, when she gave birth to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name [was] Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD and the LORD slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Onan knew that the seed would not be his, and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he corrupted [it] on the ground, to not give seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the thing which he did displeased the LORD, and he slew him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house until Shelah, my son, is grown; for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren [did]. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And many days passed and Judah's wife, the daughter of Shuah, died; and Judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father in law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she took off her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself and sat by the gate to the waters by the way to Timnath, for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Judah saw her, he thought her [to be] a harlot because she had covered her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he turned unto her by the way and said, Come now, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee (for he knew not that she [was] his daughter-in-law). And she said, What wilt thou give me that thou may come in unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I will send [thee] from the sheep a kid [from the goats]. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge until thou send [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy mantel and thy staff that [is] in thine hand. And he gave them [to] her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she arose and went away and took off her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive [his] pledge from the woman's hand; but he did not find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where [is] the cult prostitute of the waters by the way side? And they said, There was no cult prostitute in this [place].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he returned to Judah and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said [that] there was no cult prostitute in this [place].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah said, Let her take [the things] for herself lest we be shamed; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar, thy daughter-in-law, has played the harlot; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth and let her be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When she [was] brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these [are], [am] I with child; and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet and mantel and staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She has been more righteous than I because I did not give her to Shelah, my son. And he knew her again no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass in the time of her travail that, behold, twins [were] in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass when she travailed, that [the one] put out [his] hand, and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out; and she said, Why hast thou brought this breach upon thee? Therefore his name was called Pharez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And afterward his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand came out, and his name was called Zarah.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
