And they said, No, but we will abide in the street all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he pressed upon them greatly, and they turned in unto him and entered into his house, and he made them a banquet and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they called unto Lot and said unto him, Where [are] the men who came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us that we may know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you and do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes; only unto these men do nothing, for they have come under the shadow of my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said, Stand back. And they said [again], This fellow came in to sojourn and is he to lift himself up as judge? Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they did great violence to the man, [even] Lot, and came near to break the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the men put forth their hand and pulled Lot into the house with them and shut the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they smote the men that [were] at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou anyone else here? Sons-in-law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatever thou hast in the city, bring [them] out of this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxed great before the face of the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Lot went out and spoke unto his sons-in-law, those who were to marry his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters, the LORD being merciful unto him; and they brought him forth and set him outside the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass as they brought them forth outside, that he said, Escape; for thy soul, do not look behind thee, neither stop thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>behold now, thy servant has found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold now, this city [is] near to flee unto, and it [is] a little one; Oh, let me escape there, ([is] it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also that I will not overthrow the city for which thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Make thee haste, escape there; for I cannot do anything until thou hast arrived there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sun was rising upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he overthrew those cities and all that plain, with all the inhabitants of those cities, and the fruit of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the wife of Lot looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham rose up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of that plain and beheld that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass as God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the destruction when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man [left] in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him that we may preserve the generation of our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they made their father drink wine that night; and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And it came to pass on the next day that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in [and] lie with him that we may preserve the generation of our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; the same [is] the father of the Moabites unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Benammi; the same [is] the father of the sons of Ammon unto this day.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
