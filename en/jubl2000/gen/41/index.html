So Pharaoh awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he slept and dreamed the second time; and, behold, seven heads of wheat came up upon one stalk, full and beautiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, behold, seven thin heads, blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the seven thin heads devoured the seven full and beautiful heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dreams, but [there was] no one that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the chief butler spoke unto Pharaoh, saying, I remember my sins today;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in the prison of the captain of the guard's house, [both] me and the prince of the bakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And we both dreamed a dream in one night; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And [there was] there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams to us; he interpreted to each man according to his dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto my office, and him he hanged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and they cut his hair and changed his clothes, and he came in unto Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no one that can interpret it; but I have heard say of thee [that] thou canst hear dreams to interpret them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me; God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed and beautiful in appearance; and they fed in a meadow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, lean and very ugly in appearance, and thin, such as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I also saw in my dream, and, behold, seven heads came up in one stalk, full and beautiful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and, behold, seven heads, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads; and I told [this] unto the magicians, but [there was] no one that could declare [it] to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The seven beautiful cows [are] seven years; and the seven good heads [are] seven years; the dream [is] one and the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Also the seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty heads blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh. What God [is] about to do he has shown unto Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, seven years of great plenty are coming throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And that the dream came unto Pharaoh twice, [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore let Pharaoh find a discreet and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up wheat under the hand of Pharaoh to feed the cities, and let them store [it] up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And let that food be stored for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not perish through the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the Spirit of God [is]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God has showed thee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, Abrech [Tender Father-honour this one as a precious father]; and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee no one shall lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah, and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over [all] the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the cities, placing in each city the food of the field, which [was] round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Joseph gathered wheat as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left [off] numbering; for [it was] without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, prince of On, bore unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh; For God, [said he], has made me forget all my toil and all my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the name of the second he called Ephraim, For God, [said he], has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the seven years of the abundance that was in the land of Egypt were ended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said; and the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And the famine was over all the face of the earth. Then Joseph opened all [the storehouses] and sold unto the Egyptians; for the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And all the earth came into Egypt to buy from Joseph because the famine was so sore in all lands.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
