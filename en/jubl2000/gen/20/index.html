And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, Behold, thou [art] a dead man, for the woman whom thou hast taken, for she [is] a man's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Abimelech had not come near her, and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous person?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Did he not say unto me, She [is] my sister? And she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother; in the simplicity of my heart and cleanness of my hands I have done this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And God said unto him in a dream, Yes, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me; therefore I did not allow thee to touch her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore restore the man [his] wife, for he [is] a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou restore [her] not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that [are] thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears; and the men feared greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us and [in] what have I sinned against thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom such a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What didst thou see that thou hast done this thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God [is] not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And yet indeed, [she is also] my sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my father's house that I said unto her, This [is] the mercy which thou shalt show unto me: at every place where we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave [them] unto Abraham and restored him Sarah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Abimelech said, Behold, my land [is] before thee; dwell where it pleases thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver; behold, he [is] to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that [were] with thee and with everyone: thus she was reproved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants; and they bore [children].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the LORD had completely closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
