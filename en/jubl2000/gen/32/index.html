And where goest thou? And for whom [are] these before thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then thou shalt say, [They are] thy servant Jacob's; it [is] a present sent unto my lord Esau; and, behold, also he [is] behind us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed those droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau when ye find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And ye shall also say, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I will reconcile his wrath with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the present went over before him, and he lodged that night in the company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over [all] that he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when [the man] saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was disjointed as he wrestled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let thee go except thou bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said unto him, What [is] thy name? And he said, Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast fought with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob asked [him] and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Why dost thou ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for I have seen God face to face, and my soul was saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as he passed over Penuel, the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore the sons of Israel do not eat [of] the sinew which shrank, which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
