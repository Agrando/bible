Now arise, go out out from this land and return unto the land of thy nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, [Is there] yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Are we not counted of him strangers? For he has sold us and has even devoured all our price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all the riches which God has taken from our father, is ours and our son's; now then, whatever God has said unto thee, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he carried away all his livestock and all his goods which he had gotten, the livestock of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, to return unto Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the idols of her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob stole away the heart of Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up and passed the river and set his face [toward] mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God came to Laban the Aramean in dreams by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount; and Laban with his brethren pitched in mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away my heart and carried away my daughters as captives [taken] with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tambourine and with harp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Thou hast now done foolishly in [so] doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt, but the God of your father spoke unto me last night, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now, [that] thou art leaving, because thy desire is after thy father's house, [yet] why hast thou stolen my gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Peradventure thou would take by force thy daughters from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let them not live; before our brethren discern what [is] thine with me and take [it] to thee. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents, but he did not find [them]. Then he went out of Leah's tent and came to Rachel's tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now Rachel took the images and put them in a camel's saddle and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent but did not find [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women [is] upon me. And he searched, but did not find the images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jacob was wroth and contended with Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What [is] my trespass? What [is] my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set [it] here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge between us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>These twenty years I have been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not aborted their young, and I have not eaten the rams of thy flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>That which was torn [of beasts] I did not bring unto thee; I bore the sin; thou didst require of my hand that which was stolen, [whether] by day or by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>By day the drought consumed me, and by night, the frost; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, were not with me, surely thou would send me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the work of my hands and rebuked [thee] last night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, [These] daughters [are] my daughters, and [these] sons [are] my sons, and [these] sheep [are] my sheep, and all that thou seest [is] mine; and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their sons unto whom they have given birth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then Jacob took a stone and set it up [for] a pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones and made a heap; and they ate there upon the heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Laban said, This heap [is] a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take [other] wives beside my daughters, no man [is] with us; see, God [is] witness between me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold [this] pillar, which I have raised up between me and thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>[let] this heap [be] witness and [this] pillar [be] witness that I will not pass over this heap against thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar against me, for harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their fathers, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread; and they ate bread and slept in the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And early in the morning Laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them; and Laban departed and returned unto his place.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
