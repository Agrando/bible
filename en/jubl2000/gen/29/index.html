And they said, We [are] from Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto them, [Is] he well? And they said, [He is] well, and, behold, Rachel, his daughter, comes with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, behold, [it is] yet high day; neither [is it] time that the livestock should be gathered together; water the sheep and go [and] feed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and [until] they roll the stone from the well's mouth, that we may water the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was the pastor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban, his mother's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted up his voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he [was of] her father's brethren, and that he [was] Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him, Surely thou [art] my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou [art of] my brethren, should thou therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what [shall] thy wages [be]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder [was] Leah, and the name of the younger [was] Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Leah [was] tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob loved Rachel and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said, [It is] better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed unto him [but] a few days, for the love he had to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jacob said unto Laban, Give [me] my wife, for my days are fulfilled that I may go in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a banquet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the evening that he took Leah, his daughter, and brought her to him, and he went in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah, his maid, [for] a handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it [was] Leah; and he said to Laban, What [is] this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Why then hast thou beguiled me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfil her week, and we will give thee the other also for another seven years of service which thou shalt serve with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah and served with him yet another seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when the LORD saw that Leah [was] hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel [was] barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Surely the LORD has looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again and gave birth to a son; and said, Because the LORD has heard that I [was] hated, he has therefore given me this [son] also; and she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again and gave birth to a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have born him three sons; therefore his name was called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again and gave birth a son; and she said, Now I will praise the LORD; therefore she called his name Judah and stopped bearing [children].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
