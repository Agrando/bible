he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be free from this my oath; only do not bring my son there again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning that matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed with the best of what his master had in his hand; and he arose and went to Ara-naharaim, unto the city of Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, [even] the time that women go out to draw [water].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, O LORD, God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, to have a good encounter this day and show mercy unto my master Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, I stand [here] by the fountain of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come out for water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels to drink also; [let the same be] she [that] thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shown mercy unto my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass before he had done speaking that, behold, Rebekah came out (who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother) with her pitcher upon her shoulder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the damsel [was] very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known; and she went down to the fountain and filled her pitcher and and was coming [back] up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the servant ran to meet her and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Drink, my lord, and she hastened to let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, I will draw [water] for thy camels also until they have finished drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw [water] and drew for all his camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man marveled at her in silence, to see whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass as the camels had finished drinking that the man took a golden pendant of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten [shekels] weight of gold</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and said, Whose daughter [art] thou? Tell me, I pray thee; is there room [in] thy father's house for us to lodge in?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she said unto him, I [am] the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she gave birth unto Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and fodder enough and room to lodge in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the man bowed down his head and worshipped the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD, God of my master Abraham, who has not lifted his mercy and his truth from my master, the LORD leading me in the way to the house of my master's brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the damsel ran and told [those of] her mother's house these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Rebekah had a brother, and his name [was] Laban; and Laban ran out unto the man to the fountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass when he saw the pendant and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, she said, Thus spoke the man unto me; then he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the fountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why dost thou stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and the place for the camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the man came into the house, and [Laban] ungirded his camels and gave straw and fodder for the camels and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that [were] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they set [food] before him to eat, but he said, I will not eat until I have told my errand. And [he] said unto him, Speak on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I [am] Abraham's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD has blessed my master greatly, and he is become great; and he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old, unto whom he has given all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but thou shalt go unto my father's house and to my kindred and take from there a wife for my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my lineage and of my father's house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>then shalt thou be free from [this] my oath, when thou hast come unto my lineage; and if they give [her] not [unto] thee, thou shalt be free from my oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I came this day unto the fountain and said, O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way by which I go,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>behold, I stand by the fountain of water; let it come to pass, therefore, [that] the virgin who comes forth to draw [water] unto whom I say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and if she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels, [let] the same [be] the woman whom the LORD has prepared for my master's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder, and she went down unto the fountain and drew [water], and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And she made haste and let down her pitcher from her [shoulder] and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; so I drank, and she gave to drink unto the camels also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And I asked her and said, Whose daughter [art] thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore unto him. Then I put the pendant over her nose and the bracelets upon her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And I bowed down my head and worshipped the LORD and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of the truth to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And now if ye will deal in mercy and truth with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the LORD; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, Rebekah [is] before thee; take [her] and go and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And it came to pass that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, [bowing himself] to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the servant brought forth vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment and gave [them] to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they ate and drank, he and the men that [were] with him, and slept; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Then her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a [few] days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD has prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then they said, We will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they called Rebekah and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So they sent away Rebekah, their sister, and her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they blessed Rebekah and said unto her, Thou [art] our sister; be thou [the mother] of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels and followed the man; and the servant took Rebekah and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the land of the Negev.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Isaac had gone out to pray in the field at the evening hour; and he lifted up his eyes and saw, and, behold, the camels [were] coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Rebekah also lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>For she [had] asked the servant, What man [is] this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant [had] said, This [is] my master; therefore she took a veil and covered herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Then the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent and took Rebekah as [his] wife; and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's [death].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
