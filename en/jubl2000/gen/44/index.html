And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>[And] when they were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Rise up, follow after those men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[Is] this not [the one] in which my lord drinks and in which indeed he divines? Ye have done evil in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When he overtook them, he spoke unto them these same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said unto him, Why saith my lord these words? In no wise should thy servants do according to this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whoever of thy servants it is found, both let him die and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant, and ye shall be blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they made haste, and each one took his sack down to the ground, and each one opened his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched [and] began at the eldest and finished at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they rent their clothes, and each one laded his ass, and they returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, for he [was] yet there; and they fell before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said unto them, What deed [is] this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? What shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we and [he] also with whom the cup is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, in no wise should I do so; [but] the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go up in peace unto your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near unto him and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou [art] even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a young man of his old age, yet a lad; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou didst say unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me that I may set my eyes upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for [if] he should leave his father, [his father] would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou didst say unto thy servants, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go again [and] buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother [is] with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bore me two [sons];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and if ye take this one also from me and [some] disaster should befall him, ye shall bring my gray hairs with sorrow down to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad [is] not with us, seeing that his soul is bound up in the lad's soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>it shall come to pass when he sees that the lad [is] not [with us], that he will die: and thy servants shall bring the gray hairs of thy servant our father down with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the sin before my father for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant remain instead of the lad as a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I go up to my father and the lad not [be] with me? I cannot [go] lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
