And he divided the children unto Leah and unto Rachel and unto the two handmaids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he put the handmaids and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he passed over in front of them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, Who [are] those with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they also bowed themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, What [meanest] thou by all these droves which I met? And he said, To find grace in the sight of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast unto thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob said, No, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present from my hand, that for this I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God; and do me the pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee because God has dealt graciously with me, and all [that is here] is mine. And he urged him, and he took [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said unto him, My lord knows that the children [are] tender, and the sheep and cows with young [are] with me; and if men should overdrive them, in one day all the sheep will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let my lord, I pray thee, pass before his servant; and I will lead on softly, according as the property that goes before me and the children are able to endure until I come unto my lord unto Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee [some] of the folk that [are] with me. And he said, What for? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob came safe and sound to the city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram, and pitched his tent before the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he bought part of the field where he had spread his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred ewes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there he erected an altar, and called it Elelohe-Israel ([the Strong God of Israel]).:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
