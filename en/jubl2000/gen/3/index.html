And he said unto the woman, Has God indeed said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the woman answered unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it; neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For God knows that in the day ye eat of it then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] desirable to the eyes, and a tree of covetousness to understand, she took of its fruit and ate and gave also unto her husband with her; and he ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves girdles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD God called unto the man and said unto him, Where [art] thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he replied, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I [was] naked; and I hid myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, Who told thee that thou [wast] naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee not to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done?
