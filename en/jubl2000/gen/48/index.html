Then Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of peoples and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, [are] mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And those whom thou hast begotten after them shall be thine [and] shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because when I came from Padanaram, Rachel died unto me in the land of Canaan in the way when yet [there was] but a little way to come unto Ephrath; and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, which [is] Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Israel beheld Joseph's sons and said, Who [are] these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joseph said unto his father, They [are] my sons, whom God has given me in this [place].
