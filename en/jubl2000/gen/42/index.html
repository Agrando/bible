And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joseph knew his brethren but they did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them, Ye [are] spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said unto him, No, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We [are] all one man's sons; we are men of [the] truth, thy servants have never been spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said unto them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said, Thy servants [are] twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest [is] this day with our father, and one [is] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph said unto them, That [is it] that [which] I spoke unto you, saying, Ye [are] spies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth from here unless your youngest brother comes here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Send one of you and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved, whether [there is any] truth in you; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye [are] spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he put them all together into prison for three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said unto them the third day, Do this and live, [for] I fear God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye [are] men of [the] truth, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison; go ye, carry food for the famine of your houses</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but bring your youngest brother unto me, so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said one to another, We [are] truly guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak unto you, saying, Do not sin against the young man, and ye would not hear? Therefore, behold, his blood is also required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did not know that Joseph understood [them], for he spoke unto them by an interpreter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and spoke with them and took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with wheat and to restore each man's money into his sack and to give them provisions for the way; and thus it was done unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they laded their asses with the wheat and departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass fodder in the inn, he saw his money; for, behold, it [was] in his sack's mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, behold, [it is] even in my sack. And their heart failed [them], and they were afraid, saying one to another, What [is] this [that] God has done unto us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they came unto Jacob, their father, unto the land of Canaan and told him all that had befallen them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man, [who is] the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us for spies of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we said unto him, We [are] men of [the] truth; we have never been spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We [are] twelve brethren, sons of our father; one [is] not, and the youngest [is] this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby I shall know that ye [are] men of [the] truth; leave one of your brethren [here] with me and take [food for] the famine of your households and go</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and bring your youngest brother unto me; then I shall know that ye [are] not spies, but [that] ye [are] men of [the] truth; [thus] I will deliver you your brother, and ye shall trade in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, each man's bundle of money [was] in his sack; and when [both] they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob, their father, said unto them, Ye have bereaved me [of my sons]: Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will take Benjamin [away]; all these things are upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I do not bring him to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left; if [some] disaster should befall him by the way in which ye go, then shall ye bring my gray hairs with sorrow down to Sheol.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
