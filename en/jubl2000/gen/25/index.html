And she went to enquire of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said unto her, Two nations [are] in thy womb, and two [manner of] peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; and [the one] people shall be stronger than [the other] people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, [there were] twins in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And afterwards his brother came out with Esau's heel grasped in his hand; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac [was] sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the boys grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob [was] an upright man, remaining in the tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Isaac loved Esau because he ate of [his] venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob boiled pottage; and Esau came from the field, and he [was] faint;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and Esau said to Jacob, Give me to eat, I pray thee, of that red [pottage]; for I [am] faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die; and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jacob gave Esau of the bread and of the pottage of lentils; and he ate and drank, and rose up, and went away. Thus Esau despised [his] birthright.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
