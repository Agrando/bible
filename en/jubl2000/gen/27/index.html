And Esau went to the field to hunt [for] venison [and] to bring [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau, thy brother, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Bring me venison and make me savoury food that I may eat and bless thee before the LORD before my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now, therefore, my son, hearken unto my voice according to that which I command thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go now to the flock and bring me from there two good kids of the goats, and I will make them savoury food for thy father, such as he loves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and thou shalt bring [it] to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau, my brother, [is] a hairy man, and I [am] a smooth man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>my father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon myself, and not a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his mother said unto him, Upon me [be] thy curse, my son; only obey my voice and go bring me [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went and took them and brought [them] to his mother, and his mother made savoury food, such as his father loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Rebekah took good clothes of her eldest son Esau, which [were] with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob, her younger son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he came unto his father and said, My father, and he said, Here [am] I; who [art] thou, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jacob said unto his father, I [am] Esau, thy firstborn; I have done according as thou didst command me; arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Isaac said unto his son, How [is it] that thou hast found [it] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought [it] to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou [be] my very son Esau or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him and said, The voice [is] Jacob's voice, but the hands [are] the hands of Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he discerned him not because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, [Art] thou my very son Esau? And he said, I [am].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said, Bring [it] near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought [it] near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now and kiss me, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came near and kissed him, and he smelled the smell of his clothing and blessed him and said, See, the smell of my son [is] as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore [let] God give thee of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of wheat and new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let the peoples serve thee and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee; cursed [be] every one that curses thee, and blessed [be] he that blesses thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he also had made savory food and brought it unto his father and said unto his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's venison that thy soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Isaac his father said unto him, Who [art] thou? And he said, I [am] thy son, thy firstborn Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Isaac trembled very exceedingly and said, Who [is] he that has taken venison and brought [it to] me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest? I have blessed him and he shall be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father, Bless me, [even] me also, O my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said, Thy brother came with deceit and has taken away thy blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times; he took away my birthright, and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren I have given to him for servants, and with wheat and new wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now unto thee, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, [even] me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of the heavens from above,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother; yet there shall be a time when thou shalt have dominion, and thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will slay my brother Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And these words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, does comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now therefore, my son, hear my voice and arise; flee unto Laban, my brother, to Haran</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and dwell with him a few days until thy brother's fury turns away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>until thy brother's anger turns away from thee, and he forgets [that] which thou hast done to him; then I will send, and bring thee from there; for why should I be deprived of you both in one day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these [who are] of the daughters of this land, why should I want to live?:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
