And Abel was a pastor of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground a present unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD looked upon Abel and his present,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but he did not look upon Cain and his present. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If thou doest good, it shall certainly be accepted; and if thou doest not good, sin lies at the door. And his desire shall be unto thee, but thou must rule over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Cain talked with Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not, [Am] I my brother's keeper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cries unto me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now thou [art] cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>when thou tillest the ground, from now on it shall not yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said unto the LORD, My iniquity [is] greater than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I hide; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass [that] anyone that finds me shall slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begat Mehujael, and Mehujael begat Methusael, and Methusael begat Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of the one [was] Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and [of those who have] cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his brother's name [was] Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the harp and organ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Zillah also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and the sister of Tubalcain [was] Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech, for I shall slay a man for my wound and a young man for my hurt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>if Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth; for God, [said she], has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos.
