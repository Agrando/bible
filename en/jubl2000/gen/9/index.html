into your hand they are delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; even as the green grass I have given you all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But flesh with the soul ([or life]) thereof, [which is] its blood, ye shall not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For surely your blood [which is] your souls I will require; at the hand of every animal I will require it and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother I will require the soul ([or life]) of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoever sheds man's blood in man, his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God is man made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you, be ye fruitful and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God spoke unto Noah and to his sons with him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold that I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and with every living soul that [is] with you, of the fowl, of the animals, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark to every animal of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that I will establish my covenant with you, that all flesh shall not be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said, This [is] the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living soul that [is] with you, for perpetual ages:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it shall come to pass when I bring clouds over the earth, that the bow shall appear in the clouds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living soul of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living soul of all flesh that [is] upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God said unto Noah, This [shall be] the sign of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that [is] upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham [is] the father of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These [are] the three sons of Noah; and of them was the whole earth overspread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Noah began to till the ground, and he planted a vineyard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he drank of the wine and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid [it] upon both their shoulders and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
