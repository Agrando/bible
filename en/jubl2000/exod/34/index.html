And as he came out, he would speak unto the sons of Israel [that] which he was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses that the skin of Moses' face shone, and Moses would put the veil upon his face again until he would go in to speak with him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
