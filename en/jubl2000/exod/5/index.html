I do not know the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has found us; therefore we shall go three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the LORD our God lest he encounter us with pestilence or with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king of Egypt said unto them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, keep the people from their works? Go unto your burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Pharaoh also said, Behold, the people of the land now [are] many, and ye make them cease from their burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye shall no longer give the people firewood to make brick as until now; let them go and gather firewood for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the tally of the bricks which they made before, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish any of it; for they [are] idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go [and] sacrifice to our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let more work be laid upon them that they may occupy themselves with it; and let them not regard words of deception.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you firewood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go ye, gather firewood where ye can find it; yet none of your work shall be diminished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather brush for firewood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the taskmasters hasted [them], saying, Fulfil your works, [your] daily quotas, as when there was firewood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and they] demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your quotas in making brick both yesterday and today, as until now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Why doest thou deal thus with thy servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There is no firewood given unto thy servants, yet they say to us, Make brick. Behold, thy servants [are] beaten; and thy people sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he replied, Ye [are] idle, [ye] are idle, therefore ye say, Let us go [and] sacrifice unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Go therefore now [and] work, for no firewood shall be given you, yet ye shall deliver the tally of bricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the officers of the sons of Israel saw [that] they [were] afflicted after it was said, Ye shall not diminish any from the bricks of your daily quota.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they said unto them, The LORD look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be a stench before Pharaoh and his servants, putting a sword in their hands to slay us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Moses returned unto the LORD and said, Lord, why hast thou [so] afflicted this people? Why [is] it [that] thou hast sent me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has afflicted this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
