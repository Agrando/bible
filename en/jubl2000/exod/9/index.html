But the heart of Pharaoh hardened, and he did not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, [Let] each of you take handfuls of soot from the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall become dust upon all the land of Egypt, which shall cause boils breaking forth [with] blisters upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they took the soot of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and boils breaking forth [with] blisters came upon man and upon beast</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[until] the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did hearken unto them as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For [otherwise] this time I will send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou may know that [there is] none like me in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For now I will stretch out my hand that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For in truth I have placed thee to declare my power in thee, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou even so dost exalt thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Send therefore now [and] gather thy livestock and all that thou hast in the field; [for upon] every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he that did not regard the word of the LORD left his servants and his livestock in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon the men and upon the beasts and upon all the grass of the field throughout the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven, and the LORD raised his voice and it hailed, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So there was hail and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And that hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that [was] in the field, both men and beasts; and the hail smote all the grass of the field and broke all the trees of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel [were], was there no hail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron and said unto them, I have sinned this time; the LORD [is] righteous, and I and my people [are] wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Intreat the LORD that the thunderings of God and the hail [might] cease; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay here no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses replied unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will extend my hands unto the LORD; [and] the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou may know how that the earth [is] the LORD'S.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But I know thee and thy servants from before ye began to fear the presence of the LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The flax, therefore, and the barley were smitten, for the barley [was] headed out, and the flax [was] in stalk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they [were] late.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses went out from the presence of Pharaoh and [out] of the city and extended his hands unto the LORD; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he persevered in [his] sin and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the heart of Pharaoh hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go as the LORD had spoken by Moses.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
