it [shall be] the first month of the year to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Speak unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth [day] of this month let each man take a lamb according to the families of the fathers, a lamb per family;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and if the household is too small and [is] not [able] to eat the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take [it] according to the number of persons; each one according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The lamb shall be without blemish, a male of one year; ye shall take [it] out from the sheep or from the goats;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it between the two evenings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall take of the blood and put [it] on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses in which they shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread; [and] with bitter [herbs] they shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Eat none of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast [with] fire, his head with his legs, and with the entrails thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remains of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thus shall ye eat it: [with] your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it [is] the LORD'S passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both [among] man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this blood shall be to you for a sign upon the houses where ye [are]; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy [you], when I smite the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it as a feast unto the LORD throughout your ages; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the first day [there shall be] a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, except [that] which every person must eat, that only may be done of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And ye shall observe [the feast of] unleavened bread, for in this same day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore, shall ye observe this day for your ages by an ordinance forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a stranger or born in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations ye shall eat unleavened bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them, Draw out and take lambs according to your families and sacrifice the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip [it] in the blood that [is] in the basin and touch the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that [is] in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the LORD will pass through smiting the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over that door and will not allow the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite [you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it shall come to pass, when ye have entered into the land which the LORD will give you, according as he has promised, that ye shall keep this service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What do you mean by this service?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That ye shall say, It [is] the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses. Then the people bowed and worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Israel went away, and as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that [was] in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for [there was] not a house where [there was] not one dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said, Rise up, [and] get you forth from among my people, both ye and the sons of Israel, and go, serve the LORD as ye have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Also take your sheep and your cows, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste, for they said, We [are] all dead [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked the Egyptians for vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the LORD gave the people grace in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they gave unto them [such things as they required]. And they spoiled the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, not [counting] the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a mixed multitude went up also with them and many sheep and cows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry nor prepare food for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now the time that the sons of Israel dwelt in Egypt [was] four hundred and thirty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even that same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It [is] a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this night [should] be observed unto the LORD by all the sons of Israel in their ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This [shall be] the ordinance of the passover: No stranger shall eat of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The foreigner and the hired servant shall not eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>It shall be eaten in one house; thou shalt not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All the congregation of Israel shall make this [sacrifice].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And if a stranger shall sojourn with thee and desire to make the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and make this [sacrifice]; and he shall be as one that is natural in the land, but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The same law shall be for the one who is natural, and for the stranger that sojourns among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Thus did all the sons of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass that same day [that] the LORD did bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
