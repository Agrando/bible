These [are] the words which thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people answered together and said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, I come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and be ready for the third day; for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves [that ye go not] up into the mount or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mount shall surely die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Not a hand shall touch it, but that he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether [it be] beast or man, it shall not live. When the jubilee sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day; come not at [your] women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass on the third day when the morning came, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the shofar exceeding loud, so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the lower part of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all Mount Sinai smoked because the LORD had descended upon it in fire, and its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the voice of the shofar sounded long and waxed louder and louder; Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mount, and the LORD called Moses [up] to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people lest they break through [the bounds] to gaze upon the LORD, and many of them perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And also let the priests who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves lest the LORD break forth upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for thou hast charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount and sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee, but let not the priests and the people break through [the bounds] to come up unto the LORD lest he break forth upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down unto the people and spoke unto them.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
