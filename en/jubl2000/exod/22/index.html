[the thief] should make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If he is found with the theft in his hand, whether it be ox or ass or sheep, he shall restore double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten and shall put in his beast and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When fires are lit and in burning the thorns burn also the stacks of sheaves or the standing grain, or the field is consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found, let him pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges [to see] whether he has put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all manner of fraud, [whether it be] for [an] ox, for [an] ass, for [a] sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, which [another] challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; [and] whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If a man delivers unto his neighbour an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep, and it dies or is hurt or driven away, no man seeing [it],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[then] shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he has not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods, and the owner of it shall accept [thereof], and he shall not make [it] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto its owner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If it is torn in pieces, [then] let him bring witness, [and] he shall not make good that which was torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if anyone borrows [anything] of his neighbour, and it is hurt or dies, its owner not [being] with it, he shall surely make [it] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[But] if its owner [is] with it, he shall not make [it] good;

the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen [and] with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it [to] me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye shall be holy men unto me; neither shall ye eat [any] flesh [that is] torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
