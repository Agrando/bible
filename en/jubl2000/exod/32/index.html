Then they said, These [are] thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And seeing this, Aaron built an altar before the [calf]; and Aaron made [a] proclamation and said, Tomorrow [shall be] a feast unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they rose up early on the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go, descend; for thy people, which thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted [themselves]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed unto it and said, These [are] thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of [the] land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The LORD further said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and for certain it [is] a stiffnecked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot in them and consume them; and I will put thee over [a] great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Moses grieved before the LORD his God and said, LORD, why shall thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why should the Egyptians speak and say, For evil did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from upon the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of the evil of thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst sware by thine own self and hast said unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall take it for inheritance for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the LORD repented of the evil which he said should be done unto his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turned and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony [were] in his hand; the tables [were] written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other [were] they written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the tables [were] the work of God, and the writing [was] the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua, hearing the noise of the people as they shouted, said unto Moses, [There is] a noise of war in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he answered, [It is] not the voice of [those that] shout for mastery, neither [is it] the voice of [those that] cry for being overcome, [but] the noise of [those that] sing that I hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass as soon as he came near unto the camp and he saw the calf and the dances, anger caused Moses to wax hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the calf which they had made and burnt [it] in the fire and ground [it] to powder and scattered [it] upon the waters and made the sons of Israel drink [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people [do] unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron answered, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot; thou knowest the people that they [are inclined] to evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us, for [as for] this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what is become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I answered unto them, Whoever has any gold, let them break [it] off. So they gave [it to] me and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Moses saw that the people [were] naked (for Aaron had made them naked unto [their] shame among their enemies),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Who [is] on the LORD'S side? [Come] unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said unto them, Thus hath the LORD God of Israel said, Put every man his sword by his side [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay each one his brother and his companion and his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Moses had said, Today you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, for each one [has consecrated] in his son and in his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass on the next day that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin, but now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make reconciliation for your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Moses returned unto the LORD and said, I pray thee, [for], this people [who] have sinned a great sin and have made themselves gods of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that thou wilt forgive their sin; and if not, blot me now out of thy book which thou hast written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the LORD answered unto Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, this one will [I] blot out of my book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore go now, lead the people unto [the place] of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, my Angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day of my visitation [I] will visit their sin in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD smote the people because they had made the calf, which Aaron formed.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
