And he said, Here [am] I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said, Do not come near; take off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place upon which thou dost stand [is] holy ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses covered his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who [are] in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and broad land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the places of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has now come before me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou may bring forth my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Moses said unto God, Who [am] I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this [shall be] a token unto thee that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said unto God, Behold, [when] I come unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, The God of your fathers has sent me unto you, and if they say to me, What [is] his name? What shall I say unto them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God answered unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel: I AM ([YHWH]) has sent me unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel: The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me unto you. This [is] my name for ever, and this [is] my memorial unto all ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you and [seen] that which is done to you in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall hearken to thy voice, and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has found us; therefore, we shall now go three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go except by a mighty hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof, and after that he will let you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give this people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but every woman shall demand of her neighbour and of her that sojourns in her house, vessels of silver and vessels of gold and clothing; and ye shall put [them] upon your sons and upon your daughters, and ye shall spoil Egypt.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
