and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he was married, then his wife shall go out with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If his master has given him a wife, and she has born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if a man should sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If she pleases not her master, who therefore took her not unto himself to wife, then it is permitted that she be ransomed; and he may not sell her unto a strange nation when he rejects her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he has betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he takes another [wife], her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, he shall not diminish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if he does not do these three [things] unto her, then shall she go out free without money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that smites a man so that he dies shall be surely put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if a man did not lie in wait but God delivered [him] into his hand, then I will appoint thee a place where he shall flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if a man comes presumptuously upon his neighbour to slay him with prudence, thou shalt take him from my altar that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he that smites his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Likewise he that steals a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the same manner he that curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if men strive together and one smites another with a stone or with [his] fist and he dies not, but keeps [his] bed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>if he rises again and walks abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote [him] be absolved, only he shall pay [for] the loss of his time and shall cause [him] to be thoroughly healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if a man smites his servant or his maid with a rod and he dies under his hand, he shall be surely punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Notwithstanding, if he continues a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he [is] his money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If men strive and hurt a woman with child so that she aborts but without death, he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay by the judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if there is death, then thou shalt pay life for life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if someone smites the eye of their servant or the eye of their maid that it perishes, he shall let them go free for their eye's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if he smites out his manservant's tooth or his maidservant's tooth, he shall let them go free for their tooth's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If an ox gores a man or a woman that they die, then the ox shall surely be stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox [shall be] absolved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past and it has been testified to his owner, and he has not kept him in, but that he has killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If there is laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If the ox shall gore a manservant or a maidservant, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if someone shall open a pit or if someone shall dig a pit and not cover it and an ox or an ass falls in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the owner of the pit shall make [it] good [and] give money unto their owner, and the dead [beast] shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if one man's ox hurts another's that he dies; then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money of it, and the dead [ox] they shall also divide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or if it is known that the ox used to push in time past and his owner has not kept him in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his own.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
