And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? Why do ye tempt the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses and said, Why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of Israel and thy rod, with which thou didst smite the river take in thine hand and go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb, and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the chiding of the sons of Israel and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; but when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses' hands [were] heavy, so they took a stone and put [it] under him, and he sat upon it; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side and the other on the other side; thus his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joshua disabled Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this [for] a memorial in the book and tell Joshua that I must utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses built an altar and called the name of it The LORD is my Banner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for he said, Because [Amalek lifted] his hand against the throne of the LORD, the LORD [will have] war with Amalek from generation to generation.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
