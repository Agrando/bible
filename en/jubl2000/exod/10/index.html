Let my people go that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring the locusts into thy borders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they shall cover the face of the earth that one will not be able to see the earth, and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which produces [fruit] for you out of the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself and went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? Let the men go that they may serve the LORD their God; knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God. Who [are] those that shall go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses replied, We must go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep and with our cows we must go; for we have a solemn feast unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said unto them, Even if the LORD be with you, how can I let you go with your little ones; look at the malice which is before your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It [shall] not [be] so: go now ye [that are] men and serve the LORD; for that is what ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt to bring the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat all the grass of the land [and] all that the hail has left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all [that] night; [and] when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and landed in all the borders of Egypt. Very grievous [were they]; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall [there] be such.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate all the grass of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; and there did not remain any green thing in the trees or in the grass of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he went out from Pharaoh and intreated the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the sons of Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness [which] may be felt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They did not see one another, neither did any rise from his place for three days; but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Pharaoh called unto Moses and said, Go, serve the LORD; only let your sheep and your cows remain; let your little ones also go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses replied, Thou also must give us sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our cattle shall also go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind; for we must take thereof to serve the LORD our God; and we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said unto him, Go from me, take heed to thyself to see my face no more; for in [the] day that thou seest my face thou shalt die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses replied, Thou hast spoken well, I will not see thy face again.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
