And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was told the king of Egypt how the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he made ready his chariot and took his people with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and the captains over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel, but the sons of Israel had already left with great power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Egyptians, nevertheless, pursued after them with all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and all his army, and overtook them setting up camp by the sea beside Pihahiroth before Baalzephon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they feared greatly, and the sons of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they said unto Moses, Because [there were] no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>[Is] this not what we told thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians? For [it would have been] better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still and see the saving health of the LORD, which he will bestow on you today; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall never see them again for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall be still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Why criest thou unto me? Speak unto the sons of Israel that they go forward:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And lift up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it; and the sons of Israel shall go on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians that they shall follow them: and I will be glorified in Pharaoh and in all his host, in his chariots, and in his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have glorified myself in Pharaoh, in his chariots, and in his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and likewise the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness [to them], but it lit up the night [unto Israel]; and all that night the one [side] never came near the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry [land], and the waters were divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry [ground]; and the waters [were] a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea, [even] all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass that in the morning watch the LORD looked at the camp of the Egyptians in the pillar of fire and of cloud and troubled the camp of the Egyptians</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and took off their chariot wheels and overturned them grievously, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned in its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen [and] all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the sons of Israel walked upon dry [land] in the midst of the sea; and the waters [were] a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did against the Egyptians; and the people feared the LORD and believed the LORD and his servant Moses.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
