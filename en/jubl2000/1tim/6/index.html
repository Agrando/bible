Teach and exhort this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but is driven mad concerning questions and controversy of words, of which comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>perverse disputings of men of corrupt understanding, and destitute of the truth, using piety as a source of gain: from such withdraw thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But piety with contentment is great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into [this] world, [and it is] certain we can carry nothing out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So that, sustenance and covering, let us be content with this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For those that desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But thou, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, charity, tolerance, meekness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, unto which thou art also called, having made a good profession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I give thee charge in the sight of God, who gives life to all things and [before] Christ Jesus, who testified before Pontius Pilate a good profession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that thou keep the commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who in his time shall show the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the only one who has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man has seen nor can see, to whom [be] honour and power everlasting.
