your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and neither has thy shoe waxed old upon thy foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ye have never eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink that ye might know that I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when ye came unto this place, Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reuben and unto Gad and to the half tribe of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou shalt keep, therefore, the words of this covenant and do them that ye may understand all that ye do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ye stand today, all of you, before the LORD your God, your princes of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, [with] all the men of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>your little ones, your wives, and thy strangers that dwell within thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that thou may enter into covenant with the LORD thy God and into his oath, which the LORD thy God makes with thee today,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>to confirm thee today as his people and [that] he may be unto thee as God, as he has said unto thee, and as he has sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but with those that stand here with us today before the LORD our God and also with those that are not here with us today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the Gentiles which ye passed by;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and ye have seen their abominations and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which [they have] among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Peradventure there shall be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God to go [and] serve the gods of those Gentiles; peradventure there shall be among you a root that bears poison and wormwood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and it shall be, that when that one hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The LORD will not forgive him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid upon it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[and that] the whole land thereof [is] brimstone and salt [and] burning, [that] it is not sown, nor shall it produce [anything], nor shall any grass grow therein, like in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger and in his wrath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>even all Gentiles shall say, Why has the LORD done thus unto this land? What [means] the heat of this great anger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for they went and served other gods and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not and who had not given anything unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land, as [it is] today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The hidden things of the LORD our God are uncovered unto us and to our children for ever, that [we] may do all the words of this law.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
