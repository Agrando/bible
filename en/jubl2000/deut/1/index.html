go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give unto them and to their seed after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, ye [are] this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the LORD God of your fathers add upon you a thousand times so many more as ye [are] and bless you, as he has promised!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How can [I] myself alone bear your troubles and your burdens and your strife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Give me from among you, of your tribes, wise and understanding and expert men, and I will make them the head [over you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ye answered me and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good [for us] to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I took the principals of your tribes, wise men and experts, and made them princes over you, princes over thousands and princes over hundreds and princes over fifties and princes over tens and officers among your tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren and judge righteously between [every] man and his brother and the stranger [that is] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, [but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's; and the cause that is too hard for you, bring [it] unto me, and I will hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[Then I] said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorite, which the LORD our God gives unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, the LORD thy God has given the land before thee; go up [and] possess [it], as the LORD God of thy fathers has said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye came near unto me every one of you and said, We will send men before us, and they shall spy us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the saying seemed good unto me, and I took twelve men of you, one of each tribe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they turned and went up into the mountain and came unto the valley of Eshcol and spied out [the land].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought [it] down unto us and brought us word again and said, [It is] a good land which the LORD our God gives us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and ye murmured in your tents and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorite, to destroy us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Where shall we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, This people [is] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The LORD your God who goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did with you in Egypt before your eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and in the wilderness thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went until ye came into this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet with all this ye did not believe in the LORD your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents, with fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and with a cloud by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the LORD heard the voice of your words and was angry and swore, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his sons, because he has perfectly followed the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou shalt not go in there either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>[But] Joshua, the son of Nun, who stands before thee, he shall go in there; encourage him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Moreover your little ones, whom ye said should be a prey and your children who in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in there, and unto them will I give it, and they shall inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But [as for] you, return and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>[Then] ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God has commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Do not go up or fight, for I [am] not among you, lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So I spoke unto you, and ye would not hear but were rebels against the word of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Amorite, who dwelt in that mountain, came out against you and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, [even] unto Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And ye returned and wept before the LORD, but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode [there].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
