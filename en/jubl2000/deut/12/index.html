and ye shall hew down the statues of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But ye shall seek the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there for his habitation, and thou shalt go there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and the offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill [offerings] and the firstborn of your cows and of your sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye and your households shall rejoice in every work of your hands in which the LORD thy God has blessed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ye shall not do after all [the things] that we do here this day, each man doing what [seems] right in his own eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But [when] ye pass the Jordan and dwell in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit and [when] he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; there shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the offerings of your hand and all your choice of vows which ye vow unto the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your maidservants and the Levite that [is] within your gates because he has no part nor inheritance with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Keep thyself that thou not offer thy burnt offerings in any place that thou seest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes;

enquire not after their gods, saying, After the manner that these Gentiles served their gods, even so will I do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God; for every abomination unto the LORD, which he hates, they have done unto their gods; for they have even burnt their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Keep thyself, [and] do all that I command you;
