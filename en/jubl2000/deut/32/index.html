[Is] he not thy father [that] has possessed thee? He made thee and established thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations; ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>when the most High caused the Gentiles to be inherited, when he separated the sons of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the LORD'S portion [is] his people; Jacob [is] the measuring line of his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so the LORD alone did lead him, and [there was] no strange god with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the fruits of the field; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the strong flint,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>butter of cows and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs and rams of the sons of Bashan [(or fruitfulness)] and goats with the fat of kidneys, of wheat; and thou didst drink the blood of the grape, [pure] wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jeshurun [(the upright one)] waxed fat and kicked; (thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou hast covered thyself) and forsook the God [who] made him and lightly esteemed the strong One of his saving health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They provoked him to jealousy with strange [gods]; with abominations they provoked him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They sacrificed unto devils, not to God, to gods whom they knew not, to new [gods that] came from nearby, whom your fathers feared not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of the strong One [that] begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten the God that travailed for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the LORD saw [it], his wrath was [kindled because of] his sons and of his daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, I will hide my face from them; I will see what their end [shall be]: that they [are] a generation of perversities, sons without faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have moved me to jealousy with [that which is] not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities; and I also will move them to jealousy with [those who are] not a people; I will provoke them to anger with foolish Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For fire shall be kindled in my anger and shall burn unto the lowest [part of] Sheol and shall consume the earth with her fruit and burn up the foundations of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will heap evils upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[They shall be] consumed with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction; I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sword without and terror within shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling [also] with the man of gray hairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I said I would shatter them in pieces: I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>if I did not fear the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should become vain [and] lest they should say, Our high hand has done this and not the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For they [are] a Gentile void of counsel, neither [is there any] intelligence in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O that they were wise, [if] they were prudent, they would understand their latter end!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How could one chase a thousand and two put ten thousands to flight if their strong One had not sold them, and the LORD had not delivered them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For their strong one [is] not as our strong One, and [even] our enemies are judges [of this].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, their vine [is] of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes [are] grapes of gall, their clusters [are] very bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their wine [is] the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of asps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Do I not have this laid up in store, sealed up in my treasuries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Vengeance and recompense are mine, in the time when their foot shall slide; for the day of their calamity [is] at hand and that which is determined upon them makes haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the LORD shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he sees that [their] power is gone, and [there is] none shut up or left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he shall say, Where [are] their gods, [their] strong one in whom they trusted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>who ate the fat of their sacrifices [and] drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you, [and] be your protection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See now that I, I [am] he, and [there are] no gods with me; I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; and there is not one that can deliver out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When I shall lift up my hand to the heavens and shall say, I live for ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>if I whet the resplendence of my sword and my hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to my enemies and will recompense those that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will make my arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh, in the blood of the slain and of the captives of the heads, in revenge as an enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Rejoice, O ye Gentiles, [with] his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his enemies and will reconcile his land, to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hosea, the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I protest against you today, to command them unto your children and keep and fulfil all the words of this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For it [is] not a vain thing for you because it [is] your life; and through this thing ye shall prolong [your] days in the land, which ye shall pass the Jordan to inherit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses that same day, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Climb up into this mountain Abarim, [unto] mount Nebo, which [is] in the land of Moab, that [is] over against Jericho, and behold the land of Canaan, which I give as inheritance unto the sons of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and die in the mountain which thou shalt climb and be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered unto his peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>because ye trespassed against me among the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because ye did not sanctify me in the midst of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Yet thou shalt see the land before [thee], but thou shalt not enter there to the land which I give the sons of Israel.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
