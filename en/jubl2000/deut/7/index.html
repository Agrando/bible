thou shalt make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods; and the anger of the LORD will be kindled upon you and destroy thee suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thou [art] a holy people unto the LORD thy God; the LORD thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, different from all the peoples that [are] upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Not because ye were more than the other peoples has the LORD desired you and chosen you; for ye [were] the fewest of all the peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but because the LORD loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, has the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand and ransomed you out of the house of bondage from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know, therefore, that the LORD thy God, he [is] God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and mercy with those that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and repays him that hates him to his face, to destroy him; he will not be slack to him that hates him; he will repay him to his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Keep, therefore, the commandments and statutes and rights, which I command thee this day, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, for having heard these rights and for having kept them [by] doing them that the LORD thy God shall keep the covenant with thee and the mercy which he swore unto thy fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee; he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land, thy grain and thy wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cows and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he swore unto thy fathers to give thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee, but will lay them upon all [those] that hate thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou shalt consume all the peoples which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be] a snare unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When thou shalt say in thy heart, These Gentiles [are] more than I; how can I dispossess them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not be afraid of them; remember well what the LORD thy God did with Pharaoh and with all Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>of the great trials which thine eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which the LORD thy God brought thee out; so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the peoples of whose presence thou art afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them until those that are left and hide themselves from thee are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shalt not faint before them; for the LORD thy God is among you, a great and terrible God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD thy God will put out those Gentiles before thee little by little; thou may not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven; no one shall be able to stand before thee until thou hast destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The graven images of their gods ye shall burn in the fire; thou shalt not desire the silver or gold [that is] on them nor take [it] unto thee lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest thou become an anathema like it, [but] thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it [is] anathema.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
