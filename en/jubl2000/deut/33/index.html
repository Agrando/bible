he shined forth from Mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of holiness, at his right hand the law of fire for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yea, he loved the peoples; all his saints [are] in thy hand; they also united at thy feet; they received thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moses commanded us law as inheritance unto the congregation of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he was king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people, the tribes of Israel, were gathered together as one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let Reuben live and not die, and let [not] his men be few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this [blessing is] for Judah, and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people; let his hands be sufficient for him, and be thou a help [to him] from his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to Levi he said, [Let] thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah [and with] whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen them; neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor know his own children; therefore, they shall keep thy word and guard thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thy nostrils and a perfect [sacrifice] upon thine altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Bless, O LORD, his ministry, and take pleasure in the work of his hands; smite through the loins of those that rise up against him and of those that hate him that they may never rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; [and the LORD] shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And to Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD [is] his land, for the gifts of the heavens, for the dew, and for the deep that is stretched out beneath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and for the gifts of the fruits of the sun and for the gifts of the influence of the moon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and for the summit of the ancient mountains and for the gifts of the everlasting hills,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and for the gifts of the earth and fullness thereof, and may the grace of him that dwelt in the bush come upon the head of Joseph and upon the top of the head of him [that was] separated from his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His beauty [is like] the firstborn of his bullock, and his horns [are like] the horns of unicorns; with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth; these [are] the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these [are] the thousands of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and thou, Issachar, in thy tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; therefore they shall suck the abundance of the seas and hidden treasures of the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to Gad he said, Blessed [is] he that caused Gad to be enlarged; he shall dwell as a lion and shall tear the arm with the crown of the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he saw the best for himself because there the portion of the lawgiver was enclosed; and he came at the head of the people; he shall execute the righteousness of the LORD and his judgments with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And to Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp; he shall leap from Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And to Naphtali he said, Naphtali, filled with grace and full of the blessing of the LORD, shall inherit the west and the Negev.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And to Asher he said, Asher, more blessed than the sons, shall be acceptable unto his brethren and shall dip his foot in oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thy locks [shall be] iron and brass; and as thy days, [so shall] thy strength [be].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[There is] no [other] like unto the God of Jeshurun, [who] rides upon the heavens for thy help, in the clouds with his excellency.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The habitation of God is eternal, and underneath the everlasting arms; he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say, Destroy [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Israel, the fountain of Jacob, shall dwell in safety alone in a land of grain and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Blessed [art] thou, O Israel, who [is] like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help and the sword of thy excellency? Thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high places.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
