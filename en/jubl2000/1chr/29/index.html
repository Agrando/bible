And who [then] is willing to consecrate [the offering] of his hands today unto the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the princes of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the princes of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents of gold and ten thousand daily wages and ten thousand talents of silver and eighteen thousand talents of brass and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And each one gave the precious stones that they had to the treasure of the house of the LORD, into the hand of Jehiel, the Gershonite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the people rejoiced to have offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD. Likewise, David the king rejoiced with great joy</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and blessed the LORD before all the congregation; and David said, Blessed [be] thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thine, O LORD, [is] the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the honour, for all things in the heavens and in the earth [are thine]; thine [is] the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The riches and the glory are before thee, and thou dost reign over all, and in thy hand [is] power and might and in thy hand the greatness and the strength of all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But who [am] I, and what [is] my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things [come] of thee and of thine own have we given thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we [are] strangers before thee, and sojourners, as [were] all our fathers; our days on the earth [are] as a shadow, and [there is] no other hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name [comes] of thy hand and [is] all thy own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I know also, my God, that thou dost try the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy that thy people, who are present here, have given willingly unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep for ever this purpose in the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Likewise, give unto Solomon, my son, a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all [these things], and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers and bowed down and worshipped before the LORD and the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the next day, [even] a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, [and] a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon, the son of David, king the second time and anointed [him] unto the LORD as ruler and Zadok as priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David, his father, and was prospered; and all Israel heard him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of King David, submitted themselves unto Solomon, the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed upon him [such] glory of the kingdom as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus David, the son of Jesse, reigned over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the time that he reigned over Israel [was] forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three [years] in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and glory; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the acts of David, the king, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of Samuel, the seer, and in the book of Nathan, the prophet, and in the book of Gad, the seer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him and over Israel and over all the kingdoms of the lands.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
