sanctify yourselves and your brethren and bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto [the place] that I have prepared for it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for because ye did not [do it thus] at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us because we did not seek him according to his ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the sons of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint of their brethren as singers with instruments of music, with psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding, and to lift up their voice with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the Levites appointed Heman, the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph, the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari and of their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and with them their brethren of the second order, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, raised their voices with cymbals of brass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Chenaniah, prince of the Levites in prophecy, for he presided in prophecy, because he [had] understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Berechiah and Elkanah [were] doorkeepers for the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Shebaniah, Jehoshaphat, Nethaneel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God;
