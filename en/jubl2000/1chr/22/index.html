So David prepared abundantly before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he called for Solomon, his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of the LORD my God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars; thou shalt not build a house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about, for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall build a house for my name, and he shall be my son, and I [will be] his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, my son, the LORD be with thee, and be thou prospered and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he has said of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee commandments for Israel, and that thou keep the law of the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then shalt thou be prospered if thou shalt keep thyself to do the statutes and rights which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel; be strong and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD one hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and the brass and iron are without weight, for it is in abundance.
