Nevertheless, David took the fortress of Zion, which [is] the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said, Whoever smites the Jebusites first shall be head and prince. So Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up first and was made the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David dwelt in the fortress; therefore, they called it the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about, and Joab restored the rest of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David waxed greater and greater, for the LORD of the hosts [was] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These also [are] the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this [is] the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, of Hachmoni, the chief of the captains; he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain at one time and killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after him [was] Eleazar, the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who [was one] of the three mighties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where [there] was an inheritance of land full of barley; and as the people fled from before the Philistines,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>they set themselves in the midst of [that] portion and delivered it and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved [them] by a great salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now three of the thirty principal ones went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the camp of the Philistines was pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David [was] then in the fortress, and the Philistines' garrison [was] then at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David longed and said, Oh, that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that [is] at the gate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And those three broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that [was] by the gate and took [it] and brought [it] to David; but David would not drink [of] it, but poured it out to the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and said, May God keep me from doing this thing.
