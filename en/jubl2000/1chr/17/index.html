I have humbled all thy enemies and announce unto thee that the LORD will build thee a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled to go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne eternally.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son; and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took [it] from [him] that was before thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom for ever, and his throne shall be established for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David, the king, came and sat before the LORD and said, Who [am] I, O LORD God, and what [is] my house, that thou hast brought me here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And [yet] this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God, for thou hast [also] spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What more can David add asking thee to glorify thy servant? For thou knowest thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, for thy servant's sake and according to thy own heart, thou hast done all this greatness, in making known all thy great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O LORD, [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what one nation in the earth [is] like thy people Israel, whom God went to ransom [to be] his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out the Gentiles from before thy people, whom thou didst redeem out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever, and thou, LORD, didst become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, that it may be said, The LORD of the hosts, God of Israel, is God unto Israel; and [let] the house of David thy servant [be] established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore, thy servant has found [in his heart] to pray before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, LORD, thou art God and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>now it has pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, O LORD, hast blessed it, and [it shall be] blessed for ever.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
