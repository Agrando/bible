[Is] not this written in the book of righteousness? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there was no day like that before it or after it that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told unto Joshua that the five kings had been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and do not stop, [but] pursue after your enemies and smite their rearguard without allowing them to enter into their cities; for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, that those who remained of them entered into strong cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace; there was no one to move his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, [and] the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had brought those kings out unto Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near; put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua said unto them, Do not fear, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage; for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And afterward Joshua smote them and slew them and caused them to be hanged on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded that they take them down off the trees and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and they laid great stones in the cave's mouth, [which remain] until this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In that same day Joshua took Makkedah and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them and all the souls that [were] therein; he let no one remain; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him unto Libnah and fought against Libnah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hands of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that [were] therein; he let no one remain in it, but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him unto Lachish and encamped against it and fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that [were] therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to help Lachish, and Joshua smote him and his people until none of them were left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon and all Israel with him, and they encamped against it and fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they took it that same day and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] in it he utterly destroyed that same day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they took it and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and all the souls that [were] in it; he left no one remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but destroyed it utterly and all the souls that [were] therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Joshua returned and all Israel with him to Debir and fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and he took it and the king thereof and all the cities thereof, and they smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls that [were] in it; he left no one remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and to the king thereof, as he had done also to Libnah and to her king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the Negev and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings; he left no one remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza and all the country of Goshen even unto Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All these kings and their lands Joshua took at one time because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp to Gilgal.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
