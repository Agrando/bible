And the men went up and spied out Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they returned to Joshua and said unto him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; do not make all the people to labour there; for they [are but] few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So about three thousand men of the people went up there; and they fled before the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men; for they chased them [from] before the gate [even] unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down; therefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, putting dust upon their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou caused this people to pass the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? We should have been content and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O Lord, what shall I say now that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear [of it] and shall compass us around and cut off our name from upon the earth; then what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get up; why dost thou lie thus upon thy face?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Israel has sinned and has even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; for they have even taken of the anathema and have also stolen and lied also, and they have even put [it] in their own vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, the sons of Israel could not stand before their enemies, [but] shall turn [their] backs before their enemies because they have been in the anathema; neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the anathema from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Get up, sanctify the people and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [There is] anathema in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thy enemies until ye take away the anathema from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the morning, therefore, ye shall come near according to your tribes, and it shall be [that] the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families [thereof], and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households, and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it shall be [that] he that is taken in the anathema shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has because he has broken the covenant of the LORD and because he has wrought folly in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and bringing near the tribe of Judah, the family of the Zarhites was taken; and bringing near the family of the Zarhites man by man, Zabdi was taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he caused his household to come near, man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory now to the LORD God of Israel and give him praise; and tell me now what thou hast done; do not hide [it] from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them and took them; and, behold, they [are] hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, [it was] hid in his tent and the silver under it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto Joshua and unto all the sons of Israel and laid them out before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had, and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? The LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they raised over them a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
