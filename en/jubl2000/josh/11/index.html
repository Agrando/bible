thou shalt hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua came against them with all the people of war and fell upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them and chased them unto great Zidon and unto the hot springs and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them no one remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua did unto them as the LORD had commanded him; he hamstrung their horses and burnt their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua at that time returned and took Hazor and smote the king thereof with the sword because Hazor had been the head of all those kingdoms before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they smote all the souls that [were] in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying [them]; there was not any left to breathe; and he burnt Hazor with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Likewise, Joshua took all the cities of those kings and all their kings and smote them with the edge of the sword, [and] he utterly destroyed them as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But of all the cities that stood on their hills, Israel burned none of them, excepting Hazor only, which Joshua burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the spoil of these cities and the beasts, the sons of Israel took for themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, without leaving any that breathed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua took all that land, the mountains and all the [region] of the Negev and all the land of Goshen and the valleys and the plains and the mountain of Israel and its valleys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Even] from mount Halak that goes up unto Seir unto Baalgad in the plains of Lebanon at the roots of mount Hermon; likewise he took all their kings and smote them and slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joshua made war many days with all those kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was not a city that made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; they took all [the others] in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly [and] that they might have no mercy, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also at the same time Joshua came and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There were none of the Anakims left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
