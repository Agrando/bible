Therefore, the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal and celebrated the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they ate of the fruit of the land, unleavened cakes, on the next day after the passover and parched new ears [of grain] in the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna ceased on the next day after they had begun to eat of the fruit of the land; and the sons of Israel never had manna again; but they ate of the fruits of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joshua, being near Jericho, lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went unto him and said unto him, [Art] thou one of us or one of our adversaries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, No, but I [am] the Prince of the host of the LORD; now I am come. Then Joshua falling upon his face in the earth worshiped him and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Prince of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place on which thou dost stand [is] holy. And Joshua did so.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
