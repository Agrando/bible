And as I had not been sad before in his presence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>the king said unto me, Why [is] thy countenance sad, seeing thou [art] not sick? This [is] nothing [else] but brokenness of heart. Then I was very sore afraid</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said unto the king, Let the king live for ever; why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the house of my fathers' sepulchres, [lies] waste, and the its gates are consumed with fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, and if thy servant has found favour in thy sight, that thou would send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may rebuild it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? So the matter pleased the king, and he sent me; and I set him a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moreover, I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the captains on the other side of the river, that they may convey me over until I come into Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and a letter unto Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace of the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of the LORD upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I came to the captains of the other side of the river and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent princes of the army and horsemen with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Sanballat, the Horonite, and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither did I tell [any] man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; neither [was there any] beast with me, except the beast that I rode upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the fountain of the dragon and to the dung port and considered the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the its gates were consumed with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king's pool, but [there was] no place for the beast [that was] under me to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then went I up in the night by the brook and considered the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and [so] returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the rulers did not know where I had gone or what I had done; neither had I as yet told [it] to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we [are] in, how Jerusalem [lies] waste and its gates are burned with fire; come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no longer in reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then I told them how the hand of my God was good upon me and likewise the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they comforted their hands for good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when Sanballat, the Horonite, and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem, the Arabian, heard [it], they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then I gave them a reply and said unto them, The God of the heavens, he will prosper us; therefore, we, his servants, will arise and build; but ye have no portion nor righteousness, nor memorial in Jerusalem.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
