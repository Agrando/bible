And I set a great assembly against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren, the Jews who had been sold unto the Gentiles; and will ye even sell your brethren? And shall they be sold unto us? Then they remained silent, for they had nothing to answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also I said, What you do is not good, do you not walk in the fear of our God, that ye not be the reproach of our enemies the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I, likewise, [and] my brethren and my servants, have lent them money and grain; let us now release them from this burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Restore, I pray you, to them, today, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, and [even] the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they said, We will return [it] and will require nothing of them; so we will do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests and caused them to sware that they should do according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also I shook my lap and said, Thus will God shake out each man from his house and from his labour, that does not perform this promise, even thus shall he be shaken out and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover, from the day that I was appointed [by the king] to be their captain in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the captain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the former captains that [had been] before me had charged the people and had taken of them for bread and wine, upon forty shekels of silver; and in addition to this their servants bore rule over the people; but I did not do so because of the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In addition to this, I restored my part in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any inheritance; and all my servants [were] gathered together unto the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I also had at my table one hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came unto us from among the Gentiles that [are] around us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now [that] which was prepared for each day [was] one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and every ten days wine in all abundance; yet with all this I did not require the bread of the captain because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Remember me, my God, for good and all that I have done for this people.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
