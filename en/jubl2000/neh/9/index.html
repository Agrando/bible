So didst thou make thee a name, as [it is] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou didst throw into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover, thou didst lead them by day with a pillar of cloud and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light in the way by which they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou didst come down upon Mount Sinai and didst speak with them from heaven and didst give them right judgments and true laws, good statutes and commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and didst make known unto them the sabbath of thy holiness and didst prescribe for them commandments, statutes, and law by the hand of Moses, thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou didst give them bread from heaven in their hunger and didst bring forth water for them out of the rock in their thirst and didst promise them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and did not hearken unto thy commandments</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and refused to hear; neither did they remember thy wonders that thou hadst done among them, but hardened their necks and in their rebellion [thought] to appoint a leader to return to their bondage; but thou [art] a God of pardons, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great mercy, and for thou didst not leave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even when they had made themselves a molten calf and said, This [is] thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had committed great abominations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yet thou in thy manifold mercies didst not forsake them in the wilderness; the pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither did the pillar of fire by night, to illuminate the way in which they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou didst give thy good spirit to teach them and didst not withhold thy manna from their mouth and didst give them water for their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[Yea], forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness [so that] they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wax old, and their feet did not swell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou didst give them kingdoms and peoples and didst divide them into corners; so they possessed the land of Sihon and the land of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og, king of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thou didst multiply their sons as the stars of heaven and didst introduce them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to inherit [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the sons came in and possessed the land, and thou didst humble the inhabitants of the land before them, the Canaanites, and didst give them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took strong cities and fertile land and inherited houses full of all goods, hewn cisterns, vineyards and oliveyards and many trees of good fruit; so they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless, they were contentious and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, thou didst deliver them into the hand of their enemies, who afflicted them; and in the time of their tribulation, they cried unto thee, thou didst hear [them] from the heavens; and according to thy manifold mercies thou didst give them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore, thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned and cried unto thee, thou didst hear [them] from the heavens; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and didst protest unto them, that they return unto thy law; yet they dealt proudly and did not hearken unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments (which if a man shall do, in them he shall live) and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yet many years didst thou forbear them and didst protest against them with thy spirit by the hand of thy prophets; yet they did not hear; therefore, thou didst give them into the hand of the peoples of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Nevertheless, for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them; for thou [art] a gracious and merciful God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, therefore, our God, the great, mighty, and terrible God, who keeps covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, on our priests, on our prophets, on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Howbeit thou [art] just in all that has come upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, with which thou didst testify against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For they did not serve thee in their kingdom and in thy great goodness that thou didst give them and in the large and fat land which thou didst deliver before them; neither did they turn from their wicked works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Behold, we [are] servants this day, behold us here, servants in the land which thou didst give unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it multiplies its fruit for the kings, whom thou hast set over us because of our sins, who have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle, according to their will, and we [are] in great distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And because of all this, we make a sure [covenant] and write [it]; and our princes, Levites, [and] priests seal [unto it].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
