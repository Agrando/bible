But they had thought to do me evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I [am] doing a great work so that I cannot come down; why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort, and I answered them after the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Sanballat sent his servant to say the same thing for the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in which [was] written, It is reported among the Gentiles, and Gashmu saith [it], [that] thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou dost build the wall, that thou may be their king, according to these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, [There is] a king in Judah! And now these words shall be heard by the king. Come now, therefore, and let us take counsel together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou dost feign them out of thine own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it not be done. Now, therefore, [O God], strengthen my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Afterward I came in secret unto the house of Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who [was] shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they are coming to slay thee; yea, tonight they will come to slay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there as I who could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I perceived that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me, for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he was bribed to make me be thus afraid and sin and [that] they might have [matter] for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets, that [did things to] put me in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the wall was finished the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard [of it], all the Gentiles that [were] about us feared, and they were much cast down in their own eyes, and they knew that this work was wrought of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Likewise, in those days the principals of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For [there were] many in Judah sworn unto him, because he [was] the son-in-law of Shechaniah, the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They also reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
