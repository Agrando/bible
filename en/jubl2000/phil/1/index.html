notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, and will even rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this shall become my saving health through your prayer and the nourishment of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live [is] Christ and to die [is] gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour, yet I do not know what to choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I am in a strait between [the] two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>nevertheless, to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that your glorying in Jesus Christ may be more abundant by my coming to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your conversation be as is worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, unanimous, working together for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of saving health and that of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For unto you it is granted regarding Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear [to be] in me.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
