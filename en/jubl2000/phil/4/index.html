The Lord [is] near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Be anxious for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things [are] honest, whatever things [are] just, whatever things [are] pure, whatever things [are] lovely, whatever things [are] of good report, if [there is] any virtue and if [there is] any praise, exercise yourselves in these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those things, which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, do, and the God of peace shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again, in which ye were also concerned, but ye lacked opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know both how to be humbled, and I know how to have an abundance; in everything and by all things I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Notwithstanding ye have done well, that ye did communicate with my tribulation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I have all and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever.
