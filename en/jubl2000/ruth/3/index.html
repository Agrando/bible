Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore, thou shalt wash thyself and anoint thyself and put thy raiment upon thee and go down to the threshingfloor, [but] do not make thyself known unto the man until he shall have finished eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall be when he lies down that thou shalt perceive the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lie down [there], and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she said unto her, All that thou dost command me I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap, and she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass at midnight that the man was startled and took hold, and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he said, Who [art] thou? And she answered, I [am] Ruth, thy handmaid; spread therefore the edge [of thy mantle] over thy handmaid; for thou [art a] redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD, my daughter, [for] thou hast shown more mercy in the end than at the first, not going after the young men, whether poor or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do unto thee all that thou hast said, for all the city of my people know that thou [art] a valiant woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now it is true that I [am thy] redeemer; however, there is [another] redeemer nearer than I ([in kinship]).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning [that] if he will redeem thee, well, let him redeem thee, but if he does not wish to redeem, then I will redeem thee, [as] the LORD lives; lie down until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she lay at his feet until the morning, and she rose up before one could know another.
