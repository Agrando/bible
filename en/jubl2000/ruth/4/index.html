Come here and sit down. And he came and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, Sit down here. And they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said unto the redeemer, Naomi, that is come again out of the field of Moab, sold a parcel of land, which [was] our brother Elimelech's,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and I decided to cause thee to know this and tell thee to take [it] before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem [it], redeem [it], but if thou wilt not redeem [it], [then] tell me that I may know, for [there is] no one to redeem [it] besides thee, and I after thee. And he said, I will redeem [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Boaz replied, The day that thou dost receive the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must also receive Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the redeemer said, I cannot redeem [it] for myself lest I ruin my own inheritance; redeem thou; I cede my right to you, for I shall not be able to redeem [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now for a long time in Israel there had been this custom concerning redemption or contracts, that for the confirmation of all matters: one plucked off his shoe and gave [it] to his neighbour, and this [was] a testimony in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, [the former owner of] the right of redemption said unto Boaz, Buy [it] thyself. So he drew off his shoe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Boaz said unto the elders and [unto] all the people, Ye [are] witnesses this day that I have bought all that [was] Elimelech's and all that [was] Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover, I also take Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, as my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place. Ye [shall be] witnesses of this today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people that [were] in the gate and the elders, said, [We are] witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, who built the house of Israel; and be thou a man of valour in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife, and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed [be] the LORD, who has not left thee this day without a redeemer, whose name shall be famous in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he shall be unto thee a restorer of [thy] soul and a sustainer in thy old age, for thy daughter-in-law, whom thou doth love, who is better to thee than seven sons, has given birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and was his nurse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the women, her neighbours, named him, saying, There is a son born to Naomi, and they called his name Obed. This [is] the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now these [are] the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
