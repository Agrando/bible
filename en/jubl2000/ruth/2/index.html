And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and it came to pass that her lot was to light on a part of the field [belonging] unto Boaz, who [was] of the kindred of Elimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the reapers, The LORD [be] with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel [is] this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It [is] the damsel of Moab that came back with Naomi out of the fields of Moab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and she has said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came and has continued from the morning until now except a short while that [she] was in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hear, my daughter, do not glean in another field, nor leave here; thou shalt cleave to my maidens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Look carefully upon the field that they reap and go after them, for I have charged the young men not to touch thee. And when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels and drink of [that] which the young men have drawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes that thou should acknowledge me, seeing I [am] a stranger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Boaz answered and said unto her, It has fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband and [how] thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come three days ago unto a people whom thou didst not know not before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let the LORD recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to cover thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then she said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord, for thou hast comforted me and hast spoken unto the heart of thy handmaid though I am not like unto one of thy handmaidens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Boaz said unto her at mealtime, Come here and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and he gave her of the pottage, and she ate and was satisfied, and [some was] left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not reproach her</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and let fall also [some] of the handfuls on purpose for her and leave [them] that she may glean [them] and do not reprehend her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So she gleaned in the field until evening and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she took [it] up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also brought forth that which had been left over after she had been satisfied and gave it to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned today? Where hast thou worked? Blessed be he that acknowledged thee. And she declared unto her mother-in-law all that had happened to her with him and said, The man's name with whom I worked today [is] Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Let him be blessed of the LORD, who has not left off his mercy unto the living nor unto the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man [is] near of kin unto us, and of whom one has the right to redeem us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ruth, the Moabitess, said, He also said unto me, Thou shalt cleave to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Naomi replied unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, [It is] good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens that they not meet thee in any other field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So she kept close by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
