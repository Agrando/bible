for he that comes to God must believe that he is and [that] he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, having received revelation of things not seen as yet, with great care prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and was made heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham, being called, hearkened to go out into the place which he should afterwards receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he sojourned in the promised land, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in booths with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith also Sara herself [being sterile] received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she believed him to be faithful who had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore there sprang even of one, and him as good as dead, so [many] as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but seeing them afar off and believing [them] and embracing [them] and confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For those that say such things declare plainly that they seek their native country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from which they came out, they might have had time to have returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now they desire a better [country], that is, a heavenly one; therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from whence he also received him in a figure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning what they should become.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph, and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, as he died, made mention of the departing of the sons of Israel, and gave [a] commandment concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents because they saw [he was] a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of the blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land], which the Egyptians attempted to do [and] were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish together with the disobedient, having received the spies with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon and [of] Barak and [of] Samson and [of] Jephthae, [of] David also and Samuel and [of] the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who by faith won kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered from infirmities, were made valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of foreign [enemies];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>women received their dead raised to life again, and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and others experienced [cruel] mockings and scourgings, and added to this, bonds and imprisonment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>they were stoned; they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; poor, afflicted, mistreated,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>(of whom the world was not worthy); they wandered in deserts and [in] mountains and [in] dens and caves of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And these all, approved by testimony of faith, received not the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God having provided some better thing for us, that [they] without us should not be made perfect.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
