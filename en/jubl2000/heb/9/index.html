but now once in the consummation of the ages he has appeared to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as it is appointed unto men to die once, and after this the judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so also the Christ is offered once to take away the sins of many; and unto those that wait for him without sin he shall appear the second time unto saving health.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
