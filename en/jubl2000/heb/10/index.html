He took away the first, that he may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this will, we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus, the Christ, once [for all].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And so every priest stands daily ministering and offering many times the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but this [man], after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, is seated at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>waiting for that which follows, [that is], until his enemies are made his footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering he has perfected for ever those that are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Likewise the Holy Spirit gives us the same witness, who afterwards said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the testament that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will give my laws in their hearts, and in their souls will I write them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and [having] that great priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts purified from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>let us hold fast the profession of [our] hope without wavering (for he [is] faithful that promised).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let us consider one another to provoke unto charity and unto good works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking our gathering together, as the manner of some [is], but exhorting [one another] and so much the more, when ye see that day approaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful hope of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He that despised the law of Moses died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Of how much greater punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing and has done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know [who] he [is] that has said, Vengeance [belongs] to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But bring to memory the former days, in which, after ye received the light, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>on the one hand ye were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations, and on the other ye became companions of those that were so used.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing that in yourselves ye have a better substance in the heavens, and that abides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do not lose, therefore, this your confidence, which has great recompense of reward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for patience is necessary, so that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now the just shall live by faith, but if [any man] draws back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of those who draw back unto perdition, but faithful unto the saving of the soul.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
