Which, having begun to be published by the Lord, has been confirmed unto us by those that heard him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit, distributing them according to his own will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For unto the angels he has not subjected the world to come, of which we speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou dost visit him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou didst make him a little lower than the angels; thou didst crown him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we [do] not see yet that all things are put under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see this same Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was expedient that he, for whom [are] all things and by whom [are] all things, preparing to bring forth many sons in [his] glory, should perfect the author of their saving health through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both he that sanctifies and those who are sanctified [are] all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the empire of death, that is, the devil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For verily he did not take the angels, but he took the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore in all things he should be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in that he himself has suffered and was tempted, he is also powerful to help those that are tempted.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
