for what son is he whom the father does not chasten?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if ye are without chastisement, of which all [the sons] are partakers, then ye are bastards, and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected [us], and we gave [them] reverence; is it not much better to be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and we shall live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they verily for a few days chastened [us] as it seemed good unto them, but he for [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is true that no chastening at present seems to be [cause] for joy, but rather for grief; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto those who are exercised by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight steps unto your feet, so that which is lame will not turn out of the way, but let it rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow peace with everyone and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>looking diligently that no one deviate from the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up impede [you], and thereby many be defiled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest there [be] any fornicator or profane person as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For ye know how that afterward, desiring to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, which [voice] those that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(for they could not endure that which was commanded, and if so much as a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and so terrible was the sight [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but ye are come unto mount Sion and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the congregation of the church of the firstborn, who are registered in the heavens and to God the Judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus, the mediator of the new testament and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better than [that of] Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See that you do not refuse him that speaks. For if those who refused him that spoke on earth did not escape, much less [shall we escape], if we turn away from him that [speaks] from the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet even once, I shall shake not the earth only, but also the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this [word], Yet even once, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us hold fast to the grace, by which we serve God, pleasing him with reverence and godly fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for our God [is] a consuming fire.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
