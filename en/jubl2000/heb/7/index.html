first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>without father, without mother, without lineage, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God; abides a priest continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now consider how great this one [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And verily those that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they also have come out of the loins of Abraham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but he whose descent is not counted in those took tithes from Abraham and blessed him that had the promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And without any contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In the same manner, here men that die take tithes; but there he [received them], of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as I may so say, Levi also, who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec and not be called after the order of Aaron?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the priesthood being transposed, there is made of necessity a translation also of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no one presided [at] the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For [it is] manifest that our Lord sprang out of Juda, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it is yet far more manifest: if there arises another priest who is like unto Melchisedec,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who is not made according to the law of a carnal commandment, but by the virtue of an indissoluble life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the testimony is of this manner, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did], by which we draw near unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And [even more], inasmuch as it [is] not without an oath</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(for the others indeed without an oath were made priests, but this one with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord swore and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>by so much better testament is Jesus made surety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the others, truly, were many priests because they were not able to continue by reason of death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but this [man], because he continues forever, has the intransmissible priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he is able also to save to the uttermost those that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it was expedient that we have such a high priest, [who is] holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins and then for the people's; for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law makes men high priests who have weakness; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, has made perfect [a] Son forever.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
