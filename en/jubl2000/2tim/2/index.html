Strive not in words that profit nothing, [but rather] subvert the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that has nothing to be ashamed of, rightly dividing the word of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But avoid profane [and] vain wordiness, for it will develop into ungodliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And that word will eat away as gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past and [have] overthrown the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay, and likewise some to honour, and some to dishonour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If a man, therefore, purges himself from these things, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and profitable for the master's use, [and] prepared unto every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Flee also youthful lusts, but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But foolish and unwise questions refuse, knowing that they do beget contentions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That the servant of the Lord should not be contentious, but be meek unto everyone, apt to teach, patient,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that with meekness they might teach those that resist, if God peradventure will grant unto them that they might repent and know the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and [that] they may become converted out of the snare of the devil, in which they are captive to do his will.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
