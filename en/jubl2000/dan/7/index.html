So he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These great beasts, which are four, [are] four kings, [which] shall arise in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall take the kingdom of the Holy [One who is] most High and possess the kingdom until the age and until the age of the ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I had the desire to know the truth regarding the fourth beast, which was so different from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; [which] devoured and broke in pieces and trod down that which was left with its feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>also regarding the ten horns that [were] in its head, and [of] the other which came up, and before whom three fell; and that same horn had eyes and [a] mouth that spoke very grand things, whose appearance was greater than his fellows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I saw that this horn made war against the saints and overcame them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>until such time as the Elder of great age came, and the judgment was given unto the saints of the most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the Kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth king in earth, which shall be greater than all the other kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the ten horns [signify] that of this kingdom ten kings shall arise; and another shall rise after them; and he shall be greater than the first [kings], and he shall bring down three kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he shall speak [great] words against the most High and shall break down the saints of the most High and think to move the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until [a] time and times and the half [or dividing] of a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the Judge shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion to destroy and to cast out unto the end;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and that the kingdom and the dominion, and the majesty of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, be given to the holy people of the most High, His Kingdom [shall be] an eternal Kingdom, and all the dominions shall serve him and hear [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Up unto here was the end of the word. I, Daniel, was very troubled in my thoughts, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the word in my heart.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
