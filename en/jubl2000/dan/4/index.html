[Then] the king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, [let] the dream [be] to thine enemies, and its interpretation to those that wish thee evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree that thou didst see, which grew and made himself strong, whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whose leaves [were] fair and his fruit abundant and in him [was] food for all, under whom the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the fowls of the heaven dwelt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>it [is] thou, O king, that grew and made thyself strong; for thy greatness has grown and has reached unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And regarding that which the king saw, one who was a watchman and holy who came down from heaven and said, Hew the tree down and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and of brass [let it remain bound] in the green grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts of the field until seven times pass over him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>this [is] the interpretation, O king, and this [is] the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that they shall drive thee from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall feed thee with grass of the field as the oxen, and with the dew of heaven shalt thou be bathed, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt understand that the most High takes rule over the kingdom of men and that he shall give it to whoever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots in the earth; thy kingdom shall remain sure unto thee, that thou shalt understand that the rule [is] in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, O king, approve my counsel and redeem thy sins with righteousness and thine iniquities with mercies unto the poor: behold the medicine for thy sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months as he was walking upon the palace of the kingdom of Babylon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the king spoke and said, Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for [the] house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the glory of my greatness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The word was yet in the king's mouth when there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they drive thee from among men, and thy dwelling [shall be] with the beasts of the field; and they shall feed thee as the oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most High takes rule in the kingdom of men and gives it to whoever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from among men and ate grass as the oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like eagles' [feathers] and his nails like birds' [claws].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But at the end of the time I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding was returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and glorified him that lives for ever, whose dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom [is] through all ages:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and all the inhabitants of the earth [are] counted as nothing; and in the army of heaven and in the inhabitants of the earth, he does according to his will; nor is there anyone who can interfere with his hand and say unto him, What doest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>In the same time my reason was returned unto me, and I [turned] to the majesty of my kingdom; my dignity and greatness returned unto me; and my governors and my great [ones] sought me; and I was restored in my kingdom, and more [excellent] greatness was added unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and build up and glorify the King of heaven because all his works [are] truth, and his ways judgment: and he is able to humble those that walk with arrogance.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
