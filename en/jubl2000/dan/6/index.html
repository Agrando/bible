The king answered and said, The thing [is] true, according to the law of the Media and Persia, which does not change.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, which [is] of the sons of the captivity of the Jews, has not regarded thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast confirmed, but makes his petition three times a day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the king, heard the matter, it weighed very heavy upon him, and [he] set [his] heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured until the going down of the sun to deliver him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then those men assembled near the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that this is the law of Media and of Persia: No decree nor statute which the king has confirmed may be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast [him] into the den of lions.
