to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, [that are] near and [that are] far off through all the lands where thou hast driven them because of their rebellion with which they have rebelled against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O Lord, to us [belongs] confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Of the Lord our God is [the ability] to have mercy and to forgive, even though [we] have rebelled against him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and have not listened to the voice of the LORD our God to walk by his laws, which he set before us by the hand of his servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all Israel transposed thy law, departing by not hearing thy voice; by which the curse has fallen upon us and the oath that [is] written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke over us and over our judges that governed us, by bringing upon us such a great evil: that [such] has never been done under the whole heaven as has been done upon Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As [it is] written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us, and we never sought the face of the LORD our God, that we might be converted from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD hastened upon the chastisement and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God [is] just in all his works which he has done, for we did not listen to his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now, O Lord our God, who hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and hast won for thyself a very clear name as appears unto this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and all thy people is given in reproach to all [that are] about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is made desolate, by the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O my God, incline thine ear and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee [confiding] in our righteousnesses, but in thy many mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And whiles I [was] speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I [was] even yet speaking in prayer, and that man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, flying swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he caused me to understand and spoke with me and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to cause thee to understand the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the beginning of thy supplications, the word went forth, and I have come to teach it unto thee; for thou [art a man] greatly beloved: therefore understand the word, and understand the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the prevarication and to conclude the sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and seal the vision and the prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Know therefore and understand [that] from the going forth of the word to cause [the people] to return and to build Jerusalem unto the Anointed Prince, [there shall be] seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks, [while] the street shall be built again and the wall, [even] in troublous times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after the sixty-two weeks the Anointed [One] shall be killed and shall have nothing: (and the ruling people that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; whose end [shall be as] a flood, until at the end of the war it shall be cut off [with] desolation.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In one week (they are now seventy) he shall confirm the covenant by many: and at the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and because of the many abominations, desolation shall come, even until complete destruction shall be poured out upon the abominable [people].:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
