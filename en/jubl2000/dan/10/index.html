And as he was speaking this with me, I was trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst give thy heart to understand and to afflict thy soul before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come because of thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days: and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I am come to make thee know what shall befall thy people in the latter days, for there shall still [be] vision for [several] days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as he was speaking such words unto me, I looked toward the ground and became dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, [one] like the similitude of [the] son of man touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke and said unto him that stood before me, O my Lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how can the servant of my Lord talk with my Lord? for as for me, for in that instant I had no more strength in me, neither was there any breath left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then there came again and touched me [one] like the appearance of a man, and he comforted me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace [be] unto thee, be of good cheer, and be well. And as he spoke unto me, I was strengthened and said, Let my Lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said he, Knowest thou why I have come unto thee? Because now I must return to fight with the prince of the Persians; and when I am gone forth, next the prince of Grecia shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will interpret unto thee that which is written in the scripture of truth: and [there is] no one that holds with me in these [things], but Michael your prince.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
