The king spoke and said to the wise [men] of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing and show me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and [have] a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then all the king's wise [men] came in, but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king its interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then king Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his colour was changed, and his princes were upset.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[Now] the queen, by reason of the words of the king and of his princes, came into the banquet room. The queen spoke and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy [countenance] be pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom [lives] the spirit of the holy God; and in the days of thy father light and intelligence and wisdom, like the knowledge of God, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar, thy father, made prince over all the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, [and] fortune-tellers; [thus did] thy father, the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>because Daniel, whom the king named Beltechazzar, was found to have a more excellent spirit and greater knowledge and understanding interpreting dreams, unraveling questions, and dissolving doubts. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show [thee] the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Daniel was brought in before the king. [And] the king spoke and said unto Daniel, [Art] thou that Daniel, who [art] of the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom my father brought out of Judea?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the holy God is in thee and [that] light and understanding and greater wisdom was found in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now the wise [men], the astrologers, have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the thing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have heard of thee, that thou canst declare that which is in doubt and unravel difficulties: now if thou canst read this writing and show me its interpretation, thou shalt be clothed with purple and [have] a chain of gold about thy neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be for thyself and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king and show him the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the magnificence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and by the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him; whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he humbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when his heart made itself arrogant, and his spirit hardened itself in pride, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and they took his glory from him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he was driven from among the sons of men; and his heart was put with the beasts, and his dwelling [was] with the wild asses: they made him eat grass like an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until he understood that the most high God takes rule of the kingdom of men and [that] he appoints over it whoever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy princes, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; furthermore, thou hast praised gods of silver and of gold, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, which do not see, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand [is] thy soul and whose [are] all thy ways, thou hast never honoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then from his presence was sent the palm of the hand that sculpted this writing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the writing that he sculpted is, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This [is] the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God has audited thy kingdom and finished it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>PERES; Thy kingdom has been broken and is given to the Medes and Persians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple and [put] a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That same night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being sixty-two years old.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
