let all the inhabitants of the earth tremble for the day of the LORD comes, for [it is] near at hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of shadow that spreads itself upon the mountains as the dawn: a people great and strong; there has not ever been the like, neither shall [there] be any more after him, [even] to the years of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A fire devours before him and behind him a flame burns: the earth [is] as the garden of Eden before him, and behind him a desolate wilderness; neither shall anyone escape him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>His appearance [is] as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Like the thunder of chariots they shall leap over the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Before him the peoples shall fear: all faces shall go pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war, and they shall march each one in his ways, and they shall not break his ranks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>No one shall crowd his companion; they shall walk each one in his path: and [even] falling upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall go through the city; they shall run upon the wall; they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The earth shall quake before him; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall go dark; and the stars shall withdraw their shining:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for many are his camps and strong, that execute his word; for the day of the LORD [is] great, and very terrible; and who can abide it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn unto me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping, and with mourning:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God for he [is] gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in mercy, and he does repent of chastisement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who knows [if] he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him [even] a present and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blow the shofar in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>gather the people, sanctify the meeting, assemble the elders, gather the children and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Forgive thy people, O LORD, and do not give thine heritage to reproach that the Gentiles should rule over her: why should they say among the peoples, Where [is] their God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the LORD will be jealous for his earth and forgive his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you bread and new wine and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no longer make you a reproach among the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I will remove far off from you he of the north [wind] and will drive him into a land barren and desolate; his face shall be toward the east sea, and his end unto the western sea, and he shall exhale his foul odour, and he shall decompose, because he has lifted himself up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD has done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Be not afraid, ye animals of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness shall become green again, for the trees shall bear their fruit, the fig tree and the vine shall give their fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ye also, sons of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the LORD your God for he has given you the former rain according to righteousness, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain [as] in the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will restore to you the years that the caterpillar has eaten, the locust, and the cankerworm, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God that has dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never again be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And ye shall know that I [am] in the midst of Israel and [that] I [am] the LORD your God, and [there is] none other; and my people shall never be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall come to pass after this [that] I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and even upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will show wonders in the heaven and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and the terrible day of the LORD comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it shall come to pass [that] whoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall escape: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the LORD has said, and in those who are left, to whom the LORD shall have called.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
