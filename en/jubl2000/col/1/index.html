name="1">1</a>Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the charity [which ye have] toward all the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which ye have already heard by the word of the truth of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>which is come unto you, as [it is] in all the world, and brings forth fruit, as [it does] also in you, since the day ye heard [it] and knew the grace of God in truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>as ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>who also declared unto us your charity in [the] Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray for you, asking that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that ye might walk worthy of the Lord, pleasing [him] in everything, being fruitful in every good work, and growing in the knowledge of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>strengthened with all might, according to the power of his glory unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>giving thanks unto the Father, who has made us worthy to participate in the inheritance of the saints in light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the remission of sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for by him were all things created, that [are] in the heavens and that [are] in earth, visible and invisible, whether [they are] thrones or dominions or principalities or powers: all things were created by him and in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all [things] he might have the preeminence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all fullness dwell</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and by him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his stake, whether [they are] the things in the earth or the things in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you, that were in another time alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now he has reconciled [you]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable and unreproveable in his sight</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and [are] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard [and] which is preached to every creature which is under heaven, of which I Paul am made a minister,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fulfill in my flesh that which [is] lacking of the tribulations of the Christ for his body's sake, which is the church,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>of which I am made a minister by the dispensation of God which is given to me in you, to fulfil the word of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[even] the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to whom God would make known what [is] the riches of the glory of this mystery in the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>whom we preach, warning every man and teaching in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In which I continue to labour, contending according to his operation, which he works in me mightily.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
