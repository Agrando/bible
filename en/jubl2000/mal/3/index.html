Return unto me, and I will return unto you, said the LORD of the hosts. But ye said, In what shall we return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, In what have we robbed thee? In the tithes and the offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ye [are] cursed with a curse: for ye, even this whole nation, have robbed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, and there shall be food in my house, and prove me now in this, said the LORD of the hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that [there shall] not [be room] enough [to receive it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will reprehend the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of the ground; neither shall the vine in the field abort, said the LORD of the hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the Gentiles shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, said the LORD of the hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your words have prevailed against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye have said, It [is] vain to serve God, and what profit [is it] that we have kept his law and that we walk mournfully before the LORD of the hosts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We say, therefore, now, that blessed are the proud and even that those that work wickedness are prospered; [those that] tempted God have escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then those that feared the LORD spoke one to another, and the LORD hearkened and heard [it], and a book of remembrance was written before him for those that feared the LORD and for those that think in his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they shall be mine, said the LORD of the hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore become ye converted, and ye shall make a difference between the just and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that did not serve him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
