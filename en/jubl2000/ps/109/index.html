they have spoken of me with a lying tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They compassed me about with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They have [responded] to my love by becoming my adversaries, but I [give myself unto] prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set thou the wicked man over him, and let Satan stand at his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he shall be judged, let him be condemned, and let his prayer become sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let his days be few, [and] let another take his office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let his children be continually vagabonds and beg; let them seek [their bread] out of their desolate places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the extortioner catch all that he has, and let the strangers spoil his labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let there be no one to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let his posterity be cut off, [and] in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because he did not remember to show mercy but persecuted the man who is poor [in spirit] and destitute and broken in heart, that he might slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As he loved the curse, so let it come unto him; as he delighted not in the blessing, so let it be far from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As he clothed himself with the curse like as with his garment, and it entered into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let it be unto him as the garment [which] covers him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[Let] this [be] the reward from the LORD of those who spoke falsely against me and of those that speak evil against my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou, O GOD the Lord, do unto me for thy name's sake; because thy mercy [is] good, deliver me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I [am] poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am gone like the shadow when it declines; I am tossed up and down [by the wind] as the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh fails for lack of fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have become a reproach unto them; [when] they looked upon me they shook their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Help me, O LORD my God; O save me according to thy mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they may know that this [is] thy hand, [that] thou, O LORD, hast done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them curse, but bless thou; when they arise, let them be ashamed, but let thy servant rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let those who speak evil against me falsely be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; [yea], I will praise him among the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor [in spirit] to save his soul from those that judge him.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
