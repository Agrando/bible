O give thanks unto the LORD, for [he is] good, for his mercy [endures] for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? [Who] can show forth all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Happy [are] those that keep judgment [and] he that does righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour [that thou dost bear unto] thy people; O visit me with thy saving health,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers did not understand thy wonders in Egypt; they did not remember the multitude of thy mercies but rebelled by the sea, [even] at the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He reprehended the Red sea also, and it was dried up, so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated [them] and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They became rash. They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They gave themselves over to lust in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then they envied Moses in the camp [and] Aaron the saint of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb and worshipped the molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot the God of their saving health, who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>wondrous works in the land of Ham, [and] terrible things upon the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But murmured in their tents [and] did not hearken unto the voice of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to overthrow their seed also among the Gentiles, and to scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They also joined themselves unto Baalpeor and ate the sacrifices for the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus they provoked [him] to anger with their inventions; and the plague broke in upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment, and [so] the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And that was counted unto him for righteousness from generation to generation for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered [him] also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because they provoked his spirit to rebel, and he spoke it with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But were mingled among the Gentiles and learned their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they served their idols, which were a snare unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>[Yea], they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and shed innocent blood, [even] the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus they were defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave them into the hand of the Gentiles, and those that hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He delivered them many times, but they rebelled at his counsel and were brought low for their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless he would look upon their affliction and hear their cry</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and remember his covenant with them and repent according to the multitude of his mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He also caused those that carried them captives to have mercy upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the Gentiles, that we might lift up thy holy name, that we might glory in thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting; and let all the people say, Amen.
