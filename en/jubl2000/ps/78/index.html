But while their food [was] yet in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the wrath of God came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they sinned still and did not give him credit for his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity and their years in tribulation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned and enquired early after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God [was] their rock and the high God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, [being] full of compassion, forgave [their] iniquity and did not destroy [them]; many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For he remembered that they [were but] flesh: a wind that passes away and does not come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often did they provoke him in the wilderness [and] grieve him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They did not remember his hand, [nor] the day when he ransomed them from anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Zoan</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods, that they could not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent swarms [of flies] among them, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He gave also their fruits unto the caterpillar and their works unto the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail and their [wild] fig trees with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to [thunderbolts of] fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation and trouble by sending evil angels [among them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a way to his anger; he did not spare their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of [their] strength in the tents of Ham:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he brought them into the borders of his holiness, into this mountain, [which] his right hand had purchased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He cast out the Gentiles also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God and did not keep his testimonies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But turned back and rebelled like their fathers; they became like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>God heard [this] and was wroth and greatly abhorred Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>For this reason he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent [in which] he dwelt among men</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemy's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The fire consumed their young men; and their virgins were not honored [in marriage] songs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep [and] like a mighty man that shouts [by reason] of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts; he put them to a perpetual reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he built his sanctuary in preeminence like the earth which he has established for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He chose David also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>from following the ewes great with young, he brought him to feed Jacob his people and Israel his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he fed them out of the integrity of his heart and guided them by the intelligence of his hands.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
