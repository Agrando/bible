for the waters are come in unto [my] soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I sink in deep mire where [there is] no standing; I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; my eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; those that would destroy me, [being] my enemies wrongfully, are mighty; then I restored [that] which I did not take away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, thou knowest my foolishness, and my guiltiness is not hid from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not let those that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of the hosts, be ashamed for my sake; do not let those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame has covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the zeal of thy house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When I wept with fasting of my soul, thou hast been a reproach unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a proverb to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They that sat in the gate spoke against me, and I [was] the song of the drunkards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I [corrected] my prayer unto thee, O LORD, [in] the time of [thy] good pleasure; O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy saving health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not drown; let me be delivered from those that hate me and out of the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not the violent force of the waters overcome me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hear me, O LORD, for thy mercy [is] perceptible, look upon me according to the multitude of thy acts of compassion</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble; hear me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw near unto my soul [and] redeem it; deliver me because of my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour; my adversaries [are] all before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness, and I looked [for some] to take pity, but [there was] no one, and for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They also gave me gall for my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let their table become a snare before them, and [that which should have been] for [their] prosperity, [let it become] a stumbling block.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let their palace be desolate, [and] let no one dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they persecute [him] whom thou hast smitten, and they boast that thou hast slain their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I [am] poor and sorrowful; let thy saving health, O God, set me up on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify him with praises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[This] also shall please the LORD better [than the sacrifice of an ox or] bullock that [struggles] with horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The humble shall see [this] [and] be glad; seek God and thy heart shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the LORD hears the destitute and does not despise his prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let the heavens and the earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moves in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will protect Zion and will rebuild the cities of Judah; they shall dwell there and inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The seed of his servants shall inherit it, and those that love his name shall dwell therein.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
