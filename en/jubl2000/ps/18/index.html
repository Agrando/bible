my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, [and] my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised, so shall I be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The pain of death compassed me, and the rivers of Belial made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The pain of Sheol compassed me about: the snares of death came before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In my distress I called upon the LORD and cried unto my God; he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, [even] into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains collapsed and were removed because he was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Smoke went up out of his nostrils, and fire devoured out of his mouth; coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He lowered the heavens and came down; and darkness [was] under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he rode upon a cherub and flew: yea, he flew upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness his hiding place; in his tabernacle round about him [were] dark waters [and] thick clouds of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At the brightness [that was] before him his thick clouds passed, hail [stones] and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail [stones] and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He sent out his arrows and scattered them; he shot out lightnings and destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the depths of the waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me, even though they were too strong for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They were ready for me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He brought me forth also into a wide place; he delivered me because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The LORD will reward me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he shall recompense me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because I have kept the ways of the LORD and did not become wicked [departing] in apostasy from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all his judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was perfect before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with a perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore thou wilt save the humble people; but wilt bring down high looks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thou wilt light my fire: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For with thee I have scattered armies; and in my God I have overcome walled [defences].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>[As for] God, his way [is] perfect: the word of the LORD is precise: a shield to all those that wait in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who [is] God except the LORD? or who [is] a refuge except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>[It is] God that girds me with strength and makes my way perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He makes my feet like hinds' [feet] and sets me upon my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He trains my hands for the battle, so that a bow of bronze shall be broken by my arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>[In the same manner] thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand will hold me up, and thy meekness shall multiply me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou shall enlarge my steps under me, and my knees shall not tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I shall pursue my enemies and overtake them: neither shall I turn again until they are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I shall smite them, and they will not be able to rise: they shall fall under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued my enemies under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies that I might destroy those that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They cried out, but [there was] no one to save [them]: [even] unto the LORD, but he did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then I beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I scattered them as the dirt in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; [and] thou hast made me the head of the Gentiles: a people [whom] I did not know served me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me: the sons of strangers submitted themselves unto me even [against their will].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The strangers fell away and were afraid in their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The LORD lives; and blessed [be] my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>[It is] God that avenges me and subdues the peoples under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He delivers me from my enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the one who would betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the Gentiles and sing praises unto thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He gives great deliverance to his king and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
