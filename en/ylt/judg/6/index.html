and where [are] all His  wonders which our fathers recounted to us, saying, Hath not  Jehovah brought us up out of Egypt? and now Jehovah hath left  us, and doth give us into the hand of Midian.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah turneth unto him and saith, `Go in this -- thy  power; and thou hast saved Israel out of the hand of  Midian -- have not I sent thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he saith unto him, `O, my lord, wherewith do I save  Israel? lo, my chief [is] weak in Manasseh, and I the least in  the house of my father.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah saith unto him, `Because I am with thee -- thou  hast smitten the Midianites as one man.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he saith unto Him, `If, I pray Thee, I have found grace  in Thine eyes, then Thou hast done for me a sign that Thou art  speaking with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Move not, I pray Thee, from this, till my coming in unto  Thee, and I have brought out my present, and put it before  Thee;` and he saith, `I -- I do abide till thy return.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Gideon hath gone in, and prepareth a kid of the goats,  and of an ephah of flour unleavened things; the flesh he hath  put in a basket, and the broth he hath put in a pot, and he  bringeth out unto Him, unto the place of the oak, and bringeth  [it] nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the messenger of God saith unto him, `Take the flesh  and the unleavened things, and place on this rock -- and the  broth pour out;` and he doth so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the messenger of Jehovah putteth forth the end of the  staff which [is] in His hand, and cometh against the flesh, and  against the unleavened things, and the fire goeth up out of the  rock and consumeth the flesh and the unleavened things -- and the  messenger of Jehovah hath gone from his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Gideon seeth that He [is] a messenger of Jehovah, and  Gideon saith, `Alas, Lord Jehovah! because that I have seen a  messenger of Jehovah face to face!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah saith to him, `Peace to thee; fear not; thou  dost not die.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon buildeth there an altar to Jehovah, and calleth  it Jehovah-Shalom, unto this day it [is] yet in Ophrah of the  Abi-Ezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it cometh to pass, on that night, that Jehovah saith to  him, `Take the young ox which [is] to thy father, and the  second bullock of seven years, and thou hast thrown down the  altar of Baal which [is] to thy father, and the shrine which  [is] by it thou dost cut down,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and thou hast built an altar to Jehovah thy God on the top  of this stronghold, by the arrangement, and hast taken the  second bullock, and caused to ascend a burnt-offering with the  wood of the shrine which thou cuttest down.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Gideon taketh ten men of his servants, and doth as  Jehovah hath spoken unto him, and it cometh to pass, because he  hath been afraid of the house of his father, and the men of the  city, to do [it] by day, that he doth [it] by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the men of the city rise early in the morning, and lo,  broken down hath been the altar of Baal, and the shrine which  is by it hath been cut down, and the second bullock hath been  offered on the altar which is built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they say one to another, `Who hath done this thing?`  and they inquire and seek, and they say, `Gideon son of Joash  hath done this thing.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the men of the city say unto Joash, `Bring out thy son,  and he dieth, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal,  and because he hath cut down the shrine which [is] by it.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joash saith to all who have stood against him, `Ye, do  ye plead for Baal? ye -- do ye save him? he who pleadeth for him  is put to death during the morning; if he [is] a god he himself  doth plead against him, because he hath broken down his altar.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he calleth him, on that day, Jerubbaal, saying, `The  Baal doth plead against him, because he hath broken down his  altar.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east have  been gathered together, and pass over, and encamp in the valley  of Jezreel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and the Spirit of Jehovah hath clothed Gideon, and he  bloweth with a trumpet, and Abi-Ezer is called after him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and messengers he hath sent into all Manasseh, and it also  is called after him; and messengers he hath sent into Asher,  and into Zebulun, and into Naphtali, and they come up to meet  them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Gideon saith unto God, `If Thou art Saviour of Israel  by my hand, as Thou hast spoken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>lo, I am placing the fleece of wool in the threshing-floor:  if dew is on the fleece alone, and on all the earth  drought -- then I have known that Thou dost save Israel by my  hand, as Thou hast spoken;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and it is so, and he riseth early on the morrow, and  presseth the fleece, and wringeth dew out of the fleece -- the  fulness of the bowl, of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gideon saith unto God, `Let not Thine anger burn  against me, and I speak only this time; let me try, I pray  Thee, only this time with the fleece -- let there be, I pray  Thee, drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth let  there be dew.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And God doth so on that night, and there is drought on the  fleece alone, and on all the earth there hath been dew.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
