and ye -- ye  make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land -- their  altars ye break down; and ye have not hearkened to My  voice -- what [is] this ye have done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I also have said, I do not cast them out from your  presence, and they have been to you for adversaries, and their  gods are to you for a snare.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it cometh to pass, when the messenger of Jehovah  speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel, that the  people lift up their voice and weep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they call the name of that place Bochim, and sacrifice  there to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua sendeth the people away, and the sons of Israel  go, each to his inheritance, to possess the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the people serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all  the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, who saw  all the great work of Jehovah which He did to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Jehovah, dieth, a son of a  hundred and ten years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in  Timnath-Heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of  mount Gaash;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and also all that generation have been gathered unto their  fathers, and another generation riseth after them who have not  known Jehovah, and even the work which He hath done to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of  Jehovah, and serve the Baalim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and forsake Jehovah, God of their fathers, who bringeth  them out from the land of Egypt, and go after other gods (of  the gods of the peoples who [are] round about them), and bow  themselves to them, and provoke Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>yea, they forsake Jehovah, and do service to Baal and to  Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He  giveth them into the hand of spoilers, and they spoil them, and  He selleth them into the hand of their enemies round about, and  they have not been able any more to stand before their enemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>in every [place] where they have gone out, the hand of  Jehovah hath been against them for evil, as Jehovah hath  spoken, and as Jehovah hath sworn to them, and they are  distressed -- greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah raiseth up judges, and they save them from the  hand of their spoilers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and also unto their judges they have not hearkened, but  have gone a-whoring after other gods, and bow themselves to  them; they have turned aside [with] haste out of the way [in]  which their fathers walked to obey the commands of  Jehovah -- they have not done so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Jehovah raised up to them judges -- then was Jehovah  with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies  all the days of the judge; for it repenteth Jehovah, because of  their groaning from the presence of their oppressors, and of  those thrusting them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it hath come to pass, at the death of the judge -- they  turn back and have done corruptly above their fathers, to go  after other gods, to serve them, and to bow themselves to them;  they have not fallen from their doings, and from their stiff  way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the anger of Jehovah doth burn against Israel, and He  saith, `Because that this nation have transgressed My covenant  which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to My  voice --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I also continue not to dispossess any from before them of  the nations which Joshua hath left when he dieth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>in order to try Israel by them, whether they are keeping  the way of Jehovah, to go in it, as their fathers kept [it] or  not.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah leaveth these nations, so as not to dispossess  them hastily, and did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
