and  what art thou doing in this [place?] and what to thee here?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he saith unto them, `Thus and thus hath Micah done to  me; and he hireth me, and I am to him for a priest.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they say to him, `Ask, we pray thee, at God, and we  know whether our way is prosperous on which we are going.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest saith to them, `Go in peace; over-against  Jehovah [is] your way in which ye go.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the five men go, and come in to Laish, and see the  people which [is] in its midst, dwelling confidently, according  to the custom of Zidonians, quiet and confident; and there is  none putting to shame in the land in [any] thing, possessing  restraint, and they [are] far off from the Zidonians, and have  no word with [any] man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they come in unto their brethren, at Zorah and Eshtaol,  and their brethren say to them, `What -- ye?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they say, `Rise, and we go up against them, for we have  seen the land, and lo, very good; and ye are keeping silent! be  not slothful to go -- to enter to possess the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When ye go, ye come in unto a people confident, and the  land [is] large on both hands, for God hath given it into your  hand, a place where there is no lack of anything which [is] in  the land.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there journey thence, of the family of the Danite,  from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with  weapons of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they go up and encamp in Kirjath-Jearim, in Judah,  therefore they have called that place, `Camp of Dan,` till this  day; lo, behind Kirjath-Jearim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they pass over thence [to] the hill-country of  Ephraim, and come in unto the house of Micah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the five men, those going to traverse the land of  Laish, answer and say unto their brethren, `Have ye known that  there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and graven  image, and molten image? and now, know what ye do.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they turn aside thither, and come in unto the house of  the young man the Levite, the house of Micah, and ask of him of  welfare, --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(and the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war,  who [are] of the sons of Dan, are standing at the opening of  the gate), --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yea, the five men, those going to traverse the land, go  up -- they have come in thither -- they have taken the graven image,  and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image -- and the  priest is standing at the opening of the gate, and the six  hundred men who are girded with weapons of war --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>yea, these have entered the house of Micah, and take the  graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten  image; and the priest saith unto them, `What are ye doing?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and they say to him, `Keep silent, lay thy hand on thy  mouth, and go with us, and be to us for a father and for a  priest: is it better thy being a priest to the house of one  man, or thy being priest to a tribe and to a family in Israel?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the heart of the priest is glad, and he taketh the  ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and goeth into  the midst of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they turn and go, and put the infants, and the cattle,  and the baggage, before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They have been far off from the house of Micah -- and the  men who [are] in the houses which [are] near the house of Micah  have been called together, and overtake the sons of Dan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and call unto the sons of Dan, and they turn round their  faces, and say to Micah, `What -- to thee that thou hast been  called together?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he saith, `My gods which I made ye have taken, and the  priest, and ye go; and what to me more? and what [is] this ye  say unto me, What -- to thee!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the sons of Dan say unto him, `Let not thy voice be  heard with us, lest men bitter in soul fall upon you, and thou  hast gathered thy life, and the life of thy household;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the sons of Dan go on their way, and Micah seeth that  they are stronger than he, and turneth, and goeth back unto his  house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they have taken that which Micah had made, and the  priest whom he had, and come in against Laish, against a people  quiet and confident, and smite them by the mouth of the sword,  and the city have burnt with fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and there is no deliverer, for it [is] far off from Zidon,  and they have no word with [any] man, and it [is] in the valley  which [is] by Beth-Rehob; and they build the city, and dwell in  it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and call the name of the city Dan, by the name of Dan  their father, who was born to Israel; and yet Laish [is] the  name of the city at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the sons of Dan raise up for themselves the graven  image, and Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, he and his  sons have been priests to the tribe of the Danite, till the day  of the removal of [the people] of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they appoint for them the graven image of Micah, which  he had made, all the days of the house of God being in Shiloh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
