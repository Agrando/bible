and what have I been able to do like you?` Then their  temper desisted from off him in his speaking this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Gideon cometh in unto the Jordan, passing over, he and  the three hundred men who [are] with him -- wearied, and  pursuing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and he saith to the men of Succoth, `Give, I pray you, cakes  of bread to the people who [are] at my feet, for they [are]  wearied, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna kings of  Midian.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the heads of Succoth say, `Is the hand of Zebah and  Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we give to thy host bread?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Gideon saith, `Therefore -- in Jehovah`s giving Zebah and  Zalmunna into my hand -- I have threshed your flesh with the  thorns of the wilderness, and with the threshing instruments.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he goeth up thence [to] Penuel, and speaketh unto them  thus; and the men of Penuel answer him as the men of Succoth  answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he speaketh also to the men of Penuel, saying, `In my  turning back in peace, I break down this tower.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Zebah and Zalmunna [are] in Karkor, and their camps  with them, about fifteen thousand, all who are left of all the  camp of the sons of the east; and those falling [are] a hundred  and twenty thousand men, drawing sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Gideon goeth up the way of those who tabernacle in  tents, on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smiteth the camp,  and the camp was confident;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and Zebab and Zalmunna flee, and he pursueth after them,  and captureth the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and  all the camp he hath caused to tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Gideon son of Joash turneth back from the battle, at  the going up of the sun,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and captureth a young man of the men of Succoth, and asketh  him, and he describeth unto him the heads of Succoth, and its  elders -- seventy and seven men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he cometh in unto the men of Succoth, and saith, `Lo  Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye reproached me, saying, Is the  hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we give to thy  men who [are] wearied bread?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he taketh the elders of the city, and the thorns of the  wilderness, and the threshing instruments, and teacheth by them  the men of Succoth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the tower of Penuel he hath broken down, and slayeth  the men of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he saith unto Zebah and unto Zalmunna, `How -- the men  whom ye slew in Tabor?` and they say, `As thou -- so they, one -- as  the form of the king`s sons.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he saith, `My brethren -- sons of my mother -- they;  Jehovah liveth, if ye had kept them alive -- I had not slain  you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he saith to Jether his first-born, `Rise, slay them;`  and the young man hath not drawn his sword, for he hath been  afraid, for he [is] yet a youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Zebah saith -- also Zalmunna -- `Rise thou, and fall upon  us; for as the man -- his might;` and Gideon riseth, and slayeth  Zebah and Zalmunna, and taketh their round ornaments which [are]  on the necks of their camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the men of Israel say unto Gideon, `Rule over us, both  thou, and thy son, and thy son`s son, for thou hast saved us  from the hand of Midian.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Gideon saith unto them, `I do not rule over you, nor  doth my son rule over you; Jehovah doth rule over you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon saith unto them, `Let me ask of you a petition,  and give ye to me each the ring of his prey, for they have  rings of gold, for they [are] Ishmaelites.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they say, `We certainly give;` and they spread out the  garment, and cast thither each the ring of his prey;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the weight of the rings of gold which he asked is a  thousand and seven hundred [shekels] of gold, apart from the  round ornaments, and the drops, and the purple garments, which  [are] on the kings of Midian, and apart from the chains which  [are] on the necks of their camels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and Gideon maketh it into an ephod, and setteth it up in  his city, in Ophrah, and all Israel go a-whoring after it  there, and it is to Gideon and to his house for a snare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Midian is humbled before the sons of Israel, and have  not added to lift up their head; and the land resteth forty  years in the days of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jerubbaal son of Joash goeth and dwelleth in his own  house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and to Gideon there have been seventy sons, coming out of  his loin, for he had many wives;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and his concubine, who [is] in Shechem, hath born to  him -- even she -- a son, and he appointeth his name Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Gideon son of Joash dieth, in a good old age, and is  buried in the burying-place of Joash his father, in Ophrah of  the Abi-Ezrite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it cometh to pass, when Gideon [is] dead, that the sons  of Israel turn back and go a-whoring after the Baalim, and set  over them Baal-Berith for a god;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and the sons of Israel have not remembered Jehovah their  God, who is delivering them out of the hand of all their  enemies round about,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>neither have they done kindness with the house of  Jerubbaal -- Gideon -- according to all the good which he did with  Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
