An avenger [is] Jehovah on His  adversaries, And He is watching for His enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah [is] slow to anger, and great in power, And Jehovah  doth not entirely acquit, In a hurricane and in a tempest [is]  His way, And a cloud [is] the dust of His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He is pushing against a sea, and drieth it up, Yea, all the  floods He hath made dry, Languishing [are] Bashan and Carmel,  Yea, the flower of Lebanon [is] languishing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Mountains have shaken because of Him, And the hills have  been melted; And lifted up [is] the earth at His presence, And  the world and all dwelling in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Before His indignation who doth stand? And who riseth up in  the heat of His anger? His fury hath been poured out like fire,  And the rocks have been broken by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Good [is] Jehovah for a strong place in a day of distress.  And He knoweth those trusting in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And with a flood passing over, An end He maketh of its  place, And His enemies doth darkness pursue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What do we devise against Jehovah?
