And [be] ready  always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account  concerning the hope that [is] in you, with meekness and fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>having a good conscience, that in that in which they speak  against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who are  traducing your good behaviour in Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for [it is] better doing good, if the will of God will it,  to suffer, than doing evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous  for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God, having been  put to death indeed, in the flesh, and having been made alive  in the spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did  preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who sometime disbelieved, when once the long-suffering of  God did wait, in days of Noah -- an ark being preparing -- in  which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>also to which an antitype doth now save us -- baptism, (not  a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a  good conscience in regard to God,) through the rising again of  Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to heaven  -- messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been  subjected to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
