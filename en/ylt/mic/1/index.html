Attend, O earth, and its  fulness, And the Lord Jehovah is against you for a witness, The  Lord from His holy temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For lo, Jehovah is going out from His place, And He hath  come down, And hath trodden on high places of earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Melted have been the mountains under Him, And the valleys do  rend themselves, As wax from the presence of fire, As waters  cast down by a slope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the transgression of Jacob [is] all this, And for the  sins of the house of Israel. What [is] the transgression of  Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what the high places of Judah? Is  it not Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I have set Samaria for a heap of the field, For  plantations of a vineyard, And poured out into a valley her  stones, And her foundations I uncover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all her graven images are beaten down, And all her gifts  are burnt with fire, And all her idols I make a desolation,  For, from the hire of a harlot she gathered, and unto the hire  of a harlot they return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this I lament and howl, I go spoiled and naked, I make a  lamentation like dragons, And a mourning like daughters of an  ostrich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For mortal [are] her wounds, For it hath come unto Judah, It  hath come to a gate of My people -- to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In Gath tell ye not -- in Acco weep not, In Beth-Aphrah, in  dust roll thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pass over for thee, O inhabitant of Shaphir, Naked one of  shame. Not gone out hath the inhabitant of Zaanan, The  lamentation of Beth-Ezel doth take from you its standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For stayed for good hath the inhabitant of Maroth, For evil  hath come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bind the chariot to a swift beast, O inhabitant of Lachish,  The beginning of sin [is] she to the daughter of Zion, For in  thee have been found the transgressions of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore thou givest presents to Moresheth-Gath, The  houses of Achzib become a lying thing to the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet the possessor I do bring in to thee, O inhabitant of  Mareshah, To Adullam come in doth the honour of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make bald and shave, for thy delightful sons, Enlarge thy  baldness as an eagle, For they have removed from thee!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
