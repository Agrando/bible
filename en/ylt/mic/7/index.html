Now is their perplexity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Believe not in a friend, trust not in a leader, From her who  is lying in thy bosom keep the openings of thy mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For a son is dishonouring a father, A daughter hath stood  against her mother, A daughter-in-law against her  mother-in-law, The enemies of each [are] the men of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I -- in Jehovah I do watch, I do wait for the God of my  salvation, Hear me doth my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thou dost not rejoice over me, O mine enemy, When I have  fallen, I have risen, When I sit in darkness Jehovah is a light  to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The indignation of Jehovah I do bear, For I have sinned  against Him, Till that He doth plead my cause, And hath  executed my judgment, He doth bring me forth to the light, I  look on His righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And see doth mine enemy, And cover her doth shame, Who  saith unto me, `Where [is] Jehovah thy God?` Mine eyes do look  on her, Now she is for a treading-place, As mire of the  out-places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The day to build thy walls! That day -- removed is the  limit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>That day -- even unto thee it doth come in, From Asshur and  the cities of the fortress, And from the fortress even unto the  river, And from sea to sea, and mount to mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the land hath been for a desolation, Because of its  inhabitants, Because of the fruit of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Rule Thou Thy people with Thy rod, The flock of Thine  inheritance, Dwelling alone [in] a forest in the midst of  Carmel, They enjoy Bashan and Gilead as in days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to the days of thy coming forth out of the land  of Egypt, I do shew it wonderful things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>See do nations, and they are ashamed of all their might,  They lay a hand on the mouth, their ears are deaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They lick dust as a serpent, as fearful things of earth,  They tremble from their enclosures, Of Jehovah our God they are  afraid, Yea, they are afraid of Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who [is] a God like Thee? taking away iniquity, And passing  by the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance, He hath  not retained for ever His anger, Because He -- He delighteth  [in] kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He doth turn back, He pitieth us, He doth subdue our  iniquities, And Thou castest into the depths of the sea all  their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou givest truth to Jacob, kindness to Abraham, That thou  hast sworn to our fathers, from the days of antiquity!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
