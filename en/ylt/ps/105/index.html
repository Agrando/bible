call ye in His name, Make  known among the peoples His acts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sing ye to Him -- sing praise to Him, Meditate ye on all  His wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, The heart of those  seeking Jehovah rejoiceth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek ye His face  continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember His wonders that He did, His signs and the  judgments of His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His  chosen ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He [is] Jehovah our God, In all the earth [are] His  judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He hath remembered to the age His covenant, The word He  commanded to a thousand generations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That He hath made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And doth establish it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel  -- a covenant age-during,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying, `To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion  of your inheritance,`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In their being few in number, But a few, and sojourners  in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they go up and down, from nation unto nation, From a  kingdom unto another people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He hath not suffered any to oppress them And He reproveth  for their sakes kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`Strike not against Mine anointed, And to My prophets do  not evil.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He calleth a famine on the land, The whole staff of  bread He hath broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He hath sent before them a man, For a servant hath Joseph  been sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They have afflicted with fetters his feet, Iron hath  entered his soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Till the time of the coming of His word The saying of  Jehovah hath tried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king hath sent, and looseth him, The ruler of the  peoples, and draweth him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He hath made him lord of his house, And ruler over all  his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, And his elders he  maketh wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Israel cometh in to Egypt, And Jacob hath sojourned  in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He maketh His people very fruitful, And maketh it  mightier than its adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He turned their heart to hate His people, To conspire  against His servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He hath sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He had fixed  on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They have set among them the matters of His signs, And  wonders in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He hath sent darkness, and it is dark, And they have not  provoked His word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He hath turned their waters to blood, And putteth to  death their fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Teemed hath their land [with] frogs, In the inner  chambers of their kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He hath said, and the beetle cometh, Lice into all their  border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He hath made their showers hail, A flaming fire [is] in  their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He smiteth their vine and their fig, And shivereth  the trees of their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He hath said, and the locust cometh, And the cankerworm  -- innumerable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it consumeth every herb in their land, And it  consumeth the fruit of their ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He smiteth every first-born in their land, The  first-fruit of all their strength,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And bringeth them out with silver and gold, And there is  not in its tribes a feeble one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Rejoiced hath Egypt in their going forth, For their fear  had fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He hath spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to  enlighten the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They have asked, and He bringeth quails, And [with] bread  of heaven satisfieth them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He hath opened a rock, and waters issue, They have gone  on in dry places -- a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For He hath remembered His holy word, With Abraham His  servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He bringeth forth His people with joy, With singing  His chosen ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He giveth to them the lands of nations, And the  labour of peoples they possess,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>That they may observe His statutes, And His laws may  keep. Praise ye Jehovah!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
