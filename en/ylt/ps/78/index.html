Give ear, O my people, to my law,  Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I open with a simile my mouth, I bring forth hidden things  of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That we have heard and do know, And our fathers have  recounted to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We do not hide from their sons, To a later generation  recounting praises of Jehovah, And His strength, and His  wonders that He hath done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob, And a law hath  placed in Israel, That He commanded our fathers, To make them  known to their sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So that a later generation doth know, Sons who are born, do  rise and recount to their sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And place in God their confidence, And forget not the  doings of God, But keep His commands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they are not like their fathers, A generation apostate  and rebellious, A generation! it hath not prepared its heart,  Nor stedfast with God [is] its spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Sons of Ephraim -- armed bearers of bow, Have turned in a  day of conflict.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have not kept the covenant of God, And in His law  they have refused to walk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they forget His doings, And His wonders that He shewed  them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Before their fathers He hath done wonders, In the land of  Egypt -- the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He cleft a sea, and causeth them to pass over, Yea, He  causeth waters to stand as a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And leadeth them with a cloud by day, And all the night  with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness, And giveth drink -- as  the great deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And bringeth out streams from a rock, And causeth waters  to come down as rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they add still to sin against Him, To provoke the Most  High in the dry place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they try God in their heart, To ask food for their  lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they speak against God -- they said: `Is God able to  array a table in a wilderness?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Lo, He hath smitten a rock, And waters flow, yea, streams  overflow. `Also -- bread [is] He able to give? Doth He prepare  flesh for His people?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore hath Jehovah heard, And He sheweth Himself  wroth, And fire hath been kindled against Jacob, And anger also  hath gone up against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For they have not believed in God, Nor have they trusted  in His salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He commandeth clouds from above, Yea, doors of the  heavens He hath opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He raineth on them manna to eat, Yea, corn of heaven  He hath given to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Food of the mighty hath each eaten, Venison He sent to  them to satiety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He causeth an east wind to journey in the heavens, And  leadeth by His strength a south wind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He raineth on them flesh as dust, And as sand of the  seas -- winged fowl,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And causeth [it] to fall in the midst of His camp, Round  about His tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, And their desire  He bringeth to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They have not been estranged from their desire, Yet [is]  their food in their mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the anger of God hath gone up against them, And He  slayeth among their fat ones, And youths of Israel He caused to  bend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With all this they have sinned again, And have not  believed in His wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He consumeth in vanity their days, And their years in  trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If He slew them, then they sought Him, And turned back,  and sought God earnestly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remember that God [is] their rock, And God Most  High their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And -- they deceive Him with their mouth, And with their  tongue do lie to Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And their heart hath not been right with Him, And they  have not been stedfast in His covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He -- the Merciful One, Pardoneth iniquity, and  destroyeth not, And hath often turned back His anger, And  waketh not up all His fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He remembereth that they [are] flesh, A wind going on  -- and it returneth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, Grieve  Him in the desolate place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea, they turn back, and try God, And the Holy One of  Israel have limited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them  from the adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the  field of Zoan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He turneth to blood their streams, And their floods  they drink not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sendeth among them the beetle, and it consumeth them,  And the frog, and it destroyeth them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And giveth to the caterpillar their increase, And their  labour to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyeth with hail their vine, And their sycamores  with frost,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And delivereth up to the hail their beasts, And their  cattle to the burning flames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He sendeth on them the fury of His anger, Wrath, and  indignation, and distress -- A discharge of evil messengers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He pondereth a path for His anger, He kept not back their  soul from death, Yea, their life to the pestilence He delivered  up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt, The first-fruit  of the strong in tents of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And causeth His people to journey as a flock, And guideth  them as a drove in a wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And He leadeth them confidently, And they have not been  afraid, And their enemies hath the sea covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And He bringeth them in unto the border of His sanctuary,  This mountain His right hand had got,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And casteth out nations from before them, And causeth them  to fall in the line of inheritance, And causeth the tribes of  Israel to dwell in their tents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they tempt and provoke God Most High, And His  testimonies have not kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they turn back, And deal treacherously like their  fathers, They have been turned like a deceitful bow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And make Him angry with their high places, And with their  graven images make Him zealous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>God hath heard, and sheweth Himself wroth. And kicketh  exceedingly against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And He leaveth the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent He had  placed among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And He giveth His strength to captivity, And His beauty  into the hand of an adversary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And delivereth up to the sword His people, And with His  inheritance shewed Himself angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>His young men hath fire consumed, And His virgins have not  been praised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>His priests by the sword have fallen, And their widows  weep not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And the Lord waketh as a sleeper, As a mighty one crying  aloud from wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And He smiteth His adversaries backward, A reproach  age-during He hath put on them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And He kicketh against the tent of Joseph, And on the  tribe of Ephraim hath not fixed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And He chooseth the tribe of Judah, With mount Zion that  He loved,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And buildeth His sanctuary as a high place, Like the  earth, He founded it to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And He fixeth on David His servant, And taketh him from  the folds of a flock,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From behind suckling ones He hath brought him in, To rule  over Jacob His people, And over Israel His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And he ruleth them according to the integrity of his  heart, And by the skilfulness of his hands leadeth them!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
