Of the kind acts of  Jehovah, to the age I sing, To all generations I make known Thy  faithfulness with my mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For I said, `To the age is kindness built, The heavens!  Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness in them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have made a covenant for My chosen, I have sworn to David  My servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>`Even to the age do I establish thy seed, And have built to  generation and generation thy throne. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the heavens confess Thy wonders, O Jehovah, Thy  faithfulness also [is] in an assembly of holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For who in the sky, Compareth himself to Jehovah? Is like  to Jehovah among sons of the mighty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>God is very terrible, In the secret counsel of His holy  ones, And fearful over all surrounding Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O Jehovah, God of Hosts, Who [is] like Thee -- a strong  Jah? And Thy faithfulness [is] round about Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou [art] ruler over the pride of the sea, In the lifting  up of its billows Thou dost restrain them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou hast bruised Rahab, as one wounded.

For ever doth Thy  fury burn as fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Remember, I pray Thee, what [is] life-time? Wherefore in  vain hast Thou created All the sons of men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Who [is] the man that liveth, and doth not see death? He  delivereth his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Where [are] Thy former kindnesses, O Lord. Thou hast sworn  to David in Thy faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, I have  borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Wherewith Thine enemies reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith  they have reproached The steps of Thine anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Blessed [is] Jehovah to the age. Amen, and amen!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
