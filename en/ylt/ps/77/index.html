My  voice [is] to God, and I cry, my voice [is] to God, And He hath  given ear unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In a day of my distress the Lord I sought, My hand by night  hath been spread out, And it doth not cease, My soul hath  refused to be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I remember God, and make a noise, I meditate, and feeble is  my spirit. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thou hast taken hold of the watches of mine eyes, I have  been moved, and I speak not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have reckoned the days of old, The years of the ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I remember my music in the night, With my heart I meditate,  and my spirit doth search diligently:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To the ages doth the Lord cast off? Doth He add to be  pleased no more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The saying failed to all  generations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Hath God forgotten [His] favours? Hath He shut up in anger  His mercies? Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I say: `My weakness is, The changes of the right hand  of the Most High.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I mention the doings of Jah, For I remember of old Thy  wonders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I have meditated on all Thy working, And I talk  concerning Thy doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O God, in holiness [is] Thy way, Who [is] a great god like  God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou [art] the God doing wonders. Thou hast made known  among the peoples Thy strength,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou hast redeemed with strength Thy people, The sons of  Jacob and Joseph.
