Jehovah, Thou hast  searched me, and knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou -- Thou hast known my sitting down, And my rising up,  Thou hast attended to my thoughts from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My path and my couch Thou hast fanned, And [with] all my  ways hast been acquainted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there is not a word in my tongue, Lo, O Jehovah, Thou  hast known it all!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behind and before Thou hast besieged me, And Thou dost  place on me Thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Knowledge too wonderful for me, It hath been set on high,  I am not able for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whither do I go from Thy Spirit? And whither from Thy face  do I flee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I ascend the heavens -- there Thou [art], And spread  out a couch in Sheol, lo, Thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I take the wings of morning, I dwell in the uttermost part  of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also there Thy hand doth lead me, And Thy right hand doth  hold me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I say, `Surely darkness bruiseth me, Then night [is]  light to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Also darkness hideth not from Thee, And night as day  shineth, as [is] darkness so [is] light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For Thou -- Thou hast possessed my reins, Thou dost cover  me in my mother`s belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I confess Thee, because that [with] wonders I have been  distinguished. Wonderful [are] Thy works, And my soul is  knowing [it] well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My substance was not hid from Thee, When I was made in  secret, Curiously wrought in the lower part of earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Mine unformed substance Thine eyes saw, And on Thy book  all of them are written, The days they were formed -- And not  one among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And to me how precious have been Thy thoughts, O God, how  great hath been their sum!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I recount them! than the sand they are more, I have  waked, and I am still with Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Dost Thou slay, O God, the wicked? Then, men of blood,  turn aside from me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who exchange Thee for wickedness, Lifted up to vanity  [are] Thine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not I hate, Jehovah, those hating Thee? And with Thy  withstanders grieve myself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[With] perfect hatred I have hated them, Enemies they  have become to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Search me, O God, and know my heart, Try me, and know my  thoughts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And see if a grievous way be in me, And lead me in a way  age-during!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
