A Psalm. Hear this,  all ye peoples, Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Both low and high, together rich and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My mouth speaketh wise things, And the meditations of my  heart [are] things of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I incline to a simile mine ear, I open with a harp my  riddle:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my  supplanters doth compass me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Those trusting on their wealth, And in the multitude of  their riches, Do shew themselves foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A brother doth no one at all ransom, He doth not give to  God his atonement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And precious [is] the redemption of their soul, And it hath  ceased -- to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And still he liveth for ever, He seeth not the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he seeth wise men die, Together the foolish and  brutish perish, And have left to others their wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Their heart [is]: Their houses [are] to the age, Their  tabernacles to all generations. They proclaimed their names  over the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And man in honour doth not remain, He hath been like the  beasts, they have been cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This their way [is] folly for them, And their posterity  with their sayings are pleased. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As sheep for Sheol they have set themselves, Death doth  afflict them, And the upright rule over them in the morning,  And their form [is] for consumption. Sheol [is] a dwelling for  him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only, God doth ransom my soul from the hand of Sheol, For  He doth receive me. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Fear not, when one maketh wealth, When the honour of his  house is abundant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For at his death he receiveth nothing, His honour goeth  not down after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For his soul in his life he blesseth, (And they praise  thee when thou dost well for thyself.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It cometh to the generation of his fathers, For ever they  see not the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Man in honour, who understandest not, Hath been like the  beasts, they have been cut off!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
