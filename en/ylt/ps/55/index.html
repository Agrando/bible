Give ear, O God, [to] my prayer, And  hide not from my supplication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Attend to me, and answer me, I mourn in my meditation, and  make a noise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Because of the voice of an enemy, Because of the oppression  of the wicked, For they cause sorrow to move against me, And in  anger they hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart is pained within me, And terrors of death have  fallen on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fear and trembling come in to me, And horror doth cover me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I say, `Who doth give to me a pinion as a dove? I fly  away and rest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo, I move far off, I lodge in a wilderness. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I hasten escape for myself, From a rushing wind, from a  whirlwind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Swallow up, O Lord, divide their tongue, For I saw violence  and strife in a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By day and by night they go round it, on its walls. Both  iniquity and perverseness [are] in its midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Mischiefs [are] in its midst. Fraud and deceit depart not  from its street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For an enemy reproacheth me not, or I bear [it], He who is  hating me Hath not magnified himself against me, Or I hide from  him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But thou, a man -- as mine equal, My familiar friend, and  mine acquaintance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When together we sweeten counsel, Into the house of God we  walk in company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Desolations [are] upon them, They go down [to] Sheol --  alive, For wickedness [is] in their dwelling, in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I -- to God I call, and Jehovah saveth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Evening, and morning, and noon, I meditate, and make a  noise, and He heareth my voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He hath ransomed in peace my soul From him who is near to  me, For with the multitude they were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God doth hear and afflict them, And He sitteth of old.  Selah. Because they have no changes, and fear not God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He hath sent forth his hands against his well-wishers, He  hath polluted his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Sweeter than honey hath been his mouth, And his heart [is]  war! Softer have been his words than oil, And they [are] drawn  [swords].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Cast on Jehovah that which He hath given thee, And He doth  sustain thee, He doth not suffer for ever the moving of the  righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Thou, O God, dost bring them down To a pit of  destruction, Men of blood and deceit reach not to half their  days, And I -- I do trust in Thee!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
