Soundeth all  His praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>O the happiness of those keeping judgment, Doing  righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O Jehovah, With the favour of Thy people,  Look after me in Thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>To look on the good of Thy chosen ones, To rejoice in the  joy of Thy nation, To boast myself with Thine inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers, We have done perversely,  we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers in Egypt, Have not considered wisely Thy  wonders, They have not remembered The abundance of Thy kind  acts, And provoke by the sea, at the sea of Suph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He saveth them for His name`s sake, To make known His  might,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And rebuketh the sea of Suph, and it is dried up, And  causeth them to go Through depths as a wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He saveth them from the hand Of him who is hating,  And redeemeth them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And waters cover their adversaries, One of them hath not  been left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they believe in His words, they sing His praise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They have hasted -- forgotten His works, They have not  waited for His counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they lust greatly in a wilderness, And try God in a  desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He giveth to them their request, And sendeth leanness  into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they are envious of Moses in the camp, Of Aaron,  Jehovah`s holy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Earth openeth, and swalloweth up Dathan, And covereth  over the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And fire burneth among their company, A flame setteth on  fire the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They make a calf in Horeb, And bow themselves to a molten  image,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And change their Honour Into the form of an ox eating  herbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have forgotten God their saviour, The doer of great  things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, Of fearful things  by the sea of Suph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He saith to destroy them, Unless Moses, His chosen  one, Had stood in the breach before Him, To turn back His wrath  from destroying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they kick against the desirable land, They have not  given credence to His word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they murmur in their tents, They have not hearkened  to the voice of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He lifteth up His hand to them, To cause them to fall  in a wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And to cause their seed to fall among nations, And to  scatter them through lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they are coupled to Baal-Peor, And eat the sacrifices  of the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they provoke to anger by their actions, And a plague  breaketh forth upon them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Phinehas standeth, and executeth judgment, And the  plague is restrained,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it is reckoned to him to righteousness, To all  generations -- unto the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, And it is  evil to Moses for their sakes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For they have provoked his spirit, And he speaketh  wrongfully with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They have not destroyed the peoples, As Jehovah had said  to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And serve their idols, And they are to them for a snare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they sacrifice their sons And their daughters to  destroyers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they shed innocent blood -- Blood of their sons and  of their daughters, Whom they have sacrificed to idols of  Canaan, And the land is profaned with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they are defiled with their works, And commit  whoredom in their habitual doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the anger of Jehovah Is kindled against His people,  And He doth abominate His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And giveth them into the hand of nations, And those  hating them rule over them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And their enemies oppress them, And they are humbled  under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times He doth deliver them, And they rebel in their  counsel, And they are brought low in their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He looketh on their distress When He heareth their  cry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And remembereth for them His covenant, And is comforted,  According to the abundance of His kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And He appointeth them for mercies Before all their  captors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the  nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To glory in Thy  praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age even  unto the age. And all the people said, `Amen, praise Jah!`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
