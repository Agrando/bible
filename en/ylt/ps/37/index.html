Do not fret because of evil doers, Be not envious  against doers of iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For as grass speedily they are cut off, And as the  greenness of the tender grass do fade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Trust in Jehovah, and do good, Dwell [in] the land, and  enjoy faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And delight thyself on Jehovah, And He giveth to thee the  petitions of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Roll on Jehovah thy way, And trust upon Him, and He  worketh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And hath brought out as light thy righteousness, And thy  judgment as noon-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be silent for Jehovah, and stay thyself for Him, Do not  fret because of him Who is making prosperous his way, Because  of a man doing wicked devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Desist from anger, and forsake fury, Fret not thyself only  to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evil doers are cut off, As to those waiting on Jehovah,  they possess the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And yet a little, and the wicked is not, And thou hast  considered his place, and it is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the humble do possess the land, And they have  delighted themselves In the abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked is devising against the righteous, And gnashing  against him his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord doth laugh at him, For He hath seen that his day  cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A sword have the wicked opened, And they have trodden  their bow, To cause to fall the poor and needy, To slaughter  the upright of the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword doth enter into their own heart, And their  bows are shivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better [is] the little of the righteous, Than the store of  many wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked are shivered, And Jehovah is  sustaining the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect, And their  inheritance is -- to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in days of  famine they are satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked perish, and the enemies of Jehovah, As the  preciousness of lambs, Have been consumed, In smoke they have  been consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked is borrowing and repayeth not, And the  righteous is gracious and giving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For His blessed ones do possess the land, And His reviled  ones are cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>From Jehovah [are] the steps of a man, They have been  prepared, And his way he desireth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When he falleth, he is not cast down, For Jehovah is  sustaining his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Young I have been, I have also become old, And I have not  seen the righteous forsaken, And his seed seeking bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day he is gracious and lending, And his seed [is]  for a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Turn aside from evil, and do good, and dwell to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For Jehovah is loving judgment, And He doth not forsake  His saintly ones, To the age they have been kept, And the seed  of the wicked is cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous possess the land, And they dwell for ever on  it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And his tongue  speaketh judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God [is] his heart, His steps do not slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked is watching for the righteous, And is seeking  to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jehovah doth not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him in  his being judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Look unto Jehovah, and keep His way, And He doth exalt  thee to possess the land, In the wicked being cut off -- thou  seest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked terrible, And spreading as a green  native plant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he passeth away, and lo, he is not, And I seek him,  and he is not found!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Observe the perfect, and see the upright, For the latter  end of each [is] peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And transgressors were destroyed together, The latter end  of the wicked was cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the salvation of the righteous [is] from Jehovah,  Their strong place in a time of adversity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jehovah doth help them and deliver them, He delivereth  them from the wicked, And saveth them, Because they trusted in  Him!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
