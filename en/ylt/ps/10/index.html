Thou dost hide  in times of adversity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They  are caught in devices that they devised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul,  And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised  Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth  not. `God is not!` [are] all his devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Pain do his ways at all times, On high [are] Thy judgments  before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He hath said in his heart, `I am not moved,` To generation  and generation not in evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under  his tongue [is] perverseness and iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places  he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch  secretly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert.
