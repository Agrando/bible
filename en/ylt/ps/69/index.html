Save me, O  God, for come have waters unto the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have sunk in deep mire, And there is no standing, I have  come into the depths of the waters, And a flood hath overflown  me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have been wearied with my calling, Burnt hath been my  throat, Consumed have been mine eyes, waiting for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those hating me without cause Have been more than the hairs  of my head, Mighty have been my destroyers, My lying enemies,  That which I took not away -- I bring back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, Thou -- Thou hast known Concerning my overturn, And  my desolations from Thee have not been hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not those waiting on Thee be ashamed because of me, O  Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, Let not those seeking Thee Blush  because of me, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For because of Thee I have borne reproach, Shame hath  covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A stranger I have been to my brother, And a foreigner to  sons of my mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For zeal for Thy house hath consumed me, And the reproaches  of Thy reproachers Have fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I weep in the fasting of my soul, And it is for a  reproach to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I make my clothing sackcloth, And I am to them for a  simile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me, And  those drinking strong drink, Play on instruments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I -- my prayer [is] to Thee, O Jehovah, A time of good  pleasure, O God, In the abundance of Thy kindness, Answer me in  the truth of Thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me from the mire, and let me not sink, Let me be  delivered from those hating me, And from deep places of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not a flood of waters overflow me, Nor let the deep  swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut her mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Answer me, O Jehovah, for good [is] Thy kindness,  According to the abundance Of Thy mercies turn Thou unto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And hide not Thy face from Thy servant, For I am in  distress -- haste, answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Be near unto my soul -- redeem it, Because of mine enemies  ransom me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou -- Thou hast known my reproach, And my shame, and my  blushing, Before Thee [are] all mine adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am sick, And I look  for a bemoaner, and there is none, And for comforters, and I  have found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they give for my food gall, And for my thirst cause me  to drink vinegar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Their table before them is for a snare, And for a  recompence -- for a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Darkened are their eyes from seeing, And their loins  continually shake Thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour upon them Thine indignation, And the fierceness of  Thine anger doth seize them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Their tower is desolated, In their tents there is no  dweller.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they have pursued him Thou hast smitten, And recount  of the pain of Thy pierced ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Give punishment for their iniquity, And they enter not  into Thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They are blotted out of the book of life, And with the  righteous are not written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I [am] afflicted and pained, Thy salvation, O God,  doth set me on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I praise the name of God with a song, And I magnify Him  with thanksgiving,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it is better to Jehovah than an ox, A bullock --  horned -- hoofed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The humble have seen -- they rejoice, Ye who seek God --  and your heart liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For Jehovah hearkeneth unto the needy, And His bound ones  He hath not despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The heavens and earth do praise Him, Seas, and every  moving thing in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God doth save Zion, And doth build the cities of  Judah, And they have dwelt there, and possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the seed of His servants inherit it, And those loving  His name dwell in it!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
