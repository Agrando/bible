Only -- good to Israel [is] God, to the  clean of heart. And I -- as a little thing, My feet have been  turned aside,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious  of the boastful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at  their death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And their might [is] firm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men  they are not plagued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them  as a dress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the  heart transgressed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of  oppression, From on high they speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue  walketh in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of  fulness are wrung out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they have said, `How hath God known? And is there  knowledge in the Most High?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Lo, these [are] the wicked and easy ones of the age, They  have increased strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Only -- a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash  in innocency my hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof [is] every  morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I have said, `I recount thus,` Lo, a generation of Thy  sons I have deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I think to know this, Perverseness it [is] in mine  eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to  their latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast  caused them to fall to desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They  have been ended -- consumed from terrors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image  Thou despisest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick  themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been  with Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I [am] continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on  my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost  receive me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have  desired in earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my  heart and my portion [is] God to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off  every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I -- nearness of God to me [is] good, I have placed in  the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
