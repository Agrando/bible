good, for to the age [is]  His kindness:`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let the redeemed of Jehovah say, Whom He redeemed from the  hand of an adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And from the lands hath gathered them, From east and from  west, From north, and from the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, A  city of habitation they have not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry -- yea -- thirsty, Their soul in them becometh  feeble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their  distress He delivereth them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And causeth them to tread in a right way, To go unto a  city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to  the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For He hath satisfied a longing soul, And a hungry soul  hath filled [with] goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, Prisoners of  affliction and of iron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because they changed the saying of God, And the counsel  of the Most High despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He humbleth with labour their heart, They have been  feeble, and there is no helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their  distresses He saveth them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He bringeth them out from the dark place, And  death-shade, And their bands He draweth away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to  the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For He hath broken doors of brass, And bars of iron He  hath cut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools, by means of their transgression, And by their  iniquities, afflict themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All food doth their soul abominate, And they come nigh  unto the gates of death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their  distresses He saveth them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sendeth His word and healeth them, And delivereth from  their destructions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to  the sons of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, And  recount His works with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Those going down [to] the sea in ships, Doing business in  many waters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They have seen the works of Jehovah, And His wonders in  the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He saith, and appointeth a tempest, And it lifteth up  its billows,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They go up [to] the heavens, they go down [to] the  depths, Their soul in evil is melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, And all  their wisdom is swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they cry to Jehovah in their adversity, And from  their distresses He bringeth them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He establisheth a whirlwind to a calm, And hushed are  their billows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they rejoice because they are quiet, And He leadeth  them to the haven of their desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to  the sons of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And in  the seat of the elders praise Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He maketh rivers become a wilderness, And fountains of  waters become dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A fruitful land becometh a barren place, For the  wickedness of its inhabitants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He maketh a wilderness become a pool of water, And a dry  land become fountains of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He causeth the hungry to dwell there, And they  prepare a city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, And they make  fruits of increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He blesseth them, and they multiply exceedingly, And  their cattle He doth not diminish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they are diminished, and bow down, By restraint,  evil, and sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He is pouring contempt upon nobles, And causeth them to  wander in vacancy -- no way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And setteth on high the needy from affliction, And  placeth families as a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The upright do see and rejoice, And all perversity hath  shut her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Who [is] wise, and observeth these? They understand the  kind acts of Jehovah!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
