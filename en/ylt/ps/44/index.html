An Instruction. O  God, with our ears we have heard, Our fathers have recounted to  us, The work Thou didst work in their days, In the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou, [with] Thy hand, nations hast dispossessed. And Thou  dost plant them. Thou afflictest peoples, and sendest them  away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For, not by their sword Possessed they the land, And their  arm gave not salvation to them, But Thy right hand, and Thine  arm, And the light of Thy countenance, Because Thou hadst  accepted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thou [art] He, my king, O God, Command the deliverances of  Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>By Thee our adversaries we do push, By Thy name tread down  our withstanders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For, not in my bow do I trust, And my sword doth not save  me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And those  hating us Thou hast put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In God we have boasted all the day, And Thy name to the age  we thank.
