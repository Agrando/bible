O Jehovah, God of my salvation, Daily I  have cried, nightly before Thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>My prayer cometh in before Thee, Incline Thine ear to my  loud cry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For my soul hath been full of evils, And my life hath come  to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have been reckoned with those going down [to] the pit, I  have been as a man without strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Among the dead -- free, As pierced ones lying in the grave,  Whom Thou hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by Thy hand  have been cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in  depths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Upon me hath Thy fury lain, And [with] all Thy breakers  Thou hast afflicted. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me, Thou hast made  me an abomination to them, Shut up -- I go not forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Mine eye hath grieved because of affliction, I called Thee,  O Jehovah, all the day, I have spread out unto Thee my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they  thank Thee? Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness  in destruction?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are Thy wonders known in the darkness? And Thy  righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, unto Thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, And in the  morning doth my prayer come before Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why, O Jehovah, castest Thou off my soul? Thou hidest Thy  face from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I [am] afflicted, and expiring from youth, I have borne  Thy terrors -- I pine away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Over me hath Thy wrath passed, Thy terrors have cut me  off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They have surrounded me as waters all the day, They have  gone round against me together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou hast put far from me lover and friend, Mine  acquaintance [is] the place of darkness!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
