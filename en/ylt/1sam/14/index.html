and the people knew not that Jonathan hath gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass over  unto the station of the Philistines [is] the edge of a rock on  the one side, and the edge of a rock on the other side, and the  name of the one is Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The one edge [is] fixed on the north over-against Michmash,  and the one on the south over-against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jonathan saith unto the young man bearing his weapons,  `Come, and we pass over unto the station of these  uncircumcised; it may be Jehovah doth work for us, for there  is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the bearer of his weapons saith to him, `Do all that  [is] in thy heart; turn for thee; lo, I [am] with thee, as  thine own heart.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jonathan saith, `Lo, we are passing over unto the men,  and are revealed unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>if thus they say unto us, `Stand still till we have come  unto you,` then we have stood in our place, and do not go up  unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if thus they say, `Come up against us,` then we have  gone up, for Jehovah hath given them into our hand, and this to  us [is] the sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And revealed are both of them unto the station of the  Philistines, and the Philistines say, `Lo, Hebrews are coming  out of the holes where they have hid themselves.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men of the station answer Jonathan, and the bearer  of his weapons, and say, `Come up unto us, and we cause you to  know something.` And Jonathan saith unto the bearer of his  weapons, `Come up after me, for Jehovah hath given them into  the hand of Israel.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jonathan goeth up on his hands, and on his feet, and  the bearer of his weapons after him; and they fall before  Jonathan, and the bearer of his weapons is putting to death  after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the first smiting which Jonathan and the bearer of his  weapons have smitten is of about twenty men, in about half a  furrow of a yoke of a field,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and there is a trembling in the camp, in the field, and  among all the people, the station and the destroyers have  trembled -- even they, and the earth shaketh, and it becometh a  trembling of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin see, and  lo, the multitude hath melted away, and it goeth on, and is  beaten down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul saith to the people who [are] with him, `Inspect,  I pray you, and see; who hath gone from us?` and they inspect,  and lo, Jonathan and the bearer of his weapons are not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul saith to Ahiah, `Bring nigh the ark of God;` for  the ark of God hath been on that day with the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it cometh to pass, while Saul spake unto the priest,  that the noise which [is] in the camp of the Philistines goeth  on, going on and becoming great, and Saul saith unto the  priest, `Remove thy hand.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul is called, and all the people who [are] with him,  and they come in unto the battle, and, lo, the sword of each  hath been against his neighbour -- a very great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Hebrews [who] have been for the Philistines as  heretofore, who had gone up with them into the camp, have  turned round, even they, to be with Israel who [are] with Saul  and Jonathan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and all the men of Israel, who are hiding themselves in  the hill-country of Ephraim, have heard that the Philistines  have fled, and they pursue -- even they -- after them in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah saveth Israel on that day, and the battle hath  passed over to Beth-Aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the men of Israel have been distressed on that day,  and Saul adjureth the people, saying, `Cursed [is] the man who  eateth food till the evening, and I have been avenged of mine  enemies;` and none of the people hath tasted food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all [they of] the land have come into a forest, and  there is honey on the face of the field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the people come in unto the forest, and lo, the honey  dropped, and none is moving his hand unto his mouth, for the  people feared the oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jonathan hath not heard of his father`s adjuring the  people, and putteth forth the end of the rod, which [is] in his  hand, and dippeth it in the honeycomb, and bringeth back his  hand unto his mouth -- and his eyes see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And a man of the people answereth and saith, `Thy father  certainly adjured the people, saying, Cursed [is] the man who  eateth food to-day; and the people are weary.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jonathan saith, `My father hath troubled the land;  see, I pray you, that mine eyes have become bright because I  tasted a little of this honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How much more if the people had well eaten to-day of the  spoil of its enemies which it hath found, for now, the smiting  hath not been great among the Philistines.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they smite on that day among the Philistines from  Michmash to Aijalon, and the people are very weary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the people make unto the spoil, and take sheep, and  oxen, and sons of the herd, and slaughter on the earth, and the  people eat with the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they declare to Saul, saying, `Lo, the people are  sinning against Jehovah, to eat with the blood.` And he saith,  `Ye have dealt treacherously, roll unto me to-day a great  stone.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Saul saith, `Be ye scattered among the people, and ye  have said to them, Bring ye nigh unto me each his ox, and each  his sheep; and ye have slain [them] in this place, and eaten,  and ye do not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood.` And  all the people bring nigh each his ox, in his hand, that night,  and slaughter [them] there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Saul buildeth an alter to Jehovah; with it he hath  begun to build altars to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Saul saith, `Let us go down after the Philistines by  night, and we prey upon them till the light of the morning,  and leave not a man of them.` And they say, `All that is good  in thine eyes do.` And the priest saith, `Let us draw near  hither unto God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Saul asketh of God, `Do I go down after the  Philistines? dost Thou give them into the hand of Israel?`  and He hath not answered him on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul saith, `Draw ye nigh hither all, the chiefs of  the people, and know and see in what this sin hath been to-day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>for, Jehovah liveth, who is saving Israel: surely if it  be in Jonathan my son, surely he doth certainly die;` and none  is answering him out of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he saith unto all Israel, `Ye -- ye are on one side,  and I and Jonathan my son are on another side;` and the people  say unto Saul, `That which is good in thine eyes do.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Saul saith unto Jehovah, God of Israel, `Give  perfection;` and Jonathan and Saul are captured, and the  people went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Saul saith, `Cast between me and Jonathan my son;`  and Jonathan is captured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Saul saith unto Jonathan, `Declare to me, what hast  thou done?` and Jonathan declareth to him, and saith, `I  certainly tasted with the end of the rod that [is] in my hand a  little honey; lo, I die!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Saul saith, `Thus doth God do, and thus doth He add,  for thou dost certainly die, Jonathan.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the people say unto Saul, `Doth Jonathan die who  wrought this great salvation in Israel? -- a profanation!  Jehovah liveth, if there falleth from the hair of his head to  the earth, for with God he hath wrought this day;` and the  people rescue Jonathan, and he hath not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Saul goeth up from after the Philistines, and the  Philistines have gone to their place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and Saul captured the kingdom over Israel, and he fighteth  round about against all his enemies, against Moab, and against  the Bene-Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of  Zobah, and against the Philistines, and whithersoever he  turneth he doth vex [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he maketh a force, and smiteth Amalek, and delivereth  Israel out of the hand of its spoiler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the sons of Saul are Jonathan, and Ishui, and  Melchi-Shua; as to the name of his two daughters, the name of  the first-born [is] Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and the name of the wife of Saul [is] Ahinoam, daughter of  Ahimaaz; and the name of the head of his host [is] Abner son of  Ner, uncle of Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and Kish [is] father of Saul, and Ner father of Abner [is]  son of Ahiel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the war is severe against the Philistines all the days  of Saul; when Saul hath seen any mighty man, and any son of  valour, then he doth gather him unto himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
