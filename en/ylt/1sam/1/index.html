and why dost thou not eat? and why is thy heart  afflicted? am I not better to thee than ten sons?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Hannah riseth after eating in Shiloh, and after  drinking, and Eli the priest is sitting on the throne by the  side-post of the temple of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she is bitter in soul, and prayeth unto Jehovah, and  weepeth greatly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and voweth a vow, and saith, `Jehovah of Hosts, if Thou  dost certainly look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and hast  remembered me, and dost not forget Thy handmaid, and hast given  to Thy handmaid seed of men -- then I have given him to Jehovah  all days of his life, and a razor doth not go up upon his  head.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it hath been, when she multiplied praying before  Jehovah, that Eli is watching her mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and Hannah, she is speaking to her heart, only her lips are  moving, and her voice is not heard, and Eli reckoneth her to be  drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli saith unto her, `Until when are thou drunken?
