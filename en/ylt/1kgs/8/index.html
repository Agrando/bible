pestilence -- when it  is; blasting, mildew, locust; caterpillar -- when it is; when  its enemy hath distressed it in the land [in] its gates, any  plague, any sickness, --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>any prayer, any supplication that [is] of any man of all  Thy people Israel, who know each the plague of his own heart,  and hath spread his hands towards this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then Thou dost hear in the heavens, the settled place of  Thy dwelling, and hast forgiven, and hast done, and hast given  to each according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest,  (for Thou hast known -- Thyself alone -- the heart of all the  sons of man),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>so that they fear Thee all the days that they are living on  the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>`And also, unto the stranger who is not of Thy people  Israel, and hath come from a land afar off for Thy name`s sake  --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>(for they hear of Thy great name, and of Thy strong hand,  and of Thy stretched-out arm) -- and he hath come in and prayed  towards this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou dost hear in the heavens, the settled place of Thy  dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger  calleth unto Thee for, in order that all the peoples of the  earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee like Thy people Israel,  and to know that Thy name hath been called on this house which  I have builded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>`When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemy,  in the way that Thou dost send them, and they have prayed unto  Jehovah the way of the city which thou hast fixed on, and of  the house which I have builded for Thy name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>then Thou hast heard in the heavens their prayer and their  supplication, and hast maintained their cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>`When they sin against Thee (for there is not a man who  sinneth not), and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast  given them up before an enemy, and they have taken captive  their captivity unto the land of the enemy far off or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and they have turned [it] back unto their heart in the land  whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and  made supplication unto Thee, in the land of their captors,  saying, We have sinned and done perversely -- we have done  wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>yea, they have turned back unto Thee, with all their heart,  and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies who have  taken them captive, and have prayed unto Thee the way of their  land, which Thou gavest to their fathers, the city which Thou  hast chosen, and the house which I have builded for Thy name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>`Then Thou hast heard in the heavens, the settled place of  Thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplication, and hast  maintained their cause,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and hast forgiven Thy people who have sinned against Thee,  even all their transgressions which they have transgressed  against Thee, and hast given them mercies before their captors,  and they have had mercy [on] them --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(for Thy people and Thy inheritance [are] they, whom Thou  didst bring out of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of  iron) --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for Thine eyes being open unto the supplication of Thy  servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to  hearken unto them in all they call unto Thee for;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>for Thou hast separated them to Thyself for an inheritance,  out of all the peoples of the earth, as Thou didst speak by the  hand of Moses Thy servant, in Thy bringing out our fathers from  Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And it cometh to pass, at Solomon`s finishing to pray unto  Jehovah all this prayer and supplication, he hath risen from  before the altar of Jehovah, from bending on his knees, and his  hands spread out to the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and he standeth and blesseth all the assembly of Israel  [with] a loud voice, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>`Blessed [is] Jehovah who hath given rest to His people  Israel, according to all that He hath spoken; there hath not  fallen one word of all His good word, which He spake by the  hand of Moses his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>`Jehovah our God is with us as He hath been with our  fathers; He doth not forsake us nor leave us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>to incline our heart unto Himself, to walk in all His ways,  and to keep His commands, and His statutes, and His judgments,  which He commanded our fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>and these my words with which I have made supplication  before Jehovah, are near unto Jehovah our God by day and by  night, to maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of  His people Israel, the matter of a day in its day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>for all the peoples of the earth knowing that Jehovah, He  [is] God; there is none else;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and your heart hath been perfect with Jehovah our God, to  walk in His statutes, and to keep His commands, as [at] this  day.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the king and all Israel with him are sacrificing a  sacrifice before Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>and Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of peace-offerings,  which he hath sacrificed to Jehovah, oxen, twenty and two  thousand, and sheep, a hundred and twenty thousand; and the  king and all the sons of Israel dedicate the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>On that day hath the king sanctified the middle of the  court that [is] before the house of Jehovah, for he hath made  there the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat of the  peace-offerings; for the altar of brass that [is] before  Jehovah [is] too little to contain the burnt-offering, and the  present, and the fat of the peace-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And Solomon maketh, at that time, the festival -- and all  Israel with him, a great assembly from the entering in of  Hamath unto the brook of Egypt -- before Jehovah our God, seven  days and seven days; fourteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>On the eighth day he hath sent the people away, and they  bless the king, and go to their tents, rejoicing and glad of  heart for all the good that Jehovah hath done to David His  servant, and to Israel His people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
