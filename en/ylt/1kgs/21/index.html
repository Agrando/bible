-- thy spirit sulky, and thou art not  eating bread!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he saith unto her, `Because I speak unto Naboth the  Jezreelite, and say to him, Give to me thy vineyard for money,  or if thou desire, I give to thee a vineyard in its stead; and  he saith, I do not give to thee my vineyard.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jezebel his wife saith unto him, `Thou now dost execute  rule over Israel! rise, eat bread, and let thy heart be glad,  -- I do give to thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And she writeth letters in the name of Ahab, and sealeth  with his seal, and sendeth the letters unto the elders, and  unto the freemen, who are in his city, those dwelling with  Naboth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and she writeth in the letters, saying, `Proclaim a fast,  and cause Naboth to sit at the head of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and cause two men -- sons of worthlessness -- to sit  over-against him, and they testify of him, saying, Thou hast  blessed God and Melech; and they have brought him out, and  stoned him, and he dieth.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of his city, the elders and the freemen who  are dwelling in his city, do as Jezebel hath sent unto them, as  written in the letters that she sent unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>they have proclaimed a fast, and caused Naboth to sit at  the head of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and two men -- sons of worthlessness -- come in, and sit  over-against him, and the men of worthlessness testify of him,  even Naboth, before the people, saying, `Naboth blessed God and  Melech;` and they take him out to the outside of the city, and  stone him with stones, and he dieth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and they send unto Jezebel, saying, `Naboth was stoned,  and is dead.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it cometh to pass, at Jezebel`s hearing that Naboth  hath been stoned, and is dead, that Jezebel saith unto Ahab,  `Rise, possess the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, that he  refused to give to thee for money, for Naboth is not alive but  dead.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it cometh to pass, at Ahab`s hearing that Naboth is  dead, that Ahab riseth to go down unto the vineyard of Naboth  the Jezreelite, to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the word of Jehovah is unto Elijah the Tishbite,  saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`Rise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who [is] in  Samaria, -- lo, in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he hath gone  down to possess it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and thou hast spoken unto him, saying, Thus said Jehovah,  Hast thou murdered, and also possessed?

 because that he hath been humbled before Me, I bring not in the  evil in his days; in the days of his son I bring in the evil on  his house.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
