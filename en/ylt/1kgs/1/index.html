entering into days, and they cover  him with garments, and he hath no heat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and his servants say to him, `Let them seek for my lord the  king a young woman, a virgin, and she hath stood before the  king, and is to him a companion, and hath lain in thy bosom,  and my lord the king hath heat.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they seek a fair young woman in all the border of  Israel, and find Abishag the Shunammite, and bring her in to  the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and the young woman [is] very very fair, and she is to the  king a companion, and serveth him, and the king hath not known  her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Adonijah son of Haggith is lifting himself up, saying,  `I do reign;` and he prepareth for himself a chariot and  horsemen, and fifty men running before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and his father hath not grieved him [all] his days, saying,  `Wherefore thus hast thou done?` and he also [is] of a very  good form, and [his mother] bare him after Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And his words are with Joab son of Zeruiah, and with  Abiathar the priest, and they help after Adonijah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and  Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty ones  whom David hath, have not been with Adonijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Adonijah sacrificeth sheep and oxen and fatlings near  the stone of Zoheleth, that [is] by En-Rogel, and calleth all  his brethren, sons of the king, and for all the men of Judah,  servants of the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty ones,  and Solomon his brother, he hath not called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Nathan speaketh unto Bath-Sheba, mother of Solomon,  saying, `Hast thou not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith hath  reigned, and our lord David hath not known?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and now, come, let me counsel thee, I pray thee, and  deliver thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>go and enter in unto king David, and thou hast said unto  him, Hast thou not, my lord, O king, sworn to thy handmaid,  saying, Surely Solomon thy son doth reign after me, and he doth  sit on my throne? and wherefore hath Adonijah reigned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Lo, thou are yet speaking there with the king, and I come  in after thee, and have completed thy words.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto the king, to the inner  chamber, and the king [is] very aged, and Abishag the  Shunammite is serving the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Bath-Sheba boweth and doth obeisance to the king, and  the king saith, `What -- to thee?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she saith to him, `My lord, thou hast sworn by Jehovah  thy God to thy handmaid: Surely Solomon thy son doth reign  after me, and he doth sit on my throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and now, lo, Adonijah hath reigned, and now, my lord, O  king, thou hast not known;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he sacrificeth ox, and fatling, and sheep in abundance,  and calleth for all the sons of the king, and for Abiathar the  priest, and for Joab head of the host -- and for Solomon thy  servant he hath not called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel [are] on  thee, to declare to them who doth sit on the throne of my lord  the king after him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and it hath been, when my lord the king lieth with his  fathers, that I have been, I and my son Solomon -- [reckoned]  sinners.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And lo, she is yet speaking with the king, and Nathan the  prophet hath come in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they declare to the king, saying, `Lo, Nathan the  prophet;` and he cometh in before the king, and boweth himself  to the king, on his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Nathan saith, `My lord, O king, thou hast said,  Adonijah doth reign after me, and he doth sit on my throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for he hath gone down to-day, and doth sacrifice ox, and  fatling, and sheep, in abundance, and calleth for all the sons  of the king, and for the heads of the host, and for Abiathar  the priest, and lo, they are eating and drinking before him,  and they say, Let king Adonijah live!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And for me -- me, thy servant, and for Zadok the priest,  and for Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and for Solomon thy servant,  he hath not called;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>if from my lord the king this thing hath been, then thou  hast not caused thy servant to know who doth sit on the throne  of my lord the king after him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And king David answereth and saith, `Call for me for  Bath-Sheba;` and she cometh in before the king, and standeth  before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king sweareth and saith, `Jehovah liveth, who hath  redeemed my soul out of all adversity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>surely as I sware to thee by Jehovah, God of Israel,  saying, Surely Solomon thy son doth reign after me, and he doth  sit on my throne in my stead; surely so I do this day.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Bath-Sheba boweth -- face to the earth -- and doth  obeisance to the king, and saith, `Let my lord, king David,  live to the age.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And king David saith, `Call for me for Zadok the priest,  and for Nathan the prophet, and for Benaiah son of Jehoiada;`  and they come in before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king saith to them, `Take with you the servants of  your lord, and ye have caused Solomon my son to ride on mine  own mule, and caused him to go down unto Gihon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and anointed him there hath Zadok the priest -- and Nathan  the prophet -- for king over Israel, and ye have blown with a  trumpet, and said, Let king Solomon live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and ye have come up after him, and he hath come in and hath  sat on my throne, and he doth reign in my stead, and him I have  appointed to be leader over Israel, and over Judah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Benaiah son of Jehoiada answereth the king, and saith,  `Amen! so doth Jehovah, God of my lord the king, say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>as Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, so is He with  Solomon, and doth make his throne greater than the throne of my  lord king David.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Zadok the priest goeth down, and Nathan the prophet,  and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite, and the  Pelethite, and they cause Solomon to ride on the mule of king  David, and cause him to go unto Gihon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and Zadok the priest taketh the horn of oil out of the  tent, and anointeth Solomon, and they blow with a trumpet, and  all the people say, `Let king Solomon live.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the people come up after him, and the people are  piping with pipes, and rejoicing -- great joy, and the earth  rendeth with their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Adonijah heareth, and all those called, who [are] with  him, and they have finished to eat, and Joab heareth the noise  of the trumpet, and saith, `Wherefore [is] the noise of the  city roaring?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He is yet speaking, and lo, Jonathan son of Abiathar the  priest hath come in, and Adonijah saith, `Come in, for a man of  valour thou [art], and thou bearest good tidings.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jonathan answereth and saith to Adonijah, `Verily our  lord king David hath caused Solomon to reign,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the king sendeth with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan  the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite,  and the Pelethite, and they cause him to ride on the king`s  mule,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and they anoint him -- Zadok the priest and Nathan the  prophet -- for king in Gihon, and are come up thence rejoicing,  and the city is moved; it [is] the noise that ye have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>`And also Solomon hath sat on the throne of the kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and also the servants of the king have come into bless our  lord king David, saying, Thy God doth make the name of Solomon  better than thy name, and his throne greater than thy throne;  and the king boweth himself on the bed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and also thus hath the king said, Blessed [is] Jehovah, God  of Israel, who hath given to-day [one] sitting on my throne,  and mine eyes seeing.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they tremble, and rise -- all those called who [are]  for Adonijah -- and go, each on his way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and Adonijah feareth because of Solomon, and riseth, and  goeth, and layeth hold on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it is declared to Solomon, saying, `Lo, Adonijah  feareth king Solomon, and lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of  the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me as to-day -- he  doth not put to death his servant by the sword.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Solomon saith, `If he becometh a virtuous man -- there  doth not fall of his hair to the earth, and if evil is found in  him -- then he hath died.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And king Solomon sendeth, and they bring him down from off  the altar, and he cometh in and boweth himself to king Solomon,  and Solomon saith to him, `Go to thy house.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
