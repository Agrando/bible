and after the  wind a shaking: -- not in the shaking [is] Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and after the shaking a fire: -- not in the fire [is]  Jehovah; and after the fire a voice still small;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and it cometh to pass, at Elijah`s hearing [it], that he  wrappeth his face in his robe, and goeth out, and standeth at  the opening of the cave, and lo, unto him [is] a voice, and it  saith, `What -- to thee, here, Elijah?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he saith, `I have been very zealous for Jehovah, God  of Hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant,  Thine altars they have thrown down, and Thy prophets they have  slain by the sword, and I am left, I, by myself, and they seek  my life -- to take it.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah saith unto him, `Go turn back on thy way to  the wilderness of Damascus, and thou hast gone in, and anointed  Hazael for king over Aram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Jehu son of Nimshi thou dost anoint for king over  Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat, of Abel-Meholah, thou dost  anoint for prophet in thy stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`And it hath been, him who is escaped from the sword of  Hazael, put to death doth Jehu, and him who is escaped from the  sword of Jehu put to death doth Elisha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and I have left in Israel seven thousand, all the knees  that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that hath not  kissed him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he goeth thence, and findeth Elisha son of Shaphat,  and he is plowing; twelve yoke [are] before him, and he [is]  with the twelfth; and Elijah passeth over unto him, and casteth  his robe upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he forsaketh the oxen, and runneth after Elijah, and  saith, `Let me give a kiss, I pray thee, to my father and to my  mother, and I go after thee.` And he saith to him, `Go, turn  back, for what have I done to thee?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he turneth back from after him, and taketh the yoke of  oxen, and sacrificeth it, and with instruments of the oxen he  hath boiled their flesh, and giveth to the people, and they  eat, and he riseth, and goeth after Elijah, and serveth him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
