one casting, one measure,  one form, have they all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he maketh ten lavers of brass; forty baths doth the one  laver contain, four by the cubit [is] the one laver, one laver  on the one base [is] to the ten bases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and he putteth the five bases on the right side of the  house, and five on the left side of the house, and the sea he  hath put on the right side of the house, eastward --  over-against the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Hiram maketh the lavers, and the shovels, and the  bowls; and Hiram completeth to do all the work that he made for  king Solomon, [for] the house of Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>pillars two, and bowls of the chapiters that [are] on the  top of the pillars two, and the nets two, to cover the two  bowls of the chapiters that [are] on the top of the pillars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and the pomegranates four hundred for the two nets, two  rows of pomegranates for the one net, to cover the two bowls of  the chapiters that [are] on the front of the pillars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the one sea, the twelve oxen under the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls; and all these  vessels, that Hiram hath made to king Solomon [for] the house  of Jehovah, [are] of brass -- polished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them, in  the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zarthan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Solomon placeth the whole of the vessels; because of  the very great abundance, the weight of the brass hath not been  searched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Solomon maketh all the vessels that [are] in the house  of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table -- on which [is]  the bread of the Presence -- of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and the candlesticks, five on the right, and five on the  left, before the oracle, of refined gold, and the flowers, and  the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and the basins, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the  spoons, and the censers, of refined gold, and the hinges for  the doors of the inner-house, for the holy of holies, for the  doors of the house of the temple, of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it is complete -- all the work that king Solomon hath  made [for] the house of Jehovah, and Solomon bringeth in the  sanctified things of David his father; the silver, and the  gold, and the vessels he hath put in the treasuries of the  house of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
