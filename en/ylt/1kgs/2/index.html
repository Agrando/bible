saying,  There is not cut off a man of thine from the throne of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>`And also, thou hast known that which he did to me -- Joab  son of Zeruiah -- that which he did to two heads of the hosts  of Israel, to Abner son of Ner, and to Amasa son of Jether --  that he slayeth them, and maketh the blood of war in peace, and  putteth the blood of war in his girdle, that [is] on his loins,  and in his sandals that [are] on his feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and thou hast done according to thy wisdom, and dost not let  his old age go down in peace to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite thou dost do  kindness, and they have been among those eating at thy table,  for so they drew near unto me in my fleeing from the face of  Absalom thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`And lo, with thee [is] Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite of  Bahurim, and he reviled me -- a grievous reviling -- in the day  of my going to Mahanaim; and he hath come down to meet me at  the Jordan, and I swear to him by Jehovah, saying, I do not put  thee to death by the sword;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and now, acquit him not, for a wise man thou [art], and thou  hast known that which thou dost to him, and hast brought down  his old age with blood to Sheol.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David lieth down with his fathers, and is buried in the  city of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the days that David hath reigned over Israel [are]  forty years, in Hebron he hath reigned seven years, and in  Jerusalem he hath reigned thirty and three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Solomon hath sat on the throne of David his father, and  his kingdom is established greatly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and Adonijah son of Haggith cometh in unto Bath-Sheba,  mother of Solomon, and she saith, `Is thy coming peace?` and he  saith, `Peace.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he saith, `I have a word unto thee,` and she saith,  `Speak.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he saith, `Thou hast known that the kingdom was mine,  and towards me set their faces had all Israel for reigning, and  the kingdom is turned round about, and is my brother`s, for  from Jehovah it was his;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and now, one petition I am asking of thee -- turn not back  my face;` and she saith unto him, `Speak.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he saith, `Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, for  he doth not turn back thy face, and he doth give to me Abishag  the Shunammite for a wife.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bath-Sheba saith, `Good; I do speak for thee unto the  king.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto king Solomon to speak to him  for Adonijah, and the king riseth to meet her, and boweth  himself to her, and sitteth on his throne, and placeth a throne  for the mother of the king, and she sitteth at his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she saith, `One small petition I ask of thee, turn not  back my face;` and the king saith to her, `Ask, my mother, for  I do not turn back thy face.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she saith, `Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to  Adonijah thy brother for a wife.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And king Solomon answereth and saith to his mother, `And  why art thou asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? also  ask for him the kingdom -- for he [is] mine elder brother --  even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of  Zeruiah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And king Solomon sweareth by Jehovah, saying, `Thus doth  God to me, and thus He doth add -- surely against his soul hath  Adonijah spoken this word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and now, Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and  causeth me to sit on the throne of David my father, and who  hath made for me an house as He spake -- surely to-day is  Adonijah put to death.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And king Solomon sendeth by the hand of Benaiah son of  Jehoiada, and he falleth upon him, and he dieth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Abiathar the priest said the king, `To Anathoth go,  unto thy fields; for a man of death thou [art], but in this day  I do not put thee to death, because thou hast borne the ark of  the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast  afflicted in all that my father was afflicted in.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Solomon casteth out Abiathar from being priest to  Jehovah, to fulfil the word of Jehovah which He spake  concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the report hath come unto Joab -- for Joab hath turned  aside after Adonijah, though after Absalom he did not turn  aside -- and Joab fleeth unto the tent of Jehovah, and layeth  hold on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it is declared to king Solomon that Joab hath fled unto  the tent of Jehovah, and lo, near the altar; and Solomon  sendeth Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, `Go, fall upon him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Benaiah cometh in unto the tent of Jehovah, and saith  unto him, `Thus said the king, Come out;` and he saith, `Nay,  but here I die.` And Benaiah bringeth back the king word,  saying, `Thus spake Joab, yea, thus he answered me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king saith to him, `Do as he hath spoken, and fall  upon him, and thou hast buried him, and turned aside the  causeless blood which Joab shed, from off me, and from off the  house of my father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and Jehovah hath turned back his blood on his own head, who  hath fallen on two men more righteous and better than he, and  slayeth them with the sword, -- and my father David knew not --  Abner son of Ner, head of the host of Israel, and Amasa son of  Jether, head of the host of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>yea, turned back hath their blood on the head of Joab, and  on the head of his seed to the age; and for David, and for his  seed, and for his house, and for his throne, there is peace  unto the age, from Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Benaiah son of Jehoiada goeth up and falleth upon him,  and putteth him to death, and he is buried in his own house in  the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and the king putteth Benaiah son of Jehoiada in his stead  over the host, and Zadok the priest hath the king put in the  stead of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the king sendeth and calleth for Shimei, and saith to  him, `Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and thou hast dwelt  there, and dost not go out thence any where;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and it hath been, in the day of thy going out, and thou  hast passed over the brook Kidron, thou dost certainly know  that thou dost surely die -- thy blood is on thy head.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Shimei saith to the king, `The word [is] good; as my  lord the king hath spoken so doth thy servant do;` and Shimei  dwelleth in Jerusalem many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it cometh to pass, at the end of three years, that flee  do two of the servants of Shimei unto Achish son of Maachah,  king of Gath, and they declare to Shimei, saying, `Lo, thy  servants [are] in Gath;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and Shimei riseth, and saddleth his ass, and goeth to Gath,  unto Achish, to seek his servants, and Shimei goeth and  bringeth his servants from Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it is declared to Solomon that Shimei hath gone from  Jerusalem to Gath, and doth return,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and the king sendeth and calleth for Shimei, and saith unto  him, `Have I not caused thee to swear by Jehovah -- and I  testify against thee, saying, In the day of thy going out, and  thou hast gone anywhere, thou dost certainly know that thou  dost surely die; and thou sayest unto me, The word I have heard  [is] good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and wherefore hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and  the charge that I charged upon thee?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the king saith unto Shimei, `Thou hast known all the  evil that thy heart hath known, which thou didest to David my  father, and Jehovah hath turned back thine evil on thy head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and king Solomon [is] blessed, and the throne of David is  established before Jehovah unto the age.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the king chargeth Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he goeth  out and falleth on him, and he dieth, and the kingdom is  established in the hand of Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
