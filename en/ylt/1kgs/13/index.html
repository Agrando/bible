come from Judah, by the word of  Jehovah, unto Beth-El, and Jeroboam is standing by the altar --  to make perfume;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and he calleth against the altar, by the word of Jehovah,  and saith, `Altar! altar! thus said Jehovah, Lo, a son is born  to the house of David -- Josiah his name -- and he hath  sacrificed on thee the priests of the high places who are  making perfume on thee, and bones of man are burnt on thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he hath given on that day a sign, saying, `This [is]  the sign that Jehovah hath spoken, Lo, the altar is rent, and  the ashes poured forth that [are] on it.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it cometh to pass, at the king`s hearing the word of  the man of God that he calleth against the altar in Beth-El,  that Jeroboam putteth forth his hand from off the altar,  saying, `Catch him;` and his hand is dried up that he hath put  forth against him, and he is not able to bring it back unto  him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the altar is rent, and the ashes poured forth from the  altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by  the word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king answereth and saith unto the man of God,  `Appease, I pray thee, the face of Jehovah thy God, and pray  for me, and my hand doth come back unto me;` and the man of God  appeaseth the face of Jehovah, and the hand of the king cometh  back unto him, and it is as at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king speaketh unto the man of God, `Come in with me  to the house, and refresh thyself, and I give to thee a gift.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the man of God saith unto the king, `If thou dost give  to me the half of thine house, I do not go in with thee, nor do  I eat bread, nor do I drink water, in this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for so He commanded me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou  dost not eat bread nor drink water, nor turn back in the way  that thou hast come.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he goeth on in another way, and hath not turned back  in the way in which he came in unto Beth-El.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And a certain aged prophet is dwelling in Beth-El, and his  son cometh and recounteth to him all the deed that the man of  God hath done to-day in Beth-El, the words that he hath spoken  unto the king, -- yea, they recount them to their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their father saith unto them, `Where [is] this -- the  way he hath gone?` and his sons see the way that the man of God  hath gone who came from Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he saith unto his sons, `Saddle for me the ass,` and  they saddle for him the ass, and he rideth on it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and goeth after the man of God, and findeth him sitting  under the oak, and saith unto him, `Art thou the man of God who  hast come from Judah?` and he saith, `I [am].`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he saith unto him, `Come with me to the house, and eat  bread.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saith, `I am not able to turn back with thee, and  to go in with thee, nor do I eat bread or drink with thee water  in this place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for a word [is] unto me by the word of Jehovah, Thou dost  not eat bread nor drink there water, thou dost not turn back to  go in the way in which thou camest.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he saith to him, `I also [am] a prophet like thee, and  a messenger spake unto me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring  him back with thee unto thy house, and he doth eat bread and  drink water;` -- he hath lied to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he turneth back with him, and eateth bread in his  house, and drinketh water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it cometh to pass -- they are sitting at the table --  and a word of Jehovah is unto the prophet who brought him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he calleth unto the man of God who came from Judah,  saying, `Thus said Jehovah, Because that thou hast provoked the  mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the command that Jehovah  thy God charged thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and turnest back and dost eat bread and drink water in the  place of which He said unto thee, Thou dost not eat bread nor  drink water -- thy carcase cometh not in unto the burying-place  of thy fathers.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it cometh to pass, after his eating bread, and after  his drinking, that he saddleth for him the ass, for the prophet  whom he had brought back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he goeth, and a lion findeth him in the way, and  putteth him to death, and his carcase is cast in the way, and  the ass is standing near it, and the lion is standing near the  carcase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And lo, men are passing by, and see the carcase cast in  the way, and the lion standing near the carcase, and they come  and speak [of it] in the city in which the old prophet is  dwelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the prophet who brought him back out of the way  heareth and saith, `It [is] the man of God who provoked the  mouth of Jehovah, and Jehovah giveth him to the lion, and it  destroyeth him, and putteth him to death, according to the word  of Jehovah that he spake to him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he speaketh unto his sons saying, `Saddle for me the  ass,` and they saddle [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he goeth and findeth his carcase cast in the way, and  the ass and the lion are standing near the carcase -- the lion  hath not eaten the carcase nor destroyed the ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the prophet taketh up the carcase of the man of God,  and placeth it on the ass, and bringeth it back, and the old  prophet cometh in unto the city to mourn and to bury him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and he placeth his carcase in his own grave, and they  mourn for him, `Oh, my brother!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it cometh to pass, after his burying him, that he  speaketh unto his sons, saying, `At my death -- ye have buried  me in the burying-place in which the man of God is buried; near  his bones place my bones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for the word certainly cometh to pass that he called by  the word of Jehovah concerning the altar which [is] Beth-El,  and concerning all the houses of the high places that [are] in  cities of Samaria.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After this thing Jeroboam hath not turned from his evil  way, and turneth back, and maketh of the extremities of the  people priests of high places; he who is desirous he  consecrateth his hand, and he is of the priests of the high  places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And in this thing is the sin of the house of Jeroboam,  even to cut [it] off, and to destroy [it] from off the face of  the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
