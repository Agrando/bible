 thou hast added wisdom and goodness unto the report that I  heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O the happiness of thy men, O the happiness of thy servants  -- these -- who are standing before thee continually, who are  hearing thy wisdom!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehovah thy God is blessed who delighted in thee, to put  thee on the throne of Israel; in Jehovah`s loving Israel to the  age He doth set thee for king, to do judgment and  righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she giveth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of  gold, and spices very many, and precious stone; there came not  like that spice any more for abundance that the queen of Sheba  gave to king Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And also, the navy of Hiram that bore gold from Ophir,  brought in from Ophir almug-trees very many, and precious  stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the king maketh the almug-trees a support for the  house of Jehovah, and for the house of the king, and harps and  psalteries for singers; there have not come such almug-trees,  nor have there been seen [such] unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire  that she asked, apart from that which he gave to her as a  memorial of king Solomon, and she turneth and goeth to her  land, she and her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the weight of the gold that hath come to Solomon in  one year is six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>apart from [that of] the tourists, and of the traffic of  the merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the  governors of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed  gold -- six hundred of gold go up on the one target;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and three hundred shields of alloyed gold -- three pounds  of gold go up on the one shield; and the king putteth them [in]  the house of the forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king maketh a great throne of ivory, and  overlayeth it with refined gold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>six steps hath the throne, and a round top [is] to the  throne behind it, and hands [are] on this [side] and on that,  unto the place of the sitting, and two lions are standing near  the hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps, on  this [side] and on that; it hath not been made so for any  kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon [are] of  gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon  [are] of refined gold -- there are none of silver; it was not  reckoned in the days of Solomon for anything,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for a navy of Tarshish hath the king at sea with a navy of  Hiram; once in three years cometh the navy of Tarshish, bearing  gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And king Solomon is greater than any of the kings of the  earth for riches and for wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and all the earth is seeking the presence of Solomon, to  hear his wisdom that God hath put into his heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and they are bringing each his present, vessels of silver,  and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices,  horses, and mules, the matter of a year in a year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Solomon gathereth chariots, and horsemen, and he hath  a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand  horsemen, and he placeth them in the cities of the chariot, and  with the king in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the king maketh the silver in Jerusalem as stones, and  the cedars he hath made as the sycamores that [are] in the low  country, for abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the outgoing of the horses that king Solomon hath  [is] from Egypt, and from Keveh; merchants of the king take  from Keveh at a price;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and a chariot cometh up and cometh out of Egypt for six  hundred silverlings, and a horse for fifty and a hundred, and  so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of  Aram; by their hand they bring out.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
