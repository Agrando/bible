as my people, so thy people; as  my horses, so thy horses.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehoshaphat saith unto the king of Israel, `Seek, I  pray thee, to-day, the word of Jehovah;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the king of Israel gathereth the prophets, about four  hundred men, and saith unto them, `Do I go against  Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?` and they say, `Go  up, and the Lord doth give [it] into the hand of the king.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehoshaphat saith, `Is there not here a prophet of  Jehovah besides, and we seek by him?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Yet -- one  man to seek Jehovah by him, and I have hated him, for he doth  not prophesy concerning me good, but evil -- Micaiah son of  Imlah;` and Jehoshaphat saith, `Let not the king say so.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king of Israel calleth unto a certain eunuch, and  saith, `Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah are  sitting, each on his throne, clothed with garments, in a  threshing-floor, at the opening of the gate of Samaria, and all  the prophets are prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah maketh for himself horns of  iron, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, By these thou dost push  the Aramaeans till they are consumed;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and all the prophets are prophesying so, saying, `Go up to  Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper, and Jehovah hath given [it] into  the hand of the king.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the messenger who hath gone to call Micaiah hath  spoken unto him, saying, `Lo, I pray thee, the words of the  prophets, with one mouth, [are] good towards the king; let it  be, I pray thee, thy word as the word of one of them -- and  thou hast spoken good.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Micaiah saith, `Jehovah liveth; surely that which  Jehovah saith unto me -- it I speak.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he cometh in unto the king, and the king saith unto  him, `Micaiah, do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead, to battle, or do we  forbear?` and he saith unto him, `Go up, and prosper, and  Jehovah hath given [it] into the hand of the king.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king saith unto him, `How many times am I adjuring  thee that thou speak nothing unto me but truth in the name of  Jehovah?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he saith, `I have seen all Israel scattered on the  hills as sheep that have no shepherd, and Jehovah saith, These  have no master; they turn back each to his house in peace.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Have I not  said unto thee, He doth not prophesy of me good, but evil?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he saith, `Therefore, hear a word of Jehovah; I have  seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the  heavens standing by Him, on His right and on His left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Jehovah saith, Who doth entice Ahab, and he doth go up  and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? and this one saith thus, and that  one is saying thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`And the spirit goeth out, and standeth before Jehovah,  and saith, I -- I do entice him;

only the high places have not turned aside,  yet are the people sacrificing and making perfume in high  places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jehoshaphat maketh peace with the king of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and the rest of the matters of Jehoshaphat, and his might  that he got, and with which he fought, are they not written on  the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the remnant of the whoremongers who were left in the  days of Asa his father he took away out of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and there is no king in Edom; he set up a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jehoshaphat made ships at Tarshish to go to Ophir for  gold, and they went not, for the ships were broken in  Ezion-Geber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then said Ahaziah son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, `Let my  servants go with thy servants in the ships;` and Jehoshaphat  was not willing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jehoshaphat lieth with his fathers, and is buried with  his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoram his  son reigneth in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ahaziah son of Ahab hath reigned over Israel in Samaria in  the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigneth  over Israel two years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and  walketh in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother,  and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat who caused Israel to  sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and serveth the Baal, and boweth himself to it, and  provoketh Jehovah, God of Israel, according to all that his  father had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
