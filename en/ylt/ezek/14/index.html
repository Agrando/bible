am I inquired of at all by  them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>`Therefore, speak with them, and thou hast said unto them:  Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Every one of the house of Israel  who causeth his idols to go up unto his heart, and the  stumbling-block of his iniquity setteth over-against his face,  and hath gone in unto the prophet -- I Jehovah have given an  answer to him for this, for the abundance of his idols,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>in order to catch the house of Israel by their heart, in  that they have become estranged from off me by their idols --  all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`Therefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus said the Lord  Jehovah: Turn ye back, yea, turn ye back from your idols, and  from all your abominations turn back your faces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for every one of the house of Israel, and of the sojourners  who doth sojourn in Israel, who is separated from after Me, and  doth cause his idols to go up unto his heart, and the  stumbling-block of his iniquity setteth over-against his face,  and hath come in unto the prophet to inquire of him concerning  Me, I, Jehovah, have answered him for Myself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and I have set My face against that man, and made him for a  sign, and for similes, and I have cut him off from the midst of  My people, and ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`And the prophet, when he is enticed, and hath spoken a  word -- I, Jehovah, I have enticed that prophet, and have  stretched out My hand against him, and have destroyed him from  the midst of My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they have borne their iniquity: as the iniquity of the  inquirer, so is the iniquity of the prophet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so that the house of Israel do not wander any more from  after Me, nor are defiled any more with all their  transgressions, and they have been to Me for a people, and I am  to them for God -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`Son of man, the land -- when it sinneth against Me to  commit a trespass, and I have stretched out My hand against it,  and broken for it the staff of bread, and sent into it famine,  and cut off from it man and beast --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and these three men have been in its midst, Noah, Daniel,  and Job -- they by their righteousness deliver their own soul  -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`If an evil beast I cause to pass through the land, and it  hath bereaved, and it hath been a desolation, without any  passing through because of the beast --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>these three men in its midst: I live -- an affirmation of  the Lord Jehovah -- neither sons nor daughters do they deliver;
