I live -- I am not sought by you -- an affirmation  of the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Dost thou judge them? Dost thou judge, son of man? The  abominations of their fathers cause them to know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and thou hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah:  In the day of My fixing on Israel, I lift up My hand, To the  seed of the house of Jacob, And am known to them in the land of  Egypt, And I lift up My hand to them, Saying, I [am] Jehovah  your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day I did lift up My hand to them, To bring them  forth from the land of Egypt, Unto a land that I spied out for  them, Flowing with milk and honey, A beauty it [is] to all the  lands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I say unto them, Let each cast away the detestable  things of his eyes, And with the idols of Egypt be not defiled,  I [am] Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And -- they rebel against Me, And have not been willing to  hearken to Me, Each, the detestable things of their eyes, They  have not cast away, And the idols of Egypt have not forsaken,  And I say -- to pour out My fury on them, To complete Mine  anger against them, In the midst of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I do [it] for My name`s sake, Not to pollute [it]  before the eyes of the nations, In whose midst they [are],  Before whose eyes I became known to them, To bring them out  from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I bring them out of the land of Egypt, And I bring  them in unto the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I give to them My statutes, And my judgments I caused  them to know, Which the man who doth -- liveth by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And also My sabbaths I have given to them, To be for a  sign between Me and them, To know that I [am] Jehovah their  sanctifier.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And -- rebel against me do the house of Israel in the  wilderness, In My statutes they have not walked, And My  judgments they have despised, Which the man who doth -- liveth  by them.
