and thou hast set thy heart to  the entrance of the house, with all the outlets of the  sanctuary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and hast said unto the rebellious, unto the house of  Israel: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough to you -- of all  your abominations, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In your bringing in sons of a stranger, uncircumcised of  heart, and uncircumcised of flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to  pollute it, even My house, in your bringing near My bread, fat,  and blood, and they break My covenant by all your abominations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and ye have not kept the charge of My holy things, and ye  set [them] for keepers of My charge in My sanctuary for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: No son of a stranger,  uncircumcised of heart, and uncircumcised of flesh, cometh in  unto My sanctuary, even any son of a stranger, who [is] in the  midst of the sons of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but -- the Levites who have gone far off from me, in the  wandering of Israel when they went astray from Me after their  idols, and they have borne their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they have been in My sanctuary ministrants, overseers  at the gates of the house, and ministrants at the house; they  slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and  they stand before them to serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because that they serve them before their idols, and have  been to the house of Israel for a stumbling-block of iniquity,  therefore I have lifted up my hand against them -- an  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah -- and they have borne their  iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they draw not nigh unto Me to act as My priest, and to  draw nigh unto any of My holy things, unto the holy of holies,  and they have borne their shame and their abominations that  they have done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I made them keepers of the charge of the house, for  all its service and for all that is done in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`And the priests, the Levites, sons of Zadok, who have  kept the charge of My sanctuary in the wandering of the sons of  Israel from off Me, they draw near unto Me to serve Me, and  have stood before Me, to bring near to Me fat and blood -- an  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>they come in unto My sanctuary, and they draw near unto My  table to serve Me, and they have kept My charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it hath come to pass, in their going in unto the gates  of the inner court, linen garments they put on; and no wool  cometh up on them in their ministering in the gates of the  inner court and within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Linen bonnets are on their head, and linen trousers are on  their loins, they are not restrained with sweat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in their going forth unto the outer court -- unto the  outer court unto the people -- they strip off their garments,  in which they are ministering, and have placed them in the holy  chambers, and have put on other garments; and they do not  sanctify the people in their own garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And their head they do not shave, and the lock they do not  send forth; they certainly poll their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And no priest doth drink wine in their coming in unto the  inner court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And a widow and divorced woman they do not take to them  for wives: but -- virgins of the seed of the house of Israel,  and the widow who is widow of a priest, do they take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`And My people they direct between holy and common, and  between unclean and clean they cause them to discern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And concerning controversy, they stand up for judgment;  with My judgments they judge it; and My law and My statutes in  all My appointed places they keep; and My sabbaths they  sanctify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And unto any dead man they come not for uncleanness, but  for father, and for mother, and for son, and for daughter, for  brother, for sister who hath not been to a man, they defile  themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And after his cleansing, seven days they number to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in the day of his coming in unto the sanctuary, unto  the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he bringeth near  his sin-offering -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it hath been to them for an inheritance; I [am] their  inheritance: and a possession ye do not give to them in Israel;  I [am] their possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The present, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering,  they do eat, and every devoted thing in Israel is theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the first of all the first-fruits of all, and every  heave-offering of all, of all your heave-offerings, are the  priests`: and the first of your dough ye give to the priest, to  cause a blessing to rest on thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Any carcase and torn thing, of the fowl, and of the  beasts, the priests do not eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
