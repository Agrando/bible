The flock do not the shepherds  feed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The fat ye do eat, and the wool ye put on, The fed one ye  slaughter, the flock ye feed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The weak ye have not strengthened, And the sick one ye have  not healed, And the broken ye have not bound up, And the driven  away have not brought back, And the lost ye have not sought,  And with might ye have ruled them and with rigour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they are scattered from want of a shepherd, And are for  food to every beast of the field, Yea, they are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Go astray do My flock on all the mountains, And on every  high hill, And on all the face of the land have My flock been  scattered, And there is none inquiring, and none seeking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, shepherds, hear a word of Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, If not,  because of My flock being for a prey, Yea, My flock is for food  to every beast of the field, Because there is no shepherd, And  My shepherds have not sought My flock, And the shepherds do  feed themselves, And My flock they have not fed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, O shepherds, hear a word of Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I [am] against the  shepherds, And have required My flock from their hand, And  caused them to cease from feeding the flock, And no more do the  shepherds feed themselves, And I have delivered My flock from  their mouth, And they are not to them for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I -- even I, have  required My flock, And I have sought it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As a shepherd`s searching of his drove, In the day of his  being in the midst of his scattered flock, so I do seek My  flock, And have delivered them out of all places, Whither they  have been scattered, In a day of cloud and thick darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And brought them out from the peoples, And have gathered  them from the lands, And brought them unto their own ground,  And have fed them on mountains of Israel, By streams, and by  all dwellings of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With good pasture I do feed them, And on mountains of the  high place of Israel is their habitation, There do they lie  down in a good habitation, And fat pastures they enjoy on  mountains of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I feed My flock, and cause them to lie down, An  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The lost I seek, and the driven away bring back, And the  broken I bind up, and the sick I strengthen, And the fat and  the strong I destroy, I feed it with judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you, My flock, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am  judging between sheep and sheep, Between rams and he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is it a little thing for you -- the good pasture ye enjoy,  And the remnant of your pasture ye tread down with your feet,  And a depth of waters ye do drink, And the remainder with your  feet ye trample,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And My flock the trodden thing of your feet consumeth, And  the trampled thing of your feet drinketh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah to them: Lo, I --  even I, have judged between fat sheep and lean sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because with side and with shoulder ye thrust away, And  with your horns push all the diseased, Till ye have scattered  them to the out-place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I have given safety to My flock, And they are not any  more for prey, And I have judged between sheep and sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And have raised up over them one shepherd, And he hath fed  them -- my servant David, He doth feed them, and he is their  shepherd,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I, Jehovah, I am their God, And My servant David  prince in their midst, I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I have made for them a covenant of peace, And caused  evil beasts to cease out of the land, And they have dwelt in a  wilderness confidently, And they have slept in forests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I have given them, and the suburbs of my hill, a  blessing, And caused the shower to come down in its season,  Showers of blessing they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And given hath the tree of the field its fruit, And the  land doth give her increase, And they have been on their land  confident, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah, In My  breaking the bands of their yoke, And I have delivered them  from the hand of those laying service on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they are no more a prey to nations, And the beast of  the earth devoureth them not, And they have dwelt confidently,  And there is none troubling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I have raised for them a plant for renown, And they  are no more consumed by hunger in the land, And they bear no  more the shame of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they have known that I, Jehovah, their God, [am] with  them, And they -- the house of Israel -- My people, An  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye, My flock, the flock of My pasture, Men ye [are] --  I [am] your God, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
