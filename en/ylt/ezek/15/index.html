The  vine-branch that hath been, Among trees of the forest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is wood taken from it to use for work? Do they take of it a  pin to hang any vessel on it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lo, to the fire it hath been given for fuel, Its two ends  hath the fire eaten, And its midst hath been scorched! Is it  profitable for work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Lo, in its being perfect it is not used for work, How much  less, when fire hath eaten of it, And it is scorched, Hath it  been used yet for work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree  among trees of the forest, That I have given to the fire for  fuel, So I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I have set My face against them, From the fire they  have gone forth, And the fire doth consume them, And ye have  known that I [am] Jehovah, In My setting My face against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I have made the land a desolation, Because they have  committed a trespass, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
