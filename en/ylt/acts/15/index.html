and the  blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for Moses from former generations in every city hath those  preaching him -- in the synagogues every sabbath being read.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with  the whole assembly, chosen men out of themselves to send to  Antioch with Paul and Barnabas -- Judas surnamed Barsabas, and  Silas, leading men among the brethren --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>having written through their hand thus: `The apostles, and  the elders, and the brethren, to those in Antioch, and Syria,  and Cilicia, brethren, who [are] of the nations, greeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from  us did trouble you with words, subverting your souls, saying  to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we did give no  charge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it seemed good to us, having come together with one  accord, chosen men to send unto you, with our beloved Barnabas  and Paul --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord  Jesus Christ --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>we have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, and they by word  are telling the same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, no more  burden to lay upon you, except these necessary things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>to abstain from things offered to idols, and blood, and a  strangled thing, and whoredom; from which keeping yourselves,  ye shall do well; be strong!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They then, indeed, having been let go, went to Antioch,  and having brought the multitude together, did deliver the  epistle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and they having read, did rejoice for the consolation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Judas also and Silas, being themselves also prophets,  through much discourse did exhort the brethren, and confirm,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and having passed some time, they were let go with peace  from the brethren unto the apostles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and it seemed good to Silas to remain there still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and  proclaiming good news -- with many others also -- the word of  the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and after certain days, Paul said unto Barnabas, `Having  turned back again, we may look after our brethren, in every  city in which we have preached the word of the Lord -- how  they are.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Barnabas counseled to take with [them] John called  Mark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and Paul was not thinking it good to take him with them  who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with  them to the work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>there came, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they  were parted from one another, and Barnabas having taken Mark,  did sail to Cyprus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and Paul having chosen Silas, went forth, having been  given up to the grace of God by the brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the  assemblies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
