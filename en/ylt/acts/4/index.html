because that,  indeed, a notable sign hath been done through them, to all  those dwelling in Jerusalem [is] manifest, and we are not able  to deny [it];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but that it may spread no further toward the people, let us  strictly threaten them no more to speak in this name to any  man.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And having called them, they charged them not to speak at  all, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Peter and John answering unto them said, `Whether it is  righteous before God to hearken to you rather than to God,  judge ye;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for we cannot but speak what we did see and hear.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they having further threatened [them], let them go,  finding nothing how they may punish them, because of the  people, because all were glorifying God for that which hath  been done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for above forty years of age was the man upon whom had been  done this sign of the healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being let go, they went unto their own friends, and  declared whatever the chief priests and the elders said unto  them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they having heard, with one accord did lift up the  voice unto God, and said, `Lord, thou [art] God, who didst  make the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that  [are] in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who, through the mouth of David thy servant, did say, Why  did nations rage, and peoples meditate vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were  gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for gathered together of a truth against Thy holy child  Jesus, whom Thou didst anoint, were both Herod and Pontius  Pilate, with nations and peoples of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do whatever Thy hand and Thy counsel did determine  before to come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to  Thy servants with all freedom to speak Thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>in the stretching forth of Thy hand, for healing, and  signs, and wonders, to come to pass through the name of Thy  holy child Jesus.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they having prayed, the place was shaken in which they  were gathered together, and they were all filled with the Holy  Spirit, and were speaking the word of God with freedom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and of the multitude of those who did believe the heart and  the soul was one, and not one was saying that anything of the  things he had was his own, but all things were to them in  common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power were the apostles giving the testimony  to the rising again of the Lord Jesus, great grace also was on  them all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>for there was not any one among them who did lack, for as  many as were possessors of fields, or houses, selling [them],  were bringing the prices of the thing sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and were laying them at the feet of the apostles, and  distribution was being made to each according as any one had  need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joses, who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas --  which is, having been interpreted, Son of Comfort -- a Levite,  of Cyprus by birth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>a field being his, having sold [it], brought the money and  laid [it] at the feet of the apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
