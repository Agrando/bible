because anything common or  unclean hath at no time entered into my mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven,  What God did cleanse, thou -- declare not thou common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to  the heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in  which I was, having been sent from Cesarea unto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing  doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did  enter into the house of the man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his  house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call  for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who shall speak sayings by which thou shalt be saved, thou  and all thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall  upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John  indeed did baptize with water, and ye shall be baptized with  the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us,  having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I -- how was I able  to withstand God?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were  glorifying God, saying, `Then, indeed, also to the nations did  God give the reformation to life.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad,  from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto  Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none  except to Jews only;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene,  who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the  Hellenists, proclaiming good news -- the Lord Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number  also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that  [is] in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas  to go through unto Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was  glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to  the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit,  and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it  came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in  the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also  were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to  Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did  signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be  throughout all the world -- which also came to pass in the time  of Claudius Caesar --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and the disciples, according as any one was prospering,  determined each of them to send for ministration to the  brethren dwelling in Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the  hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
