before Caesar it behoveth thee  to stand; and, lo, God hath granted to thee all those sailing  with thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>wherefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that  so it shall be, even as it hath been spoken to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the fourteenth night came -- we being borne up  and down in the Adria -- toward the middle of the night the  sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having  gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found  fifteen fathoms,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the  stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and  having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as [if] out of  the foreship they are about to cast anchors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, `If these  do not remain in the ship -- ye are not able to be saved;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and  suffered it to fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon  all to partake of nourishment, saying, `Fourteen days to-day,  waiting, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is  for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the  head fall;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and having said these things, and having taken bread, he  gave thanks to God before all, and having broken [it], he began  to eat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took  food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>(and we were -- all the souls in the ship -- two hundred,  seventy and six),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were  lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when the day came, they were not discerning the land,  but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which  they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and the anchors having taken up, they were committing [it]  to the sea, at the same time -- having loosed the bands of the  rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind -- they  were making for the shore,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the  ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast,  did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the  violence of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the soldiers` counsel was that they should kill the  prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them  from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having  cast themselves out first -- to get unto the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon  certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all  came safe unto the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
