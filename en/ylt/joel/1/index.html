Or in the days of your  fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Concerning it to your sons talk ye, And your sons to their  sons, And their sons to another generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>What is left of the palmer-worm, eaten hath the locust, And  what is left of the locust, Eaten hath the cankerworm, And what  is left of the cankerworm, Eaten hath the caterpillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep, And howl all drinking wine,  because of the juice, For it hath been cut off from your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For a nation hath come up on my land, Strong, and there is  no number, Its teeth [are] the teeth of a lion, And it hath the  jaw-teeth of a lioness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It hath made my vine become a desolation, And my fig-tree  become a chip, It hath made it thoroughly bare, and hath cast  down, Made white have been its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wail, as a virgin girdeth with sackcloth, For the husband of  her youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Cut off hath been present and libation from the house of  Jehovah, Mourned have the priests, ministrants of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Spoiled is the field, mourned hath the ground, For spoiled  is the corn, Dried up hath been new wine, languish doth oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Be ashamed, ye husbandmen, Howl, vine-dressers, for wheat  and for barley, For perished hath the harvest of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The vine hath been dried up, And the fig-tree doth  languish, Pomegranate, also palm, and apple-tree, All trees of  the field have withered, For dried up hath been joy from the  sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Gird, and lament, ye priests, Howl, ye ministrants of the  altar, Come in, lodge in sackcloth, ministrants of my God, For  withheld from the house of your God hath been present and  libation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Sanctify a fast, proclaim a restraint, Gather the elders --  all the inhabitants of the land, [Into] the house of Jehovah  your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And cry unto Jehovah, `Alas for the day!

Perplexed have been droves of oxen,  For there is no pasture for them, Also droves of sheep have  been desolated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I do call, For fire hath consumed  comely places of a wilderness, And a flame hath set on fire all  trees of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also the cattle of the field long for Thee, For dried up  have been streams of water, And fire hath consumed comely  places of a wilderness!`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
