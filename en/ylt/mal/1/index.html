And if I  [am] a father, where [is] Mine honour? And if I [am] a master,  where [is] My fear? Said Jehovah of Hosts to you, O priests,  despising My name! And ye have said: `In what have we despised  Thy name?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye are bringing nigh on Mine altar polluted bread, And ye  have said: `In what have we polluted Thee?` In your saying:  `The table of Jehovah -- it [is] despicable,`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when ye bring nigh the blind for sacrifice, `There is no  evil,` And when ye bring nigh the lame and sick, `There is no  evil;` Bring it near, I pray thee, to thy governor -- Doth he  accept thee? or doth he lift up thy face? Said Jehovah of  Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now, appease, I pray thee, the face of God, And He doth  favour us; From your own hand hath this been, Doth He accept of  you appearances? Said Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who [is] even among you, And he shutteth the two-leaved  doors? Yea, ye do not kindle Mine altar for nought, I have no  pleasure in you, said Jehovah of Hosts, And a present I do not  accept of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, from the rising of the sun to its going in, Great [is]  My name among nations, And in every place perfume is brought  nigh to My name, and a pure present, For great [is] My name  among nations, Said Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye are polluting it in your saying, `The table of  Jehovah -- it is polluted, As to its fruit -- despicable is its  food.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye have said, `Lo, what a weariness,` And ye have  puffed at it, said Jehovah of Hosts, And ye have brought in  plunder, And the lame and the sick, And ye have brought in the  present! Do I accept it from your hand? said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And cursed [is] a deceiver, who hath in his drove a male,  And is vowing, and is sacrificing a marred thing to the Lord,  For a great king [am] I, said Jehovah of Hosts, And My name  [is] revered among nations!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
