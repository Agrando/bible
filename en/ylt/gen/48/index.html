 Ephraim and Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon they are mine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and thy family which thou hast begotten after them are  thine; by the name of their brethren they are called in their  inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`And I -- in my coming in from Padan-[Aram] Rachel hath  died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, while yet a  kibrath of land to enter Ephrata, and I bury her there in the  way of Ephrata, which [is] Bethlehem.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Israel seeth the sons of Joseph, and saith, `Who [are]  these?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and Joseph saith unto his father, `They [are] my sons, whom  God hath given to me in this [place];` and he saith, `Bring  them, I pray thee, unto me, and I bless them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the eyes of Israel have been heavy from age, he is  unable to see; and he bringeth them nigh unto him, and he  kisseth them, and cleaveth to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Israel saith unto Joseph, `To see thy face I had not  thought, and lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph bringeth them out from between his knees, and  boweth himself on his face to the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and Joseph taketh them both, Ephraim in his right hand  towards Israel`s left, and Manasseh in his left towards  Israel`s right, and bringeth [them] nigh to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Israel putteth out his right hand, and placeth [it]  upon the head of Ephraim, who [is] the younger, and his left  hand upon the head of Manasseh; he hath guided his hands  wisely, for Manasseh [is] the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he blesseth Joseph, and saith, `God, before whom my  fathers Abraham and Isaac walked habitually: God who is feeding  me from my being unto this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the Messenger who is redeeming me from all evil doth bless  the youths, and my name is called upon them, and the name of my  fathers Abraham and Isaac; and they increase into a multitude  in the midst of the land.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joseph seeth that his father setteth his right hand on  the head of Ephraim, and it is wrong in his eyes, and he  supporteth the hand of his father to turn it aside from off the  head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Joseph saith unto his father, `Not so, my father, for  this [is] the first-born; set thy right hand on his head.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And his father refuseth, and saith, `I have known, my son,  I have known; he also becometh a people, and he also is great,  and yet, his young brother is greater than he, and his seed is  the fulness of the nations;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he blesseth them in that day, saying, `By thee doth  Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh;`  and he setteth Ephraim before Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel saith unto Joseph, `Lo, I am dying, and God  hath been with you, and hath brought you back unto the land of  your fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I -- I have given to thee one portion above thy  brethren, which I have taken out of the hand of the Amorite by  my sword and by my bow.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
