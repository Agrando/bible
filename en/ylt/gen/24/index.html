then thou  hast been acquitted from my oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>`And I come to-day unto the fountain, and I say, Jehovah,  God of my lord Abraham, if Thou art, I pray Thee, making  prosperous my way in which I am going --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>(lo, I am standing by the fountain of water), then the  virgin who is coming out to draw, and I have said unto her,  Let me drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and she hath said unto me, Both drink thou, and also for  thy camels I draw -- she is the woman whom Jehovah hath decided  for my lord`s son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>`Before I finish speaking unto my heart, then lo, Rebekah  is coming out, and her pitcher on her shoulder, and she goeth  down to the fountain, and draweth; and I say unto her, Let me  drink, I pray thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and she hasteth and letteth down her pitcher from off her  and saith, Drink, and thy camels also I water; and I drink, and  the camels also she hath watered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>`And I ask her, and say, Whose daughter [art] thou? and  she saith, Daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah hath  borne to him, and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets  on her hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and I bow, and do obeisance before Jehovah, and I bless  Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, who hath led me in the true  way to receive the daughter of my lord`s brother for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>`And now, if ye are dealing kindly and truly with my lord,  declare to me; and if not, declare to me; and I turn unto the  right or unto the left.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Laban answereth -- Bethuel also -- and they say, `The  thing hath gone out from Jehovah; we are not able to speak unto  thee bad or good;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>lo, Rebekah [is] before thee, take and go, and she is a  wife to thy lord`s son, as Jehovah hath spoken.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And it cometh to pass, when the servant of Abraham hath  heard their words, that he boweth himself towards the earth  before Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and the servant taketh out vessels of silver, and vessels  of gold, and garments, and giveth to Rebekah; precious things  also he hath given to her brother and to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they eat and drink, he and the men who [are] with him,  and lodge all night; and they rise in the morning, and he  saith, `Send me to my lord;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and her brother saith -- her mother also -- `Let the young  person abide with us a week or ten days, afterwards doth she  go.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And he saith unto them, `Do not delay me, seeing Jehovah  hath prospered my way; send me away, and I go to my lord;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and they say, `Let us call for the young person, and ask  at her mouth;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and they call for Rebekah, and say unto her, `Dost thou go  with this man?` and she saith, `I go.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they send away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse,  and Abraham`s servant, and his men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and they bless Rebekah, and say to her, `Thou [art] our  sister; become thou thousands of myriads, and thy seed doth  possess the gate of those hating it.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Rebekah and her young women arise, and ride on the  camels, and go after the man; and the servant taketh Rebekah  and goeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Isaac hath come in from the entrance of the Well of  the Living One, my Beholder; and he is dwelling in the land of  the south,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>and Isaac goeth out to meditate in the field, at the  turning of the evening, and he lifteth up his eyes, and  looketh, and lo, camels are coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Rebekah lifteth up her eyes, and seeth Isaac, and  alighteth from off the camel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>and she saith unto the servant, `Who [is] this man who is  walking in the field to meet us?` and the servant saith, `It  [is] my lord;` and she taketh the veil, and covereth herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And the servant recounteth to Isaac all the things that he  hath done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>and Isaac bringeth her in unto the tent of Sarah his  mother, and he taketh Rebekah, and she becometh his wife, and  he loveth her, and Isaac is comforted after [the death of] his  mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
