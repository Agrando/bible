for thou -- thou hast known my service which I  have served thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Laban saith unto him, `If, I pray thee, I have found  grace in thine eyes -- I have observed diligently that Jehovah  doth bless me for thy sake.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He saith also, `Define thy hire to me, and I give.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he saith unto him, `Thou -- thou hast known that which  I have served thee [in], and that which thy substance was with  me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for [it is] little which thou hast had at my appearance,  and it breaketh forth into a multitude, and Jehovah blesseth  thee at my coming; and now, when do I make, I also, for mine  own house?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he saith, `What do I give to thee?` And Jacob saith,  `Thou dost not give me anything; if thou do for me this thing,  I turn back; I have delight; thy flock I watch;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I pass through all thy flock to-day to turn aside from  thence every sheep speckled and spotted, and every brown sheep  among the lambs, and speckled and spotted among the goats --  and it hath been my hire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and my righteousness hath answered for me in the day to  come, when it cometh in for my hire before thy face; -- every  one which is not speckled and spotted among [my] goats, and  brown among [my] lambs -- it is stolen with me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Laban saith, `Lo, O that it were according to thy  word;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and he turneth aside during that day the ring-straked and  the spotted he-goats, and all the speckled and the spotted  she-goats, every one that [hath] white in it, and every brown  one among the lambs, and he giveth into the hand of his sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and setteth a journey of three days between himself and  Jacob; and Jacob is feeding the rest of the flock of Laban.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jacob taketh to himself a rod of fresh poplar, and of  the hazel and chesnut, and doth peel in them white peelings,  making bare the white that [is] on the rods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and setteth up the rods which he hath peeled in the  gutters in the watering troughs (when the flock cometh in to  drink), over-against the flock, that they may conceive in their  coming in to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the flocks conceive at the rods, and the flock beareth  ring-straked, speckled, and spotted ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the lambs hath Jacob parted, and he putteth the face  of the flock towards the ring-straked, also all the brown in  the flock of Laban, and he setteth his own droves by  themselves, and hath not set them near Laban`s flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it hath come to pass whenever the strong ones of the  flock conceive, that Jacob set the rods before the eyes of the  flock in the gutters, to cause them to conceive by the rods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and when the flock is feeble, he doth not set [them]; and  the feeble ones have been Laban`s, and the strong ones Jacob`s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the man increaseth very exceedingly, and hath many  flocks, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and  asses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
