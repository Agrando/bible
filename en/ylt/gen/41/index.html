only in the throne I am greater than thou.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `See, I have put thee over  all the land of Egypt.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Pharaoh turneth aside his seal-ring from off his hand,  and putteth it on the hand of Joseph, and clotheth him [with]  garments of fine linen, and placeth a chain of gold on his  neck,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and causeth him to ride in the second chariot which he  hath, and they proclaim before him, `Bow the knee!` and -- to  put him over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `I [am] Pharaoh, and  without thee a man doth not lift up his hand and his foot in  all the land of Egypt;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and Pharaoh calleth Joseph`s name Zaphnath-Paaneah, and he  giveth to him Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On,  for a wife, and Joseph goeth out over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Joseph [is] a son of thirty years in his standing  before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and Joseph goeth out from the  presence of Pharaoh, and passeth over through all the land of  Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and the land maketh in the seven years of plenty by  handfuls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he gathereth all the food of the seven years which  have been in the land of Egypt, and putteth food in the cities;  the food of the field which [is] round about [each] city hath  he put in its midst;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and Joseph gathereth corn as sand of the sea, multiplying  exceedingly, until that he hath ceased to number, for there is  no number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine  cometh, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On,  hath borne to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and Joseph calleth the name of the first-born Manasseh:  `for, God hath made me to forget all my labour, and all the  house of my father;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and the name of the second he hath called Ephraim: `for,  God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of mine  affliction.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the seven years of plenty are completed which have  been in the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and the seven years of famine begin to come, as Joseph  said, and famine is in all the lands, but in all the land of  Egypt hath been bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and all the land of Egypt is famished, and the people  crieth unto Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh saith to all the  Egyptians, `Go unto Joseph; that which he saith to you -- do.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And the famine has been over all the face of the land, and  Joseph openeth all [places] which have [corn] in them, and  selleth to the Egyptians; and the famine is severe in the land  of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and all the earth hath come to Egypt, to buy, unto Joseph,  for the famine was severe in all the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
