and he saith, `I [am] Joseph,  your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and now, be not grieved, nor let it be displeasing in your  eyes that ye sold me hither, for to preserve life hath God sent  me before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`Because these two years the famine [is] in the heart of  the land, and yet [are] five years, [in] which there is neither  ploughing nor harvest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and God sendeth me before you, to place of you a remnant in  the land, and to give life to you by a great escape;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and now, ye -- ye have not sent me hither, but God, and He  doth set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his  house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`Haste, and go up unto my father, then ye have said to him,  Thus said Joseph thy son, God hath set me for lord to all  Egypt; come down unto me, stay not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and thou hast dwelt in the land of Goshen, and been near  unto me, thou and thy sons, and thy son`s sons, and thy flock,  and thy herd, and all that thou hast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and I have nourished thee there -- for yet [are] five  years of famine -- lest thou become poor, thou and thy  household, and all that thou hast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And lo, your eyes are seeing, and the eyes of my brother  Benjamin, that [it is] my mouth which is speaking unto you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and ye have declared to my father all my honour in Egypt,  and all that ye have seen, and ye have hasted, and have brought  down my father hither.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he falleth on the neck of Benjamin his brother, and  weepeth, and Benjamin hath wept on his neck;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he kisseth all his brethren, and weepeth over them;  and afterwards have his brethren spoken with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sound hath been heard in the house of Pharaoh,  saying, `Come have the brethren of Joseph;` and it is good in  the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `Say unto thy brethren,  This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, enter ye the land of  Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and take your father, and your households, and come unto  me, and I give to you the good of the land of Egypt, and eat ye  the fat of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`Yea, thou -- thou hast been commanded: this do ye, take  for yourselves out of the land of Egypt, waggons for your  infants, and for your wives, and ye have brought your father,  and come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and your eye hath no pity on your vessels, for the good of  all the land of Egypt [is] yours.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Israel do so, and Joseph giveth waggons to  them by the command of Pharaoh, and he giveth to them provision  for the way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>to all of them hath he given -- to each changes of  garments, and to Benjamin he hath given three hundred  silverlings, and five changes of garments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and to his father he hath sent thus: ten asses bearing of  the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses bearing corn and  bread, even food for his father for the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he sendeth his brethren away, and they go; and he  saith unto them, `Be not angry in the way.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they go up out of Egypt, and come in to the land of  Canaan, unto Jacob their father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and they declare to him, saying, `Joseph [is] yet alive,`  and that he [is] ruler over all the land of Egypt; and his  heart ceaseth, for he hath not given credence to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they speak unto him all the words of Joseph, which he  hath spoken unto them, and he seeth the waggons which Joseph  hath sent to bear him away, and live doth the spirit of Jacob  their father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Israel saith, `Enough! Joseph my son [is] yet alive; I  go and see him before I die.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
