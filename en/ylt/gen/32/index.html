 and whither goest thou? and whose [are] these before thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>then thou hast said, Thy servant Jacob`s: it [is] a  present sent to my lord, to Esau; and lo, he also [is] behind  us.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he commandeth also the second, also the third, also  all who are going after the droves, saying, `According to this  manner do ye speak unto Esau in your finding him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and ye have said also, Lo, thy servant Jacob [is] behind  us;` for he said, `I pacify his face with the present which is  going before me, and afterwards I see his face; it may be he  lifteth up my face;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the present passeth over before his face, and he hath  lodged during that night in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he riseth in that night, and taketh his two wives, and  his two maid-servants, and his eleven children, and passeth  over the passage of Jabbok;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he taketh them, and causeth them to pass over the  brook, and he causeth that which he hath to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob is left alone, and one wrestleth with him till  the ascending of the dawn;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he seeth that he is not able for him, and he cometh  against the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob`s  thigh is disjointed in his wrestling with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and he saith, `Send me away, for the dawn hath ascended:`  and he saith, `I send thee not away, except thou hast blessed  me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he saith unto him, `What [is] thy name?` and he saith,  `Jacob.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he saith, `Thy name is no more called Jacob, but  Israel; for thou hast been a prince with God and with men, and  dost prevail.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob asketh, and saith, `Declare, I pray thee, thy  name;` and he saith, `Why [is] this, thou askest for My name?`  and He blesseth him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob calleth the name of the place Peniel: for `I  have seen God face unto face, and my life is delivered;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the sun riseth on him when he hath passed over Penuel,  and he is halting on his thigh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which  shrank, which [is] on the hollow of the thigh, unto this day,  because He came against the hollow of Jacob`s thigh, against  the sinew which shrank.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
