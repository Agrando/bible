in my  burying-place which I have prepared for myself in the land of  Canaan, there dost thou bury me; and now, let me go up, I pray  thee, and bury my father, and return;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and Pharaoh saith, `Go up and bury thy father, as he caused  thee to swear.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph goeth up to bury his father, and go up with him  do all the servants of Pharaoh, elders of his house, and all  the elders of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and the  house of his father; only their infants, and their flock, and  their herd, have they left in the land of Goshen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and there go up with him both chariot and horsemen, and the  camp is very great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they come unto the threshing-floor of Atad, which [is]  beyond the Jordan, and they lament there, a lamentation great  and very grievous; and he maketh for his father a mourning  seven days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the inhabitant of the land, the Canaanite, see the  mourning in the threshing-floor of Atad, and say, `A grievous  mourning [is] this to the Egyptians;` therefore hath [one]  called its name `The mourning of the Egyptians,` which [is]  beyond the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his sons do to him so as he commanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and his sons bear him away to the land of Canaan, and bury  him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought  with the field for a possession of a burying-place, from Ephron  the Hittite, on the front of Mamre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph turneth back to Egypt, he and his brethren, and  all who are going up with him to bury his father, after his  burying his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the brethren of Joseph see that their father is dead,  and say, `Peradventure Joseph doth hate us, and doth certainly  return to us all the evil which we did with him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they give a charge for Joseph, saying, `Thy father  commanded before his death, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus ye do say to Joseph, I pray thee, bear, I pray thee,  with the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for they  have done thee evil; and now, bear, we pray thee, with the  transgression of the servants of the God of thy father;` and  Joseph weepeth in their speaking unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his brethren also go and fall before him, and say,  `Lo, we [are] to thee for servants.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Joseph saith unto them, `Fear not, for [am] I in the  place of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for you, ye devised against me evil -- God devised it  for good, in order to do as [at] this day, to keep alive a  numerous people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and now, fear not: I do nourish you and your infants;` and  he comforteth them, and speaketh unto their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joseph dwelleth in Egypt, he and the house of his  father, and Joseph liveth a hundred and ten years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Joseph looketh on Ephraim`s sons of the third  [generation];
