if thou  art the Christ, tell us freely.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, `I told you, and ye do not believe;  the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify  concerning me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and  I know them, and they follow me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not  perish -- to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my  hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>my Father, who hath given to me, is greater than all, and  no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they  may stone him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, `Many good works did I shew you from  my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, saying, `For a good work we do not  stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a  man, dost make thyself God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, `Is it not having been written in  your law: I said, ye are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came,  (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the  world, do ye say -- Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of  God I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and if I do, even if me ye may not believe, the works  believe, that ye may know and may believe that in me [is] the  Father, and I in Him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he  went forth out of their hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to  the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained  there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and many came unto him, and said -- `John, indeed, did no  sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were  true;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and many did believe in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
