thus is every one who hath been born of the  Spirit.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said to him, `How are these things  able to happen?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to him, `Thou art the teacher of  Israel -- and these things thou dost not know!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`Verily, verily, I say to thee -- What we have known we  speak, and what we have seen we testify, and our testimony ye  do not receive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>if the earthly things I said to you, and ye do not believe,  how, if I shall say to you the heavenly things, will ye  believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and no one hath gone up to the heaven, except he who out of  the heaven came down -- the Son of Man who is in the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so  it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but  may have life age-during,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for God did so love the world, that His Son -- the only  begotten -- He gave, that every one who is believing in him  may not perish, but may have life age-during.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge  the world, but that the world may be saved through him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>he who is believing in him is not judged, but he who is not  believing hath been judged already, because he hath not  believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`And this is the judgment, that the light hath come to the  world, and men did love the darkness rather than the light,  for their works were evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for every one who is doing wicked things hateth the light,  and doth not come unto the light, that his works may not be  detected;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but he who is doing the truth doth come to the light, that  his works may be manifested, that in God they are having been  wrought.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land  of Judea, and there he did tarry with them, and was baptizing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and John was also baptizing in Aenon, nigh to Salem,  because there were many waters there, and they were coming and  were being baptized --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for John was not yet cast into the prison --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>there arose then a question from the disciples of John with  [some] Jews about purifying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and they came unto John, and said to him, `Rabbi, he who  was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou didst testify,  lo, this one is baptizing, and all are coming unto him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, `A man is not able to receive  anything, if it may not have been given him from the heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>ye yourselves do testify to me that I said, I am not the  Christ, but, that I am having been sent before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>he who is having the bride is bridegroom, and the friend of  the bridegroom, who is standing and hearing him, with joy doth  rejoice because of the voice of the bridegroom; this, then, my  joy hath been fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`Him it behoveth to increase, and me to become less;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he who from above is coming is above all; he who is from  the earth, from the earth he is, and from the earth he  speaketh; he who from the heaven is coming is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>`And what he hath seen and heard this he doth testify, and  his testimony none receiveth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he who is receiving his testimony did seal that God is  true;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>for he whom God sent, the sayings of God he speaketh; for  not by measure doth God give the Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the Father doth love the Son, and all things hath given  into his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>he who is believing in the Son, hath life age-during; and  he who is not believing the Son, shall not see life, but the  wrath of God doth remain upon him.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
