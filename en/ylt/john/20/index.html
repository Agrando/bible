whom dost  thou seek;` she, supposing that he is the gardener, saith to  him, `Sir, if thou didst carry him away, tell me where thou  didst lay him, and I will take him away;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus saith to her, `Mary!` having turned, she saith to  him, `Rabbouni;` that is to say, `Teacher.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus saith to her, `Be not touching me, for I have not  yet ascended unto my Father; and be going on to my brethren,  and say to them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and  to my God, and to your God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary the Magdalene cometh, telling to the disciples that  she hath seen the Lord, and [that] these things he said to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It being, therefore, evening, on that day, the first of  the sabbaths, and the doors having been shut where the  disciples were assembled, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came  and stood in the midst, and saith to them, `Peace to you;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and this having said, he shewed them his hands and side;  the disciples, therefore, rejoiced, having seen the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus, therefore, said to them again, `Peace to you;  according as the Father hath sent me, I also send you;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and this having said, he breathed on [them], and saith to  them, `Receive the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>if of any ye may loose the sins, they are loosed to them;  if of any ye may retain, they have been retained.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was  not with them when Jesus came;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the other disciples, therefore, said to him, `We have seen  the Lord;` and he said to them, `If I may not see in his hands  the mark of the nails, and may put my finger to the mark of the  nails, and may put my hand to his side, I will not believe.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after eight days, again were his disciples within, and  Thomas with them; Jesus cometh, the doors having been shut, and  he stood in the midst, and said, `Peace to you!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then he saith to Thomas, `Bring thy finger hither, and see  my hands, and bring thy hand, and put [it] to my side, and  become not unbelieving, but believing.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thomas answered and said to him, `My Lord and my God;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus saith to him, `Because thou hast seen me, Thomas,  thou hast believed; happy those not having seen, and having  believed.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Many indeed, therefore, other signs also did Jesus before  his disciples, that are not written in this book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and these have been written that ye may believe that Jesus  is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have  life in his name.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
