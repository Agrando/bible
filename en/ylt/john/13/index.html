and ye are  clean, but not all;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for he knew him who is delivering him up; because of this  he said, `Ye are not all clean.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When, therefore, he washed their feet, and took his  garments, having reclined (at meat) again, he said to them, `Do  ye know what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>ye call me, The Teacher and The Lord, and ye say well, for  I am;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if then I did wash your feet -- the Lord and the Teacher  -- ye also ought to wash one another`s feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`For an example I gave to you, that, according as I did to  you, ye also may do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>verily, verily, I say to you, a servant is not greater  than his lord, nor an apostle greater than he who sent him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>if these things ye have known, happy are ye, if ye may do  them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>not concerning you all do I speak; I have known whom I  chose for myself; but that the Writing may be fulfilled: He who  is eating the bread with me, did lift up against me his heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`From this time I tell you, before its coming to pass,  that, when it may come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>verily, verily, I say to you, he who is receiving  whomsoever I may send, doth receive me; and he who is receiving  me, doth receive Him who sent me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These things having said, Jesus was troubled in the  spirit, and did testify, and said, `Verily, verily, I say to  you, that one of you will deliver me up;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>the disciples were looking, therefore, one at another,  doubting concerning whom he speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there was one of his disciples reclining (at meat) in  the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus was loving;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter, then, doth beckon to this one, to inquire who  he may be concerning whom he speaketh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and that one having leant back on the breast of Jesus,  respondeth to him, `Sir, who is it?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answereth, `That one it is to whom I, having dipped  the morsel, shall give it;` and having dipped the morsel, he  giveth [it] to Judas of Simon, Iscariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the morsel, then the Adversary entered into that  one, Jesus, therefore, saith to him, `What thou dost -- do  quickly;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and none of those reclining at meat knew for what intent  he said this to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for certain were thinking, since Judas had the bag, that  Jesus saith to him, `Buy what we have need of for the feast;`  or that he may give something to the poor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having received, therefore, the morsel, that one  immediately went forth, and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When, therefore, he went forth, Jesus saith, `Now was the  Son of Man glorified, and God was glorified in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>if God was glorified in him, God also will glorify him in  Himself; yea, immediately He will glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>`Little children, yet a little am I with you; ye will seek  me, and, according as I said to the Jews -- Whither I go away,  ye are not able to come, to you also I do say [it] now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>`A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one  another; according as I did love you, that ye also love one  another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>in this shall all know that ye are my disciples, if ye may  have love one to another.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter saith to him, `Sir, whither dost thou go  away?` Jesus answered him, `Whither I go away, thou art not  able now to follow me, but afterward thou shalt follow me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter saith to him, `Sir, wherefore am I not able to  follow thee now? my life for thee I will lay down;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, `Thy life for me thou wilt lay down!  verily, verily, I say to thee, a cock will not crow till thou  mayest deny me thrice.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
