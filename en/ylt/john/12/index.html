for the day of my  embalming she hath kept it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for the poor ye have always with yourselves, and me ye have  not always.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A great multitude, therefore, of the Jews knew that he is  there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that  Lazarus also they may see, whom he raised out of the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the chief priests took counsel, that also Lazarus they  may kill,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because on account of him many of the Jews were going  away, and were believing in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the morrow, a great multitude that came to the feast,  having heard that Jesus doth come to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>took the branches of the palms, and went forth to meet  him, and were crying, `Hosanna, blessed [is] he who is coming  in the name of the Lord -- the king of Israel;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and Jesus having found a young ass did sit upon it,  according as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`Fear not, daughter of Sion, lo, thy king doth come,  sitting on an ass` colt.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these things his disciples did not know at the first,  but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these  things were having been written about him, and these things  they did to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The multitude, therefore, who are with him, were  testifying that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and did  raise him out of the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because of this also did the multitude meet him, because  they heard of his having done this sign,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, `Ye see  that ye do not gain anything, lo, the world did go after him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there were certain Greeks out of those coming up that  they may worship in the feast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>these then came near to Philip, who [is] from Bethsaida of  Galilee, and were asking him, saying, `Sir, we wish to see  Jesus;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew, and again Andrew and  Philip tell Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus responded to them, saying, `The hour hath come  that the Son of Man may be glorified;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>verily, verily, I say to you, if the grain of the wheat,  having fallen to the earth, may not die, itself remaineth  alone; and if it may die, it doth bear much fruit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>he who is loving his life shall lose it, and he who is  hating his life in this world -- to life age-during shall keep  it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>if any one may minister to me, let him follow me, and  where I am, there also my ministrant shall be; and if any one  may minister to me -- honour him will the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>`Now hath my soul been troubled, and what? shall I say --  Father, save me from this hour? -- but because of this I came  to this hour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify Thy name.` There came, therefore, a voice  out of the heaven, `I both glorified, and again I will glorify  [it];`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>the multitude, therefore, having stood and heard, were  saying that there hath been thunder; others said, `A messenger  hath spoken to him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, `Not because of me hath this  voice come, but because of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>now is a judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of  this world be cast forth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and I, if I may be lifted up from the earth, will draw all  men unto myself.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And this he said signifying by what death he was about to  die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the multitude answered him, `We heard out of the law that  the Christ doth remain -- to the age; and how dost thou say,  That it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up? who is this  -- the Son of Man?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus, therefore, said to them, `Yet a little time is the  light with you; walk while ye have the light, that darkness  may not overtake you; and he who is walking in the darkness  hath not known where he goeth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>while ye have the light, believe in the light, that sons  of light ye may become.` These things spake Jesus, and having  gone away, he was hid from them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>yet he having done so many signs before them, they were  not believing in him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,  which he said, `Lord, who gave credence to our report? and the  arm of the Lord -- to whom was it revealed?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Because of this they were not able to believe, that again  Isaiah said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>`He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart,  that they might not see with the eyes, and understand with the  heart, and turn back, and I might heal them;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>these things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake  of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Still, however, also out of the rulers did many believe in  him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing,  that they might not be put out of the synagogue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of  God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jesus cried and said, `He who is believing in me, doth  not believe in me, but in Him who sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and he who is beholding me, doth behold Him who sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I a light to the world have come, that every one who is  believing in me -- in the darkness may not remain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and if any one may hear my sayings, and not believe, I --  I do not judge him, for I came not that I might judge the  world, but that I might save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>`He who is rejecting me, and not receiving my sayings,  hath one who is judging him, the word that I spake, that will  judge him in the last day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>because I spake not from myself, but the Father who sent  me, He did give me a command, what I may say, and what I may  speak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and I have known that His command is life age-during;  what, therefore, I speak, according as the Father hath said to  me, so I speak.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
