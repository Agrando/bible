he who is remaining in me,  and I in him, this one doth bear much fruit, because apart from  me ye are not able to do anything;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>if any one may not remain in me, he was cast forth without  as the branch, and was withered, and they gather them, and  cast to fire, and they are burned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>if ye may remain in me, and my sayings in you may remain,  whatever ye may wish ye shall ask, and it shall be done to  you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`In this was my Father glorified, that ye may bear much  fruit, and ye shall become my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>According as the Father did love me, I also loved you,  remain in my love;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>if my commandments ye may keep, ye shall remain in my  love, according as I the commands of my Father have kept, and  do remain in His love;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>these things I have spoken to you, that my joy in you may  remain, and your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`This is my command, that ye love one another, according  as I did love you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>greater love than this hath no one, that any one his life  may lay down for his friends;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>ye are my friends, if ye may do whatever I command you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>no more do I call you servants, because the servant hath  not known what his lord doth, and you I have called friends,  because all things that I heard from my Father, I did make  known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`Ye did not choose out me, but I chose out you, and did  appoint you, that ye might go away, and might bear fruit, and  your fruit might remain, that whatever ye may ask of the Father  in my name, He may give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`These things I command you, that ye love one another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>if the world doth hate you, ye know that it hath hated me  before you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>if of the world ye were, the world its own would have been  loving, and because of the world ye are not -- but I chose out  of the world -- because of this the world hateth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>`Remember the word that I said to you, A servant is not  greater than his lord; if me they did persecute, you also they  will persecute; if my word they did keep, yours also they will  keep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but all these things will they do to you, because of my  name, because they have not known Him who sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>if I had not come and spoken to them, they were not having  sin; but now pretext they have not for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`He who is hating me, doth hate also my Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>if I did not do among them the works that no other hath  done, they were not having sin, and now they have both seen  and hated both me and my Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but -- that the word may be fulfilled that was written in  their law -- They hated me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And when the Comforter may come, whom I will send to you  from the Father -- the Spirit of truth, who from the Father  doth come forth, he will testify of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and ye also do testify, because from the beginning ye are  with me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
