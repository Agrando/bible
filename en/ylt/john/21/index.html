thou hast known that I dearly love  thee;` he saith to him, `Feed my lambs.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He saith to him again, a second time, `Simon, [son] of  Jonas, dost thou love me?` he saith to him, `Yes, Lord; thou  hast known that I dearly love thee;` he saith to him, `Tend my  sheep.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He saith to him the third time, `Simon, [son] of Jonas,  dost thou dearly love me?` Peter was grieved that he said to  him the third time, `Dost thou dearly love me?` and he said to  him, `Lord, thou hast known all things; thou dost know that I  dearly love thee.` Jesus saith to him, `Feed my sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast younger,  thou wast girding thyself and wast walking whither thou didst  will, but when thou mayest be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy  hands, and another will gird thee, and shall carry [thee]  whither thou dost not will;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and this he said, signifying by what death he shall  glorify God; and having said this, he saith to him, `Be  following me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Peter having turned about doth see the disciple whom  Jesus was loving following, (who also reclined in the supper on  his breast, and said, `Sir, who is he who is delivering thee  up?`)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter having seen this one, saith to Jesus, `Lord, and  what of this one?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus saith to him, `If him I will to remain till I come,  what -- to thee? be thou following me.` This word, therefore,  went forth to the brethren that that disciple doth not die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>yet Jesus did not say to him, that he doth not die, but,  `If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to thee?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these  things, and he wrote these things, and we have known that his  testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus  did -- which, if they may be written one by one, not even the  world itself I think to have place for the books written.  Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
