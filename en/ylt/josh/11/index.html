their horses thou dost hough, and their  chariots burn with fire.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joshua cometh, and all the people of war with him,  against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fall on  them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Jehovah giveth them into the hand of Israel, and they  smite them and pursue them unto the great Zidon, and unto  Misrephoth-Maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward, and  they smite them, till he hath not left to them a remnant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and Joshua doth to them as Jehovah said to him; their  horses he hath houghed, and their chariots burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua turneth back at that time, and captureth Hazor,  and its king he hath smitten by the sword; for Hazor formerly  [is] head of all these kingdoms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they smite every person who [is] in it by the mouth of  the sword; he hath devoted -- he hath not left any one  breathing, and Hazor he hath burnt with fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and all the cities of these kings, and all their kings,  hath Joshua captured, and he smiteth them by the mouth of the  sword; he devoted them, as Moses, servant of Jehovah,  commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Only, all the cities which are standing by their hill,  Israel hath not burned them, save Hazor only, [it] hath Joshua  burnt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, have  the sons of Israel spoiled for themselves; only, every human  being they have smitten by the mouth of the sword, till their  destroying them; they have not left any one breathing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As Jehovah commanded Moses His servant, so did Moses  command Joshua, and so hath Joshua done; he hath not turned  aside a thing of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joshua taketh all this land: the hill-country, and all  the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the low country, and  the plain, even the hill-country of Israel and its low lands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>from the mount of Halak, which is going up [to] Seir, and  unto Baal-Gad, in the valley of Lebanon, under mount Hermon;  and all their kings he hath captured, and he smiteth them, and  putteth them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Many days hath Joshua made with all these kings war;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>there hath not been a city which made peace with the sons  of Israel save the Hivite, inhabitants of Gibeon; the whole  they have taken in battle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for from Jehovah it hath been to strengthen their heart,  to meet in battle with Israel, in order to devote them, so that  they have no grace, but in order to destroy them, as Jehovah  commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Joshua cometh at that time, and cutteth off the Anakim  from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, even  from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country  of Israel; with their cities hath Joshua devoted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There hath not been left Anakim in the land of the sons of  Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, were they left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joshua taketh the whole of the land, according to all  that Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses, and Joshua giveth it for  an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions, by their  tribes; and the land hath rest from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
