I have not known whither the  men have gone; pursue ye, hasten after them, for ye overtake  them;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and she hath caused them to go up on the roof, and hideth  them with the flax wood, which is arranged for her on the roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men have pursued after them the way of the Jordan,  by the fords, and the gate they have shut afterwards, when the  pursuers have gone out after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And -- before they lie down -- she hath gone up unto them on  the roof,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and she saith unto the men, `I have known that Jehovah hath  given to you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon  us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted at  your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the  Red Sea at your presence, in your going out of Egypt, and that  which ye have done to the two kings of the Amorite who [are]  beyond the Jordan; to Sihon and to Og whom ye devoted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And we hear, and melt doth our heart, and there hath not  stood any more spirit in [any] man, from your presence, for  Jehovah your God, He [is] God in the heavens above, and on the  earth beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And now, swear ye, I pray you, to me by Jehovah -- because  I have done with you kindness -- that ye have done, even ye,  kindness with the house of my father, and have given to me a  true token,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and have kept alive my father, and my mother, and my  brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and have  delivered our souls from death.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the men say to her, `Our soul for yours -- to die; if  ye declare not this our matter, then it hath been, in Jehovah`s  giving to us this land, that we have done with thee kindness  and truth.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she causeth them to go down by a rope through the  window, for her house [is] in the side of the wall, and in the  wall she [is] dwelling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and she saith to them, `To the mountain go, lest the  pursuers come upon you; and ye have been hidden there three  days till the turning back of the pursuers, and afterwards ye  go on your way.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men say unto her, `We are acquitted of this thine  oath which thou hast caused us to swear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>lo, we are coming into the land, this line of scarlet  thread thou dost bind to the window by which thou hast caused  us to go down, and thy father, and thy mother, and thy  brethren, and all the house of thy father thou dost gather unto  thee, to the house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and it hath been, any one who goeth out from the doors of  thy house without, his blood [is] on his head, and we are  innocent; and any one who is with thee in the house, his blood  [is] on our head, if a hand is on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and if thou declare this our matter, then we have been  acquitted from thine oath which thou hast caused us to swear.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she saith, `According unto your words, so it [is];` and  she sendeth them away, and they go; and she bindeth the scarlet  line to the window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they go, and come in to the mountain, and abide there  three days until the pursuers have turned back; and the  pursuers seek in all the way, and have not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the two men turn back, and come down from the hill, and  pass over, and come in unto Joshua son of Nun, and recount to  him all that hath come upon them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they say unto Joshua, `Surely Jehovah hath given into  our hand all the land; and also, all the inhabitants of the  land have melted at our presence.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
