thus thou dost six days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee  before the ark, and on the seventh day ye compass the city  seven times, and the priests blow with the trumpets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and it hath been, in the prolongation of the horn of the  jubilee, in your hearing the voice of the trumpet,  all the people shout -- a great shout, and the wall of the  city hath fallen under it, and the people have gone up, each  over-against him.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua son of Nun calleth unto the priests, and saith  unto them, `Bear ye the ark of the covenant, and seven priests  do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of  Jehovah;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and He said unto the people, `Pass over, and compass the  city, and he who is armed doth pass over before the ark of  Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it cometh to pass, when Joshua speaketh unto the people,  that the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee  before Jehovah have passed over and blown with the trumpets,  and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is going after them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he who is armed is going before the priests blowing the  trumpets, and he who is gathering up is going after the ark,  going on and blowing with the trumpets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the people hath Joshua commanded, saying, `Ye do not  shout, nor cause your voice to be heard, nor doth there go out  from your mouth a word, till the day of my saying unto you,  Shout ye -- then ye have shouted.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the ark of Jehovah doth compass the city, going round  once, and they come into the camp, and lodge in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and the priests  bear the ark of Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee  before the ark of Jehovah are walking, going on, and they have  blown with the trumpets -- and he who is armed is going before  them, and he who is gathering up is going behind  the ark of Jehovah -- going on and blowing with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they compass the city on the second day once, and turn  back to the camp; thus they have done six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it cometh to pass, on the seventh day, that they rise  early, at the ascending of the dawn, and compass the city,  according to this manner, seven times; (only, on that day they  have compassed the city seven times);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and it cometh to pass, at the seventh time, the priests  have blown with the trumpets, and Joshua saith unto the people,  `Shout ye, for Jehovah hath given to you the city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the city hath been devoted, it and all that [is] in it,  to Jehovah; only Rahab the harlot doth live, she and all who  [are] with her in the house, for she hid the messengers whom we  sent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and surely ye have kept from the devoted thing, lest ye  devote [yourselves], and have taken from the devoted thing, and  have made the camp of Israel become a devoted thing, and have  troubled it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,  holy they [are] to Jehovah; into the treasury of Jehovah they  come.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the people shout, and blow with the trumpets, and it  cometh to pass when the people hear the voice of the trumpet,  that the people shout -- a great shout, and the wall falleth  under it, and the people goeth up into the city, each  over-against him, and they capture the city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they devote all that [is] in the city, from man even  unto woman, from young even unto aged, even unto ox, and sheep,  and ass, by the mouth of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And to the two men who are spying the land Joshua said, `Go  into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out thence  the woman, and all whom she hath, as ye have sworn to her.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the young man, the spies, go in and bring out Rahab,  and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all whom  she hath; yea, all her families they have brought out, and  place them at the outside of the camp of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the city they have burnt with fire, and all that [is]  in it; only, the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass,  and of iron, they have given [to] the treasury of the house of  Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father, and all  whom she hath, hath Joshua kept alive; and she dwelleth in the  midst of Israel unto this day, for she hid the messengers whom  Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua adjureth [them] at that time, saying, `Cursed  [is] the man before Jehovah who raiseth up and hath built this  city, [even] Jericho; in his first-born he doth lay its  foundation, and in his youngest he doth set up its doors;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and Jehovah is with Joshua, and his fame is in all the  land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
