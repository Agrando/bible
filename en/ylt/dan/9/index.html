and its end [is] with a flood,  and till the end [is] war, determined [are] desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he hath strengthened a covenant with many -- one week,  and [in] the midst of the week he causeth sacrifice and present  to cease, and by the wing of abominations he is making  desolate, even till the consummation, and that which is  determined is poured on the desolate one.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
