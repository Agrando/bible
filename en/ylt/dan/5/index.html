the herb like oxen they cause him to eat, and by the  dew of the heavens is his body wet, till that he hath known  that God Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and whom He  willeth He raiseth up over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And thou, his son, Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart,  though all this thou hast known;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and against the Lord of the heavens thou hast lifted up  thyself;
