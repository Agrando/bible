And they come in and stand before the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the king saith to them, `A dream I have dreamed, and  moved is my spirit to know the dream.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Chaldeans speak to the king [in] Aramaean, `O king,  to the ages live, tell the dream to thy servants, and the  interpretation we do shew.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The king hath answered and said to the Chaldeans, `The thing  from me is gone; if ye do not cause me to know the dream and  its interpretation, pieces ye are made, and your houses are  made dunghills;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and if the dream and its interpretation ye do shew, gifts,  and fee, and great glory ye receive from before me, therefore  the dream and its interpretation shew ye me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have answered a second time, and are saying, `Let the  king tell the dream to his servants, and the interpretation we  do shew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The king hath answered and said, `Of a truth I know that  time ye are gaining, because that ye have seen that the thing  is gone from me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[so] that, if the dream ye do not cause me to know -- one is  your sentence, seeing a word lying and corrupt ye have prepared  to speak before me, till that the time is changed, therefore  the dream tell ye to me, then do I know that its interpretation  ye do shew me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Chaldeans have answered before the king, and are  saying, `There is not a man on the earth who is able to shew  the king`s matter; therefore, no king, chief, and ruler, hath  asked such a thing as this of any scribe, and enchanter, and  Chaldean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the thing that the king is asking [is] precious, and  others are there not that do shew it before the king, save the  gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore the king hath been angry and very wroth, and hath  said to destroy all the wise men of Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sentence hath gone forth, and the wise men are  being slain, and they have sought Daniel and his companions to  be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Daniel hath replied [with] counsel and discretion to  Arioch chief of the executioners of the king, who hath gone  forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He hath answered and said to Arioch the king`s captain,  `Wherefore [is] the sentence so urgent from before the king?`  Then Arioch hath made the thing known to Daniel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Daniel hath gone up, and sought of the king that he  would give him time to shew the interpretation to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Daniel to his house hath gone, and to Hananiah,  Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, he hath made the thing  known,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and to seek mercies from before the God of the heavens  concerning this secret, that they destroy not Daniel and his  companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then to Daniel, in a vision of the night, the secret hath  been revealed.
