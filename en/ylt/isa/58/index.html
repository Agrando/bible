We have  afflicted our soul, and Thou knowest not.` Lo, in the day of  your fast ye find pleasure, And all your labours ye exact.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lo, for strife and debate ye fast, And to smite with the  fist of wickedness, Ye fast not as [to]-day, To sound in the high  place your voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Like this is the fast that I choose? The day of a man`s  afflicting his soul? To bow as a reed his head, And sackcloth  and ashes spread out? This dost thou call a fast, And a  desirable day -- to Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not this the fast that I chose -- To loose the bands of  wickedness, To shake off the burdens of the yoke, And to send  out the oppressed free, And every yoke ye draw off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is it not to deal to the hungry thy bread, And the mourning  poor bring home, That thou seest the naked and cover him, And  from thine own flesh hide not thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then broken up as the dawn is thy light, And thy health in  haste springeth up, Gone before thee hath thy righteousness,  The honour of Jehovah doth gather thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then thou callest, and Jehovah answereth, Thou criest, and  He saith, `Behold Me.` If thou turn aside from thy midst the  yoke, The sending forth of the finger, And the speaking of  vanity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And dost bring out to the hungry thy soul, And the  afflicted soul dost satisfy, Then risen in the darkness hath  thy light, And thy thick darkness [is] as noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah doth lead thee continually, And hath satisfied  in drought thy soul, And thy bones He armeth, And thou hast  been as a watered garden, And as an outlet of waters, whose  waters lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they have built out of thee the wastes of old, The  foundations of many generations thou raisest up, And one  calleth thee, `Repairer of the breach, Restorer of paths to  rest in.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If thou dost turn from the sabbath thy foot, Doing thine  own pleasure on My holy day, And hast cried to the sabbath, `A  delight,` To the holy of Jehovah, `Honoured,` And hast honoured  it, without doing thine own ways, Without finding thine own  pleasure, And speaking a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then dost thou delight thyself on Jehovah, And I have  caused thee to ride on high places of earth, And have caused  thee to eat the inheritance of Jacob thy father, For the mouth  of Jehovah hath spoken!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
