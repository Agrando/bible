And at desolation?  -- from afar it cometh. Near whom do ye flee for help? And  where do ye leave your honour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Without Me it hath bowed down In the place of a bound one,  And in the place of the slain they fall. With all this not  turned back hath His anger, And still His hand is stretched  out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wo [to] Asshur, a rod of Mine anger, And a staff in their  hand [is] Mine indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Against a profane nation I send him, And concerning a  people of My wrath I charge him, To spoil spoil, and to seize  prey, And to make it a treading-place as the clay of out  places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he -- he thinketh not so, And his heart reckoneth not  so, For -- to destroy [is] in his heart, And to cut off nations  not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he saith, `Are not my princes altogether kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not Calno as Carchemish?

And  concerning the glory of the height of his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he hath said, `By the power of my hand I have wrought,  And by my wisdom, for I have been intelligent, And I remove  borders of the peoples, And their chief ones I have spoiled,  And I put down as a mighty one the inhabitants,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And my hand as to a nest Getteth to the wealth of the  peoples, And as a gathering of forsaken eggs All the earth I --  I have gathered, And there hath not been one moving wing, Or  opening mouth, or whispering.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>-- Doth the axe glorify itself Against him who is hewing  with it?
