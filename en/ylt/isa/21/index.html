Go up, O Elam, besiege, O Media, All its sighing I  have caused to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore filled have been my loins [with] great pain,  Pangs have seized me as pangs of a travailing woman, I have  been bent down by hearing, I have been troubled by seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wandered hath my heart, trembling hath terrified me, The  twilight of my desire He hath made a fear to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Arrange the table, watch in the watch-tower, Eat, drink,  rise, ye heads, anoint the shield,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus said the Lord unto me: `Go, station the watchman,  That which he seeth let him declare.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he hath seen a chariot -- a couple of horsemen, The  rider of an ass, the rider of a camel, And he hath given  attention -- He hath increased attention!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he crieth -- a lion, `On a watch-tower my lord, I am  standing continually by day, And on my ward I am stationed  whole nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And lo, this, the chariot of a man is coming, A couple of  horsemen.` And he answereth and saith: `Fallen, fallen hath  Babylon, And all the graven images of her gods He hath broken  to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my threshing, and the son of my floor, That which I  heard from Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, I have declared to  you!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah.
