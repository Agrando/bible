Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, For it hath  been destroyed, Without house, without entrance, From the land  of Chittim it was revealed to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Be silent, ye inhabitants of the isle, Trader of Zidon,  passing the sea, they filled thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in many waters [is] the seed of Sihor, The harvest of  the brook [is] her increase, And she is a mart of nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Be ashamed, O Zidon; for the sea spake, The strength of the  sea, saying: `I have not been pained, nor have I brought forth,  Nor have I nourished young men, [nor] brought up virgins.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As [at] the report of Egypt they are pained, So [at] the  report of Tyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pass over to Tarshish, howl, ye inhabitants of the isle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is this your exulting one? From the days of old [is] her  antiquity, Carry her do her own feet afar off to sojourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who hath counselled this against Tyre, The crowning one,  whose traders [are] princes, Her merchants the honoured of  earth?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehovah of Hosts hath counselled it, To pollute the  excellency of all beauty, To make light all the honoured of  earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pass through thy land as a brook, Daughter of Tarshish,  there is no more a girdle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His hand He hath stretched out over the sea, He hath  caused kingdoms to tremble, Jehovah hath charged concerning the  merchant one, To destroy her strong places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He saith, `Thou dost not add any more to exult, O  oppressed one, virgin daughter of Zidon, To Chittim arise, pass  over, Even there -- there is no rest for thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Lo, the land of the Chaldeans -- this people was not,  Asshur founded it for the Ziim, They raised its watch-towers,  They lifted up her palaces, -- He hath appointed her for a  ruin!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, For your strength hath been  destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it hath come to pass, in that day, That forgotten is  Tyre seventy years, According to the days of one king.
