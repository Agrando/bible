As a man of war He  stirreth up zeal, He crieth, yea, He shrieketh, Against His  enemies He showeth Himself mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have kept silent from of old, I keep silent, I refrain  myself, As a travailing woman I cry out, I desolate and swallow  up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I make waste mountains and hills, And all their herbs I  dry up, And I have made rivers become isles, And ponds I dry  up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have caused the blind to go, In a way they have not  known, In paths they have not known I cause them to tread, I  make a dark place before them become light, And unlevelled  places become a plain, These [are] the things I have done to  them, And I have not forsaken them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Removed backward -- utterly ashamed, Are those trusting in  a graven image, Those saying to a molten image, `Ye [are] our  gods.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Ye deaf, hear; and ye blind, look to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who [is] blind but My servant?

Who [is] blind as he who is at peace, Yea, blind, as the  servant of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Seeing many things, and thou observest not, Opening ears,  and he heareth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah hath delight for the sake of His righteousness, He  magnifieth law, and maketh honourable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And this [is] a people seized and spoiled, Snared in holes  -- all of them, And in houses of restraint they were hidden,  They have been for a prey, And there is no deliverer, A spoil,  and none is saying, `Restore.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who among you giveth ear [to] this? Attendeth, and heareth  afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who hath given Jacob for a spoil, And Israel to the  spoilers? Is it not Jehovah -- He against whom we sinned? Yea,  they have not been willing in His ways to walk, Nor have they  hearkened to His law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He poureth on him fury, His anger, and the strength of  battle, And it setteth him on fire round about, And he hath not  known, And it burneth against him, and he layeth it not to  heart!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
