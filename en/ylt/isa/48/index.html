I have caused thee to hear new things from this time,  And things reserved that ye knew not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they have been produced and not from that time, Yea,  before the day, and thou hast not heard them, Lest thou say,  `Lo, I have known them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, thou hast not heard, Yea, thou hast not known, Yea,  from that time not opened hath thine ear, For I have known thou  dealest treacherously, And `Transgressor from the belly,` One  is crying to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For My name`s sake I defer Mine anger, And My praise I  restrain for thee, So as not to cut thee off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Lo, I have refined thee, and not with silver, I have  chosen thee in a furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For My sake, for Mine own sake, I do [it], For how is it  polluted?
