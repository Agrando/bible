And Jehovah seeth, and it is  evil in His eyes, That there is no judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He seeth that there is no man, And is astonished that  there is no intercessor, And His own arm giveth salvation to  Him, And His righteousness -- it sustained Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He putteth on righteousness as a breastplate, And an  helmet of salvation on His head, And He putteth on garments of  vengeance [for] clothing, And is covered, as [with] an  upper-robe, [with] zeal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to deeds -- so He repayeth. Fury to His  adversaries, [their] deed to His enemies, To the isles [their]  deed He repayeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they fear from the west the name of Jehovah, And from  the rising of the sun -- His honour, When come in as a flood  doth an adversary, The Spirit of Jehovah hath raised an ensign  against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And come to Zion hath a redeemer, Even to captives of  transgression in Jacob, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I -- this [is] My covenant with them, said Jehovah, My  Spirit that [is] on thee, And My words that I have put in thy  mouth, Depart not from thy mouth, And from the mouth of thy  seed, And from the mouth of thy seed`s seed, said Jehovah, From  henceforth unto the age!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
