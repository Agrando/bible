Its rulers cause howling,  -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And continually all the day My  name is despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore doth My people know My name, Therefore, in that  day, Surely I [am] He who is speaking, behold Me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How comely on the mountains, Have been the feet of one  proclaiming tidings, Sounding peace, proclaiming good tidings,  Sounding salvation, Saying to Zion, `Reigned hath thy God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The voice of thy watchmen! They have lifted up the voice,  together they cry aloud, Because eye to eye they see, in  Jehovah`s turning back [to] Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Break forth, sing together, O wastes of Jerusalem, For  Jehovah hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah hath made bare His holy arm Before the eyes of all  the nations, And seen have all the ends of the earth, The  salvation of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Turn aside, turn aside, go out thence, The unclean touch  not, go out from her midst, Be ye pure, who are bearing the  weapons of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For not in haste do ye go out, Yea, with flight ye go not  on, For going before you [is] Jehovah, And gathering you [is]  the God of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Lo, My servant doth act wisely, He is high, and hath been  lifted up, And hath been very high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As astonished at thee have been many, (So marred by man  his appearance, And his form by sons of men.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So doth he sprinkle many nations. Concerning him kings  shut their mouth, For that which was not recounted to them they  have seen, And that which they had not heard they have  understood!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
