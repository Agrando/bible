Lo, Jehovah is riding on a swift thick  cloud, And He hath entered Egypt, And moved have been the idols  of Egypt at His presence, And the heart of Egypt melteth in its  midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I armed Egyptians against Egyptians, And they fought,  each against his brother, And each against his neighbour, City  against city, kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And emptied out hath been in its midst the spirit of Egypt.  And its counsel I swallow up, And they have sought unto the  idols, And unto the charmers, And unto those having familiar  spirits, And unto the wizards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I have delivered the Egyptians Into the hand of a hard  lord, And a strong king doth rule over them, An affirmation of  the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And failed have waters from the sea, And a river is wasted  and dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they have turned away the flowings, Weak and dried up  have been brooks of the bulwark, Reed and flag have withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Exposed things by the brook, by the edge of the brook, And  every sown thing of the brook, hath withered, It hath been  driven away, and is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And lamented have the fishers, And mourned have all casting  angle into a brook, And those spreading nets on the face of the  waters have languished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And ashamed have been makers of fine flax, And weavers of  net-works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And its foundations have been smitten, All making wages  [are] afflicted in soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Only, fools [are] the princes of Zoan, The counsel of the  wise ones of the counsellors of Pharaoh hath become brutish.  How say ye unto Pharaoh, `A son of the wise am I, a son of  kings of antiquity?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Where [are] they now, thy wise ones? Yea, let them tell to  thee, I pray thee, And they know what Jehovah of Hosts hath  counselled against Egypt!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Foolish have been princes of Zoan, Lifted up have been  princes of Noph, And they have caused Egypt to err, The chief  of her tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah hath mingled in her midst A spirit of  perverseness, And they have caused Egypt to err in all its  work, As a drunkard erreth in his vomit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there is no work to Egypt, That head or tail, branch  or reed, may do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In that day is Egypt like women, And it hath mourned, and  been afraid, Because of the waving of the hand of Jehovah of  Hosts, That He is waving over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the land of Judah hath been to Egypt for a cause of  staggering, Every one who doth mention it, for himself feareth,  Because of the counsel of Jehovah of Hosts, That He is  counselling against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day there are five cities in the land of Egypt,  Speaking the lip of Canaan, And swearing to Jehovah of Hosts,  `The city of destruction,` is said of one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In that day there is an altar to Jehovah In the midst of  the land of Egypt, And a standing pillar near its border to  Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it hath been for a sign and for a testimony, To  Jehovah of Hosts in the land of Egypt, For they cry unto  Jehovah from the face of oppressors, And He sendeth to them a  saviour, Even a great one, and hath delivered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And known hath been Jehovah to Egypt, And the Egyptians  have known Jehovah in that day, And done sacrifice and present,  And vowed a vow to Jehovah, and completed [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah hath smitten Egypt, smiting and healing, And  they have turned back unto Jehovah, And He hath been entreated  of them, And hath healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day is a highway out of Egypt to Asshur, And come  in have the Assyrians to Egypt, And the Egyptians into Asshur,  And the Egyptians have served with the Assyrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In that day is Israel third, After Egypt, and after  Asshur, A blessing in the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In that Jehovah of Hosts did bless it, saying, `Blessed  [is] My people -- Egypt, And the work of My hands -- Asshur,  And Mine inheritance -- Israel!`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
