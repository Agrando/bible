They have forsaken Jehovah,  They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have gone away  backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore are ye stricken any more? Ye do add apostacy!  Every head is become diseased, and every heart [is] sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot -- unto the head, There is no  soundness in it, Wound, and bruise, and fresh smiting! They  have not been closed nor bound, Nor have they softened with  ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your land [is] a desolation, your cities burnt with fire,  Your ground, before you strangers are consuming it, And a  desolation as overthrown by strangers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And left hath been the daughter of Zion, As a booth in a  vineyard, As a lodge in a place of cucumbers -- as a city  besieged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Unless Jehovah of Hosts had left to us a remnant, Shortly --  as Sodom we had been, To Gomorrah we had been like!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom, Give ear to  the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`Why to Me the abundance of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah,  I have been satiated [with] burnt-offerings of rams, And fat of  fatlings; And blood of bullocks, and lambs, And he-goats I have  not desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When ye come in to appear before Me, Who hath required this  of your hand, To trample My courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Add not to bring in a vain present, Incense -- an  abomination it [is] to Me, New moon, and sabbath, calling of  convocation! Rendure not iniquity -- and a restraint!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your set seasons hath My soul hated,  They have been upon me for a burden, I have been weary of  bearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in your spreading forth your hands, I hide mine eyes  from you, Also when ye increase prayer, I do not hear, Your  hands of blood have been full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash ye, make ye pure, Turn aside the evil of your doings,  from before Mine eyes, Cease to do evil, learn to do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Seek judgment, make happy the oppressed, Judge the  fatherless, strive [for] the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come, I pray you, and we reason, saith Jehovah, If your  sins are as scarlet, as snow they shall be white, If they are  red as crimson, as wool they shall be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye are willing, and have hearkened, The good of the land  ye consume,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if ye refuse, and have rebelled, [By] the sword ye are  consumed, For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How hath a faithful city become a harlot? I have filled it  [with] judgment, Righteousness lodgeth in it -- now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thy silver hath become dross, Thy drink polluted with  water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thy princes [are] apostates, and companions of thieves,  Every one loving a bribe, and pursuing rewards, The fatherless  they judge not, And the plea of the widow cometh not to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore -- the affirmation of the Lord -- Jehovah of  Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I am eased of Mine  adversaries, And I am avenged of Mine enemies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I turn back My hand upon thee, And I refine as purity  thy dross, And I turn aside all thy tin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I give back thy judges as at the first, And thy  counsellors as in the beginning, After this thou art called, `A  city of righteousness -- a faithful city.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion in judgment is redeemed, And her captivity in  righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the destruction of transgressors and sinners [is]  together, And those forsaking Jehovah are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For [men] are ashamed because of the oaks That ye have  desired, And ye are confounded because of the gardens That ye  have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For ye are as an oak whose leaf is fading, And as a garden  that hath no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong hath been for tow, And his work for a spark,  And burned have both of them together, And there is none  quenching!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
