And the arm  of Jehovah, On whom hath it been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Yea, he cometh up as a tender plant before Him, And as a  root out of a dry land, He hath no form, nor honour, when we  observe him, Nor appearance, when we desire him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He is despised, and left of men, A man of pains, and  acquainted with sickness, And as one hiding the face from us,  He is despised, and we esteemed him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Surely our sicknesses he hath borne, And our pains -- he  hath carried them, And we -- we have esteemed him plagued,  Smitten of God, and afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he is pierced for our transgressions, Bruised for our  iniquities, The chastisement of our peace [is] on him, And by  his bruise there is healing to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All of us like sheep have wandered, Each to his own way we  have turned, And Jehovah hath caused to meet on him, The  punishment of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It hath been exacted, and he hath answered, And he openeth  not his mouth, As a lamb to the slaughter he is brought, And as  a sheep before its shearers is dumb, And he openeth not his  mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By restraint and by judgment he hath been taken, And of his  generation who doth meditate, That he hath been cut off from  the land of the living? By the transgression of My people he is  plagued,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it appointeth with the wicked his grave, And with the  rich [are] his high places, Because he hath done no violence,  Nor [is] deceit in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah hath delighted to bruise him, He hath made him  sick, If his soul doth make an offering for guilt, He seeth  seed -- he prolongeth days, And the pleasure of Jehovah in his  hand doth prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Of the labour of his soul he seeth -- he is satisfied,  Through his knowledge give righteousness Doth the righteous  one, My servant, to many, And their iniquities he doth bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I give a portion to him among the many, And with  the mighty he apportioneth spoil, Because that he exposed to  death his soul, And with transgressors he was numbered, And he  the sin of many hath borne, And for transgressors he  intercedeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
