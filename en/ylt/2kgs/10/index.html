we do not make any one king -- that which [is] good  in thine eyes do.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he writeth unto them a letter a second time, saying,  `If ye [are] for me, and to my voice are hearkening, take the  heads of the men -- the sons of your lord, and come unto me  about this time to-morrow, to Jezreel;` and the sons of the  king [are] seventy men, with the great ones of the city those  bringing them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it cometh to pass, at the coming in of the letter unto  them, that they take the sons of the king, and slaughter  seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and send unto him  to Jezreel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the messenger cometh in, and declareth to him, saying,  `They have brought in the heads of the sons of the king,` and  he saith, `Make them two heaps at the opening of the gate till  the morning.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it cometh to pass in the morning, that he goeth out,  and standeth, and saith unto all the people, `Righteous are ye;  lo, I have conspired against my lord, and slay him -- and who  smote all these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Know ye now, that nothing doth fall of the word of Jehovah  to the earth that Jehovah spake against the house of Ahab, and  Jehovah hath done that which He spake by the hand of His  servant Elijah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehu smiteth all those left to the house of Ahab in  Jezreel, and all his great men, and his acquaintances, and his  priests, till he hath not left to him a remnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he riseth, and cometh in and goeth to Samaria; he [is]  at the shepherds` shearing-house in the way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and Jehu hath found the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah,  and saith, `Who [are] ye?` and they say, `Brethren of Ahaziah  we [are], and we go down to salute the sons of the king, and  the sons of the mistress.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he saith, `Catch them alive;` and they catch them  alive, and slaughter them at the pit of the shearing-house,  forty and two men, and he hath not left a man of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he goeth thence, and findeth Jehonadab son of Rechab  -- to meet him, and blesseth him, and saith unto him, `Is thy  heart right, as my heart [is] with thy heart?` and Jehonadab  saith, `It is;` -- `Then it is; give thy hand;` and he giveth  his hand, and he causeth him to come up into him into the  chariot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and saith, `Come with me, and look on my zeal for  Jehovah;` and they cause him to ride in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he cometh in to Samaria, and smiteth all those left to  Ahab in Samaria, till his destroying him, according to the word  of Jehovah that He spake unto Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehu gathereth the whole of the people, and saith unto  them, `Ahab served Baal a little -- Jehu doth serve him much:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and now, all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and  all his priests, call ye unto me; let not a man be lacking, for  a great sacrifice I have for Baal; every one who is lacking --  he doth not live;` and Jehu hath done [it] in subtilty, in  order to destroy the servants of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehu saith, `Sanctify a restraint for Baal;` and they  proclaim [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehu sendeth into all Israel, and all the servants of  Baal come in, and there hath not been left a man who hath not  come in; and they come in to the house of Baal, and the house  of Baal is full -- mouth to mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he saith to him who [is] over the wardrobe, `Bring out  clothing to all servants of Baal;` and he bringeth out to them  the clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehu goeth in, and Jehonadab son of Rechab, to the  house of Baal, and saith to the servants of Baal, `Search and  see, lest there be here with you of the servants of Jehovah --  but, the servants of Baal by themselves.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they come in to make sacrifices and burnt-offerings,  and Jehu hath set for himself in an out-place eighty men, and  saith, `The man who letteth escape [any] of the men whom I am  bringing in unto your hand -- his soul for his soul.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it cometh to pass at his finishing to make the  burnt-offering, that Jehu saith to the runners, and to the  captains, `Go in, smite them, let none come out;` and they  smite them by the mouth of the sword, and the runners and the  captains cast [them] out; and they go unto the city, to the  house of Baal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and bring out the standing-pillars of the house of Baal,  and burn them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and break down the standing-pillar of Baal, and break down  the house of Baal, and appoint it for a draught-house unto this  day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehu destroyeth Baal out of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>only -- the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, that he caused  Israel to sin, Jehu hath not turned aside from after them --  the calves of gold that [are] at Beth-El, and in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jehovah saith unto Jehu, `Because that thou hast done  well, to do that which [is] right in Mine eyes -- according to  all that [is] in My heart thou hast done to the house of Ahab  -- the sons of the fourth [generation] do sit for thee on the  throne of Israel.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jehu hath not taken heed to walk in the law of  Jehovah, God of Israel, with all his heart, he hath not turned  aside from the sins of Jeroboam, that he caused Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In those days hath Jehovah begun to cut off [some] in  Israel, and Hazael smiteth them in all the border of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>from the Jordan, at the sun-rising, the whole land of  Gilead, of the Gadite, and the Reubenite, and the Manassahite  (from Aroer, that [is] by the brook Arnon), even Gilead and  Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the rest of the matters of Jehu, and all that he did,  and all his might, are they not written on the book of the  Chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehu lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in  Samaria, and reign doth Jehoahaz his son in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the days that Jehu hath reigned over Israel [are]  twenty and eight years, in Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
