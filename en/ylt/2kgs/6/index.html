see, at the coming in of the  messenger, shut the door, and ye have held him fast at the  door, is not the sound of the feet of his lord behind him?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He is yet speaking with them, and lo, the messenger is  coming down unto him, and he saith, `Lo, this [is] the evil  from Jehovah: what -- do I wait for Jehovah any more?`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
