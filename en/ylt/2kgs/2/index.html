if thou dost  see me taken from thee, it is to thee so; and if not, it is  not.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it cometh to pass, they are going, going on and  speaking, and lo, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and  they separate between them both, and Elijah goeth up in a  whirlwind, to the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elisha is seeing, and he is crying, `My father, my  father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen;` and he hath  not seen him again;
