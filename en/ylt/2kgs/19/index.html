for come  have sons unto the birth, and power there is not to bring  forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>`It may be Jehovah thy God doth hear all the words of the  chief of the butlers with which the king of Asshur his lord  hath sent him to reproach the living God, and hath decided  concerning the words that Jehovah thy God hath heard, and thou  hast lifted up prayer for the remnant that is found.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the servants of king Hezekiah come in unto Isaiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and Isaiah saith to them, `Thus do ye say unto your lord:  Thus said Jehovah, Be not afraid because of the words that thou  hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Asshur have  reviled Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo, I am giving in him a spirit, and he hath heard a  report, and hath turned back to his land, and I have caused him  to fall by the sword in his land.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the chief of the butlers turneth back and findeth the  king of Asshur fighting against Libnah, for he hath heard that  he hath journeyed from Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he heareth concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, saying,  `Lo, he hath come out to fight with thee;` and he turneth and  sendeth messengers unto Hezekiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`Thus do ye speak unto Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let  not thy God lift thee up in whom thou art trusting, saying,  Jerusalem is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Lo, thou hast heard that which the kings of Asshur have  done to all the lands -- to devote them; and thou art  delivered!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>did the gods of the nations deliver them whom my fathers  destroyed -- Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of  Eden, who [are] in Thelassar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where [is] the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and  the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah taketh the letters out of the hand of the  messengers, and readeth them, and goeth up to the house of  Jehovah, and Hezekiah spreadeth it before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayeth before Jehovah, and saith, `O  Jehovah, God of Israel, inhabiting the cherubs, Thou [art] God  Himself -- Thyself alone -- to all the kingdoms of the earth:  Thou hast made the heavens and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Incline, O Jehovah, Thine ear, and hear; open, O Jehovah,  Thine eyes, and see; and hear Thou the words of Sennacherib  with which he hath sent him to reproach the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`Truly, O Jehovah, kings of Asshur have laid waste the  nations, and their land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and have put their gods into fire, for they [are] no gods,  but work of the hands of man, wood and stone, and destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now, O Jehovah our God, save us, we pray Thee, out of  his hand, and know do all kingdoms of the earth that Thou [art]  Jehovah God -- Thyself alone.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaiah son of Amoz sendeth unto Hezekiah, saying,  `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed  unto Me concerning Sennacherib king of Asshur I have heard:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>this [is] the word that Jehovah spake concerning him:  `Trampled on thee -- laughed at thee, Hath the virgin daughter  of Zion Behind thee shaken the head -- Hath the daughter of  Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whom hast thou reproached and reviled? And against whom  lifted up a voice? Yea, thou dost lift up on high thine eyes --  Against the Holy One of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By the hand of thy messengers Thou hast reproached the  Lord, and sayest: In the multitude of my chariots I have come  up to a high place of mountains -- The sides of Lebanon, And I  cut down the height of its cedars, The choice of its firs, And  I enter the lodging of its extremity, The forest of its Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have digged, and drunk strange waters, And I dry up with  the sole of my steps All floods of a bulwark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hast thou not heard from afar, it I made, From days of old  that I formed it? Now I have brought it in, And it becometh a  desolation, Ruinous heaps [are] fenced cities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And their inhabitants [are] feeble-handed, They were  broken down, and are dried up, They have been the herb of the  field, And the greenness of the tender grass, Grass of the  roofs, And blasted corn -- before it hath risen up!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thy sitting down, and thy going out, And thy coming  in, I have known, And thine anger towards Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because of thine anger towards Me, And thy noise -- it  came up into Mine ears, I have put My hook in thy nose, And My  bridle in thy lips, And have caused thee to turn back, In the  way in which thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this to thee [is] the sign, Food of the year [is] the  spontaneous growth, And in the second year the self-produced,  And in the third year sow ye, and reap, And plant vineyards,  and eat their fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it hath continued -- The escaped of the house of Judah  That hath been left -- to take root beneath, And hath made  fruit upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For from Jerusalem goeth out a remnant, And an escape from  mount Zion; The zeal of Jehovah [of Hosts] doth this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, thus said Jehovah, Concerning the king of  Asshur: He doth not come in unto this city, Nor doth he shoot  there an arrow, Nor doth he come before it with shield. Nor  doth he pour out against it a mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the way that he cometh in -- In it he turneth back, And  unto this city he doth not come in, The affirmation of Jehovah  --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I have covered over this city, To save it, for Mine  own sake, And for the sake of David My servant.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it cometh to pass, in that night, that a messenger of  Jehovah goeth out, and smiteth in the camp of Asshur a hundred  eighty and five thousand, and they rise early in the morning,  and lo, all of them [are] dead corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Sennacherib king of Asshur journeyeth, and goeth, and  turneth back, and dwelleth in Nineveh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and it cometh to pass, he is bowing himself in the house  of Nisroch his god, and Adramelech and Sharezar [his sons] have  smitten him with the sword, and they have escaped to the land  of Ararat, and Esar-Haddon his son reigneth in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
