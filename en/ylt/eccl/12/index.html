And those looking out at the  windows have become dim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And doors have been shut in the street. When the noise of  the grinding is low, And [one] riseth at the voice of the bird,  And all daughters of song are bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also of that which is high they are afraid, And of the low  places in the way, And the almond-tree is despised, And the  grasshopper is become a burden, And want is increased, For man  is going unto his home age-during, And the mourners have gone  round through the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>While that the silver cord is not removed, And the golden  bowl broken, And the pitcher broken by the fountain, And the  wheel broken at the well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, And the  spirit returneth to God who gave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Vanity of vanities, said the preacher, the whole [is]  vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And further, because the preacher was wise, he still taught   the people knowledge, and gave ear, and sought out -- he made  right many similes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The preacher sought to find out pleasing words,  and,  written [by] the upright, words of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Words of the wise [are] as goads, and as fences planted  [by] the masters of collections, they have been given by one  shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And further, from these, my son, be warned;  the making of  many books hath no end, and much study [is] a weariness of the  flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The end of the whole matter let us hear: -- `Fear God, and  keep His commands, for this [is] the whole of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For every work doth God bring into judgment, with every  hidden thing, whether good or bad.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
