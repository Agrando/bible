to him whose it [is] he giveth it in the day of his  guilt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`And his guilt-offering he bringeth in to Jehovah, a ram, a  perfect one, out of the flock, at thy estimation, for a  guilt-offering, unto the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the priest hath made atonement for him before Jehovah,  and it hath been forgiven him, concerning one thing of all that  he doth, by being guilty therein.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This [is] a law of the  burnt-offering (it [is] the burnt-offering, because of the  burning on the altar all the night unto the morning, and the  fire of the altar is burning on it,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that the priest hath put on his long robe of fine linen,  and his fine linen trousers he doth put on his flesh, and hath  lifted up the ashes which the fire consumeth with the  burnt-offering on the altar, and hath put them near the altar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and he hath stripped off his garments, and hath put on  other garments, and hath brought out the ashes unto the outside  of the camp, unto a clean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And the fire on the altar is burning on it, it is not  quenched, and the priest hath burned on it wood morning by  morning, and hath arranged on it the burnt-offering, and hath  made perfume on it [with] the fat of the peace-offerings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>fire is continually burning on the altar, it is not  quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And this [is] a law of the present: sons of Aaron have  brought it near before Jehovah unto the front of the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and [one] hath lifted up of it with his hand from the flour  of the present, and from its oil, and all the frankincense  which [is] on the present, and hath made perfume on the altar,  sweet fragrance -- its memorial to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And the remnant of it do Aaron and his sons eat; [with]  unleavened things it is eaten, in the holy place, in the court  of the tent of meeting they do eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is not baken [with] any thing fermented, their portion I  have given it, out of My fire-offerings; it [is] most holy,  like the sin-offering, and like the guilt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every male among the sons of Aaron doth eat it -- a statute  age-during to your generations, out of the fire-offerings of  Jehovah: all that cometh against them is holy.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>`This [is] an offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they  bring near to Jehovah in the day of his being anointed; a tenth  of the ephah of flour [for] a continual present, half of it in  the morning, and half of it in the evening;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>on a girdel with oil it is made -- fried thou dost bring it  in; baked pieces of the present thou dost bring near, a sweet  fragrance to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And the priest who is anointed in his stead, from among  his sons, doth make it, -- a statute age-during of Jehovah: it  is completely perfumed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and every present of a priest is a whole burnt-offering; it  is not eaten.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, This [is] a  law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering  is slaughtered is the sin-offering slaughtered before Jehovah;  it [is] most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`The priest who is making atonement with it doth eat it, in  the holy place it is eaten, in the court of the tent of  meeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>all that cometh against its flesh is holy, and when [any]  of its blood is sprinkled on the garment, that on which it is  sprinkled thou dost wash in the holy place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and an earthen vessel in which it is boiled is broken, and  if in a brass vessel it is boiled, then it is scoured and  rinsed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`Every male among the priests doth eat it -- it [is] most  holy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and no sin-offering, [any] of whose blood is brought in  unto the tent of meeting to make atonement in the sanctuary is  eaten; with fire it is burnt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
