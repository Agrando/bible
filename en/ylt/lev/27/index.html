according to that which the hand of him who is vowing doth  reach doth the priest value him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`And if [it is] a beast of which they bring near an  offering to Jehovah, all that [one] giveth of it to Jehovah is  holy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he doth not change it nor exchange it, a good for a bad,  or a bad for a good; and if he really change beast for beast,  -- then it hath been -- it and its exchange is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`And if [it is] any unclean beast of which they do not  bring near an offering to Jehovah, then he hath presented the  beast before the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the priest hath valued it; whether good or bad,  according to thy valuation, O priest, so it is;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and if he really redeem it, then he hath added its fifth  to thy valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And when a man sanctifieth his house, a holy thing to  Jehovah, then hath the priest valued it, whether good or bad;  as the priest doth value it so it standeth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if he who is sanctifying doth redeem his house, then  he hath added a fifth of the money of thy valuation to it, and  it hath become his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And if of the field of his possession a man sanctify to  Jehovah, then hath thy valuation been according to its seed; a  homer of barley-seed at fifty shekels of silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>if from the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field,  according to thy valuation it standeth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then hath  the priest reckoned to him the money according to the years  which are left, unto the year of the jubilee, and it hath been  abated from thy valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`And if he really redeem the field -- he who is  sanctifying it -- then he hath added a fifth of the money of  thy valuation to it, and it hath been established to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and if he do not redeem the field, or if he hath sold the  field to another man, it is not redeemed any more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the field hath been, in its going out in the jubilee,  holy to Jehovah as a field which is devoted; to the priest is  its possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And if the field of his purchase (which [is] not of the  fields of his possession) [one] sanctify to Jehovah --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then hath the priest reckoned to him the amount of thy  valuation unto the year of jubilee, and he hath given thy  valuation in that day -- a holy thing to Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>in the year of the jubilee the field returneth to him from  whom he bought it, to him whose [is] the possession of the  land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all thy valuation is by the shekel of the sanctuary:  twenty gerahs is the shekel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`Only, a firstling which is Jehovah`s firstling among  beasts -- no man doth sanctify it, whether ox or sheep; it [is]  Jehovah`s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if among the unclean beasts, then he hath ransomed  [it] at thy valuation, and he hath added its fifth to it; and  if it is not redeemed, then it hath been sold at thy valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`Only, no devoted thing which a man devoteth to Jehovah,  of all that he hath, of man, and beast, and of the field of his  possession, is sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most  holy to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`No devoted thing, which is devoted of man, is ransomed,  it is surely put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the  fruit of the tree, is Jehovah`s -- holy to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And if a man really redeem [any] of his tithe, its fifth  he addeth to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>`And all the tithe of the herd and of the flock -- all  that passeth by under the rod -- the tenth is holy to Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he enquireth not between good and bad, nor doth he change  it; and if he really change it -- then it hath been -- it and  its exchange is holy; it is not redeemed.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These [are] the commands which Jehovah hath commanded  Moses for the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
