I  [am] Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>`Say unto them, To your generations, any man who draweth  near, out of all your seed, unto the holy things which the sons  of Israel do sanctify to Jehovah, and his uncleanness on him --  even that person hath been cut off from before Me; I [am]  Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>`Any man of the seed of Aaron, and is leprous or hath an  issue -- of the holy things he doth not eat till that he is  clean; and he who is coming against any uncleanness of a  person, or a man whose seed of copulation goeth out from him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>or a man who cometh against any teeming thing which is  unclean to him, or against a man who is unclean to him, even  any of his uncleanness --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>the person who cometh against it -- hath even been unclean  till the evening, and doth not eat of the holy things, but hath  bathed his flesh with water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the sun hath gone in, and he hath been clean, and  afterwards he doth eat of the holy things, for it [is] his  food;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>a carcase or torn thing he doth not eat, for uncleanness  thereby; I [am] Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`And they have kept My charge, and bear no sin for it, that  they have died for it when they pollute it; I [am] Jehovah  sanctifying them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`And no stranger doth eat of the holy thing; a settler of  a priest and an hireling doth not eat of the holy thing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and when a priest buyeth a person, the purchase of his  money, he doth eat of it, also one born in his house; they do  eat of his bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And a priest`s daughter, when she is a strange man`s, --  she, of the heave-offering of the holy things doth not eat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and a priest`s daughter, when she is a widow, or cast out,  and hath no seed, and hath turned back unto the house of her  father, as [in] her youth, of her father`s bread she doth eat;  but no stranger doth eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And when a man doth eat of a holy thing through  ignorance, then he hath added its fifth part to it, and hath  given [it] to the priest, with the holy thing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and they do not pollute the holy things of the sons of  Israel -- that which they lift up to Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>nor have caused them to bear the iniquity of the  guilt-offering in their eating their holy things; for I [am]  Jehovah, sanctifying them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the  sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Any man of the  house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, who bringeth  near his offering, of all his vows, or of all his willing  offerings which they bring near to Jehovah for a  burnt-offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>at your pleasure a perfect one, a male of the herd, of the  sheep or of the goats;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>nothing in which [is] blemish do ye bring near, for it is  not for a pleasing thing for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`And when a man bringeth near a sacrifice of  peace-offerings to Jehovah, to complete a vow, or for a  willing-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it is perfect  for a pleasing thing: no blemish is in it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy,  or scabbed -- ye do not bring these near to Jehovah, and a  fire-offering ye do not make of them on the altar to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`As to an ox or a sheep enlarged or dwarfed -- a  willing-offering ye do make it, but for a vow it is not  pleasing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As to a bruised, or beaten, or enlarged, or cut thing --  ye do not bring [it] near to Jehovah; even in your land ye do  not do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And from the hand of a son of a stranger ye do not bring  near the bread of your God, of any of these, for their  corruption [is] in them; blemish [is] in them; they are not  pleasing for you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>`When ox or lamb or goat is born, and it hath been seven  days under its dam, then from the eighth day and henceforth, it  is pleasing for an offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but an ox or sheep -- it and its young one, ye do not  slaughter in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to  Jehovah, at your pleasure ye do sacrifice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>on that day it is eaten, ye do not leave of it till  morning; I [am] Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and ye have kept my commands, and have done them; I [am]  Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and ye do not pollute My holy name, and I have been  hallowed in the midst of the sons of Israel; I [am] Jehovah,  sanctifying you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt, to become  your God; I [am] Jehovah.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
