on the morrow of the sabbath doth the priest wave  it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And ye have prepared in the day of your waving the sheaf  a lamb, a perfect one, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering to  Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and its present two tenth deals of flour mixed with oil, a  fire-offering to Jehovah, a sweet fragrance, and its  drink-offering, wine, a fourth of the hin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And bread and roasted corn and full ears ye do not eat  until this self-same day, until your bringing in the offering  of your God -- a statute age-during to your generations, in all  your dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`And ye have numbered to you from the morrow of the  sabbath, from the day of your bringing in the sheaf of the  wave-offering: they are seven perfect sabbaths;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>unto the morrow of the seventh sabbath ye do number fifty  days, and ye have brought near a new present to Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>out of your dwellings ye bring in bread of a  wave-offering, two [loaves], of two tenth deals of flour they  are, [with] yeast they are baken, first-[fruits] to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`And ye have brought near, besides the bread, seven lambs,  perfect ones, sons of a year, and one bullock, a son of the  herd, and two rams;

it [is] a restraint, ye do no  servile work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>`These [are] appointed seasons of Jehovah, which ye  proclaim holy convocations, to bring near a fire-offering to  Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a present, a sacrifice, and  libations, a thing of a day in its day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>apart from the sabbaths of Jehovah, and apart from your  gifts, and apart from all your vows, and apart from all your  willing-offerings, which ye give to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>`Only -- in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in  your gathering the increase of the land, ye do keep the feast  of Jehovah seven days; on the first day [is] a sabbath, and on  the eighth day a sabbath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and ye have taken to yourselves on the first day the fruit  of beautiful trees, branches of palms, and boughs of thick  trees, and willows of a brook, and have rejoiced before Jehovah  your God seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>`And ye have kept it a feast to Jehovah, seven days in a  year -- a statute age-during to your generations; in the  seventh month ye keep it a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>`In booths ye dwell seven days; all who are natives in  Israel dwell in booths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>so that your generations do know that in booths I caused  the sons of Israel to dwell; in my bringing them out of the  land of Egypt; I, Jehovah, [am] your God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Moses speaketh [concerning] the appointed seasons of  Jehovah unto the sons of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
