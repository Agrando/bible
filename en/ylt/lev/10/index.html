as to your brethren, the whole house of Israel, they  bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye do not go  out, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of Jehovah [is] upon  you;` and they do according to the word of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`Wine and strong drink thou dost not drink, thou, and thy  sons with thee, in your going in unto the tent of meeting, and  ye die not -- a statute age-during to your generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>so as to make a separation between the holy and the  common, and between the unclean and the pure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which  Jehovah hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses speaketh unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar, and unto  Ithamar his sons, who are left, `Take ye the present that is  left from the fire-offerings of Jehovah, and eat it unleavened  near the altar, for it [is] most holy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and ye have eaten it in the holy place, for it [is] thy  portion, and the portion of thy sons, from the fire-offerings  of Jehovah; for so I have been commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the  heave-offering, ye do eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons,  and thy daughters with thee;
