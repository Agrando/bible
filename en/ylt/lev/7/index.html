it [is] a guilt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`Every male among the priests doth eat it; in the holy place  it is eaten -- it [is] most holy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>as [is] a sin-offering, so [is] a guilt-offering; one law  [is] for them; the priest who maketh atonement by it -- it is  his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`And the priest who is bringing near any man`s  burnt-offering, the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath  brought near, it is the priest`s, his own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and every present which is baked in an oven, and every one  done in a frying-pan, and on a girdel, [is] the priest`s who is  bringing it near; it is his;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and every present, mixed with oil or dry, is for all the  sons of Aaron -- one as another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`And this [is] a law of the sacrifice of the  peace-offerings which [one] bringeth near to Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>if for a thank-offering he bring it near, then he hath  brought near with the sacrifice of thank-offering unleavened  cakes mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with  oil, and of fried flour cakes mixed with oil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>besides the cakes, fermented bread he doth bring near  [with] his offering, besides the sacrifice of thank-offering of  his peace-offerings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he hath brought near out of it one of the whole  offering -- a heave-offering to Jehovah; to the priest who is  sprinkling the blood of the peace-offerings -- it is his;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>as to the flesh of the sacrifice of the thank-offering of  his peace-offerings, in the day of his offering it is eaten; he  doth not leave of it till morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And if the sacrifice of his offering [is] a vow or  free-will offering, in the day of his bringing near his  sacrifice it is eaten; and on the morrow also the remnant of it  is eaten;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the remnant of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third  day with fire is burnt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his  peace-offerings be really eaten on the third day, it is not  pleasing; for him who is bringing it near it is not reckoned;  it is an abominable thing, and the person who is eating of it  his iniquity doth bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`And the flesh which cometh against any unclean thing is  not eaten; with fire it is burnt; as to the flesh, every clean  one doth eat of the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the person who eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of  the peace-offerings which [are] Jehovah`s, and his uncleanness  upon him, even that person hath been cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`And when a person cometh against any thing unclean, of the  uncleanness of man, or of the uncleanness of beasts, or of any  unclean teeming creature, and hath eaten of the flesh of the  sacrifice of the peace-offerings which [are] Jehovah`s, even  that person hath been cut off from his people.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Any fat of ox and  sheep and goat ye do not eat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and the fat of a carcase, and the fat of a torn thing is  prepared for any work, but ye do certainly not eat it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for whoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which [one]  bringeth near a fire-offering to Jehovah, even the person who  eateth hath been cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And any blood ye do not eat in all your dwellings, of  fowl, or of beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>any person who eateth any blood, even that person hath been  cut off from his people.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, He who is bringing  near the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to Jehovah doth bring  in his offering to Jehovah from the sacrifice of his  peace-offerings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>his own hands do bring in the fire-offerings of Jehovah,  the fat beside the breast, it he doth bring in with the breast,  to wave it -- a wave-offering before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And the priest hath made perfume with the fat on the  altar, and the breast hath been Aaron`s and his sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the right leg ye do make a heave-offering to the priest  of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he of the sons of Aaron who is bringing near the blood of  the peace-offerings, and the fat, his is the right leg for a  portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>`For the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the  heave-offering, I have taken from the sons of Israel, from the  sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and I give them to Aaron  the priest, and to his sons, by a statute age-during, from the  sons of Israel.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This [is] the anointing of Aaron, and the anointing of his  sons out of the fire-offerings of Jehovah, in the day he hath  brought them near to act as priest to Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>which Jehovah hath commanded to give to them in the day of  His anointing them, from the sons of Israel -- a statute  age-during to their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This [is] the law for burnt-offering, for present, and for  sin-offering, and for guilt-offering, and for consecrations,  and for a sacrifice of the peace-offerings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>which Jehovah hath commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the  day of his commanding the sons of Israel to bring near their  offerings to Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
