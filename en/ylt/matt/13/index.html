this is that sown by the  way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>`And that sown on the rocky places, this is he who is  hearing the word, and immediately with joy is receiving it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he hath not root in himself, but is temporary, and  persecution or tribulation having happened because of the word,  immediately he is stumbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And that sown toward the thorns, this is he who is  hearing the word, and the anxiety of this age, and the  deceitfulness of the riches, do choke the word, and it becometh  unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`And that sown on the good ground: this is he who is  hearing the word, and is understanding, who indeed doth bear  fruit, and doth make, some indeed a hundredfold, and some  sixty, and some thirty.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another simile he set before them, saying: `The reign of  the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and, while men are sleeping, his enemy came and sowed  darnel in the midst of the wheat, and went away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and when the herb sprang up, and yielded fruit, then  appeared also the darnel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>`And the servants of the householder, having come near,  said to him, Sir, good seed didst thou not sow in thy field?  whence then hath it the darnel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he saith to them, A man, an enemy, did this; and the  servants said to him, Wilt thou, then, [that] having gone away  we may gather it up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`And he said, No, lest -- gathering up the darnel -- ye  root up with it the wheat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>suffer both to grow together till the harvest, and in the  time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first  the darnel, and bind it in bundles, to burn it, and the wheat  gather up into my storehouse.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another simile he set before them, saying: `The reign of  the heavens is like to a grain of mustard, which a man having  taken, did sow in his field,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>which less, indeed, is than all the seeds, but when it may  be grown, is greatest of the herbs, and becometh a tree, so  that the birds of the heaven do come and rest in its branches.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another simile spake he to them: `The reign of the heavens  is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three  measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things spake Jesus in similes to the multitudes,  and without a simile he was not speaking to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the  prophet, saying, `I will open in similes my mouth, I will utter  things having been hidden from the foundation of the world.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then having let away the multitudes, Jesus came to the  house, and his disciples came near to him, saying, `Explain to  us the simile of the darnel of the field.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he answering said to them, `He who is sowing the good  seed is the Son of Man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are  the sons of the reign, and the darnel are the sons of the evil  one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest  is a full end of the age, and the reapers are messengers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>`As, then, the darnel is gathered up, and is burned with  fire, so shall it be in the full end of this age,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>the Son of Man shall send forth his messengers, and they  shall gather up out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks,  and those doing the unlawlessness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire; there  shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>`Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the  reign of their Father. He who is having ears to hear -- let him  hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>`Again, the reign of the heavens is like to treasure hid  in the field, which a man having found did hide, and from his  joy goeth, and all, as much as he hath, he selleth, and buyeth  that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>`Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a man, a  merchant, seeking goodly pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who having found one pearl of great price, having gone  away, hath sold all, as much as he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>`Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a net that was  cast into the sea, and did gather together of every kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was filled, having drawn up again upon the  beach, and having sat down, they gathered the good into  vessels, and the bad they did cast out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>so shall it be in the full end of the age, the messengers  shall come forth and separate the evil out of the midst of the  righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire, there  shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus saith to them, `Did ye understand all these?` They  say to him, `Yes, sir.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said to them, `Because of this every scribe having  been discipled in regard to the reign of the heavens, is like  to a man, a householder, who doth bring forth out of his  treasure things new and old.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these similes, he  removed thence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and having come to his own country, he was teaching them  in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and were  saying, `Whence to this one this wisdom and the mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>is not this the carpenter`s son? is not his mother called  Mary, and his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and his sisters -- are they not all with us? whence, then,  to this one all these?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and they were stumbled at him. And Jesus said to them, `A  prophet is not without honor except in his own country, and in  his own house:`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and he did not there many mighty works, because of their  unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
