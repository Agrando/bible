and he was  speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`Then said the king to the ministrants, Having bound his  feet and hands, take him up and cast forth to the outer  darkness, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the  teeth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for many are called, and few chosen.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees having gone, took counsel how they  might ensnare him in words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and they send to him their disciples with the Herodians,  saying, `Teacher, we have known that thou art true, and the way  of God in truth thou dost teach, and thou art not caring for  any one, for thou dost not look to the face of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>tell us, therefore, what dost thou think? is it lawful to  give tribute to Caesar or not?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus having known their wickedness, said, `Why me do  ye tempt, hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>show me the tribute-coin?` and they brought to him a  denary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he saith to them, `Whose [is] this image and the  inscription?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>they say to him, `Caesar`s;` then saith he to them,  `Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the  things of God to God;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and having heard they wondered, and having left him they  went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day there came near to him Sadducees, who are  saying there is not a rising again, and they questioned him,  saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`Teacher, Moses said, If any one may die not having  children, his brother shall marry his wife, and shall raise up  seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`And there were with us seven brothers, and the first  having married did die, and not having seed, he left his wife  to his brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in like manner also the second, and the third, unto the  seventh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and last of all died also the woman;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>therefore in the rising again, of which of the seven shall  she be wife -- for all had her?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answering said to them, `Ye go astray, not  knowing the Writings, nor the power of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for in the rising again they do not marry, nor are they  given in marriage, but are as messengers of God in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And concerning the rising again of the dead, did ye not  read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God  of Jacob? God is not a God of dead men, but of living.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And having heard, the multitudes were astonished at his  teaching;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and the Pharisees, having heard that he did silence the  Sadducees, were gathered together unto him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and one of them, a lawyer, did question, tempting him, and  saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>`Teacher, which [is] the great command in the Law?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus said to him, `Thou shalt love the Lord thy God  with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine  understanding --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>this is a first and great command;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the second [is] like to it, Thou shalt love thy  neighbor as thyself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>on these -- the two commands -- all the law and the  prophets do hang.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus did  question them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, `What do ye think concerning the Christ? of whom  is he son?` They say to him, `Of David.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He saith to them, `How then doth David in the Spirit call  him lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The Lord said to my lord, Sit at my right hand, till I may  make thine enemies thy footstool?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If then David doth call him lord, how is he his son?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no one was able to answer him a word, nor durst any  from that day question him any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
