to say, The sins have been forgiven to  thee; or to say, Rise, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`But, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power upon  the earth to forgive sins -- (then saith he to the paralytic)  -- having risen, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he, having risen, went to his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the multitudes having seen, wondered, and glorified God,  who did give such power to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jesus passing by thence, saw a man sitting at the  tax-office, named Matthew, and saith to him, `Be following me,`  and he, having risen, did follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, he reclining (at meat) in the house,  that lo, many tax-gatherers and sinners having come, were lying  (at meat) with Jesus and his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the Pharisees having seen, said to his disciples,  `Wherefore with the tax-gatherers and sinners doth your teacher  eat?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus having heard, said to them, `They who are whole  have no need of a physician, but they who are ill;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but having gone, learn ye what is, Kindness I will, and not  sacrifice, for I did not come to call righteous men, but  sinners, to reformation.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then come to him do the disciples of John, saying,  `Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples  fast not?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus said to them, `Can the sons of the bride-chamber  mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? but days shall  come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they  shall fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And no one doth put a patch of undressed cloth on an old  garment, for its filling up doth take from the garment, and a  worse rent is made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`Nor do they put new wine into old skins, and if not -- the  skins burst, and the wine doth run out, and the skins are  destroyed, but they put new wine into new skins, and both are  preserved together.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he is speaking these things to them, lo, a ruler  having come, was bowing to him, saying that `My daughter just  now died, but, having come, lay thy hand upon her, and she  shall live.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus having risen, did follow him, also his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and lo, a woman having an issue of blood twelve years,  having come to him behind, did touch the fringe of his  garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for she said within herself, `If only I may touch his  garment, I shall be saved.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus having turned about, and having seen her, said,  `Be of good courage, daughter, thy faith hath saved thee,` and  the woman was saved from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus having come to the house of the ruler, and having  seen the minstrels and the multitude making tumult,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>he saith to them, `Withdraw, for the damsel did not die,  but doth sleep,` and they were deriding him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but, when the multitude was put forth, having gone in, he  took hold of her hand, and the damsel arose,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the fame of this went forth to all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus passing on thence, two blind men followed him,  calling and saying, `Deal kindly with us, Son of David.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he having come to the house, the blind men came to him,  and Jesus saith to them, `Believe ye that I am able to do  this?` They say to him, `Yes, sir.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then touched he their eyes, saying, `According to your  faith let it be to you,`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged  them, saying, `See, let no one know;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but they, having gone forth, did spread his fame in all  that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as they are coming forth, lo, they brought to him a man  dumb, a demoniac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the demon having been cast out, the dumb spake, and the  multitude did wonder, saying that `It was never so seen in  Israel:`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but the Pharisees said, `By the ruler of the demons he doth  cast out the demons.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the  villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the  good news of the reign, and healing every sickness and every  malady among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having seen the multitudes, he was moved with  compassion for them, that they were faint and cast aside, as  sheep not having a shepherd,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>then saith he to his disciples, `The harvest indeed [is]  abundant, but the workmen few;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>beseech ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he may  put forth workmen to His harvest.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
