Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`For, if ye may forgive men their trespasses He also will  forgive you -- your Father who [is] in the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if ye may not forgive men their trespasses, neither  will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And when ye may fast, be ye not as the hypocrites, of sour  countenances, for they disfigure their faces, that they may  appear to men fasting; verily I say to you, that they have  their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`But thou, fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that thou mayest not appear to men fasting, but to thy  Father who [is] in secret, and thy Father, who is seeing in  secret, shall reward thee manifestly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`Treasure not up to yourselves treasures on the earth,  where moth and rust disfigure, and where thieves break through  and steal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but treasure up to yourselves treasures in heaven, where  neither moth nor rust doth disfigure, and where thieves do not  break through nor steal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for where your treasure is, there will be also your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`The lamp of the body is the eye, if, therefore, thine eye  may be perfect, all thy body shall be enlightened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but if thine eye may be evil, all thy body shall be dark;  if, therefore, the light that [is] in thee is darkness -- the  darkness, how great!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`None is able to serve two lords, for either he will hate  the one and love the other, or he will hold to the one, and  despise the other; ye are not able to serve God and Mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`Because of this I say to you, be not anxious for your  life, what ye may eat, and what ye may drink, nor for your  body, what ye may put on. Is not the life more than the  nourishment, and the body than the clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>look to the fowls of the heaven, for they do not sow, nor  reap, nor gather into storehouses, and your heavenly Father  doth nourish them; are not ye much better than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>`And who of you, being anxious, is able to add to his age  one cubit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and about clothing why are ye anxious? consider well the  lilies of the field; how do they grow? they do not labour, nor  do they spin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory  was arrayed as one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`And if the herb of the field, that to-day is, and  to-morrow is cast to the furnace, God doth so clothe -- not  much more you, O ye of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>therefore ye may not be anxious, saying, What may we eat?  or, What may we drink? or, What may we put round?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for all these do the nations seek for, for your  heavenly Father doth know that ye have need of all these;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but seek ye first the reign of God and His righteousness,  and all these shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Be not therefore anxious for the morrow, for the morrow  shall be anxious for its own things; sufficient for the day  [is] the evil of it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
