thou art a stumbling-block to me, for thou dost not  mind the things of God, but the things of men.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Jesus to his disciples, `If any one doth will to  come after me, let him disown himself, and take up his cross,  and follow me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for whoever may will to save his life, shall lose it, and  whoever may lose his life for my sake shall find it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for what is a man profited if he may gain the whole world,  but of his life suffer loss? or what shall a man give as an  exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>`For, the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his  Father, with his messengers, and then he will reward each,  according to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Verily I say to you, there are certain of those standing  here who shall not taste of death till they may see the Son of  Man coming in his reign.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
