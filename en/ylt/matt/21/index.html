and who  gave thee this authority?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answering said to them, `I will ask you -- I  also -- one word, which if ye may tell me, I also will tell you  by what authority I do these things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the baptism of John, whence was it? -- from heaven, or  from men?` And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, `If  we should say, From heaven; he will say to us, Wherefore, then,  did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and if we should say, From men, we fear the multitude, for  all hold John as a prophet.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And answering Jesus they said, `We have not known.` He  said to them -- he also -- `Neither do I tell you by what  authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`And what think ye? A man had two children, and having  come to the first, he said, Child, go, to-day be working in my  vineyard.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he answering said, `I will not,` but at last, having  repented, he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`And having come to the second, he said in the same  manner, and he answering said, I [go], sir, and went not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which of the two did the will of the father?` They say to  him, `The first.` Jesus saith to them, `Verily I say to you,  that the tax-gatherers and the harlots do go before you into  the reign of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye  did not believe him, and the tax-gatherers and the harlots did  believe him, and ye, having seen, repented not at last -- to  believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>`Hear ye another simile: There was a certain man, a  householder, who planted a vineyard, and did put a hedge round  it, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and gave  it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>`And when the season of the fruits came nigh, he sent his  servants unto the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and the husbandmen having taken his servants, one they  scourged, and one they killed, and one they stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>`Again he sent other servants more than the first, and  they did to them in the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>`And at last he sent unto them his son, saying, They will  reverence my son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the husbandmen having seen the son, said among  themselves, This is the heir, come, we may kill him, and may  possess his inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and having taken him, they cast [him] out of the vineyard,  and killed him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>whenever therefore the lord of the vineyard may come, what  will he do to these husbandmen?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say to him, `Evil men -- he will evilly destroy them,  and the vineyard will give out to other husbandmen, who will  give back to him the fruits in their seasons.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus saith to them, `Did ye never read in the Writings, A  stone that the builders disallowed, it became head of a corner;  from the Lord hath this come to pass, and it is wonderful in  our eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>`Because of this I say to you, that the reign of God shall  be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth its  fruit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and he who is falling on this stone shall be broken, and  on whomsoever it may fall it will crush him to pieces.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the chief priests and the Pharisees having heard his  similes, knew that of them he speaketh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes,  seeing they were holding him as a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
