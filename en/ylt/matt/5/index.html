shall be in  danger of the sanhedrim, and whoever may say, Rebel! shall be  in danger of the gehenna of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`If, therefore, thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar,  and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything  against thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave there thy gift before the altar, and go -- first be  reconciled to thy brother, and then having come bring thy gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`Be agreeing with thy opponent quickly, while thou art in  the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver thee to the  judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and to  prison thou mayest be cast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>verily I say to thee, thou mayest not come forth thence  till that thou mayest pay the last farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>`Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not  commit adultery;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but I -- I say to you, that every one who is looking on a  woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in  his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`But, if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it  out and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy  members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`And, if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble, cut it  off, and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy  members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let  him give to her a writing of divorce;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I -- I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife,  save for the matter of whoredom, doth make her to commit  adultery; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth  commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>`Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou  shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine  oaths;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but I -- I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the  heaven, because it is the throne of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by  Jerusalem, because it is a city of a great king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>nor by thy head mayest thou swear, because thou art not  able one hair to make white or black;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but let your word be, Yes, Yes, No, No, and that which is  more than these is of the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>`Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for  tooth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but I -- I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever  shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and whoever is willing to take thee to law, and thy coat to  take -- suffer to him also the cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>`And whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>to him who is asking of thee be giving, and him who is  willing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>`Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor,  and shalt hate thine enemy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but I -- I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those  cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those  accusing you falsely, and persecuting you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because  His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good, and He doth  send rain on righteous and unrighteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>`For, if ye may love those loving you, what reward have ye?  do not also the tax-gatherers the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and if ye may salute your brethren only, what do ye  abundant? do not also the tax-gatherers so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>ye shall therefore be perfect, as your Father who [is] in  the heavens is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
