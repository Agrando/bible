till when shall I bear  you? bring him to me hither;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out of him, and  the lad was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples having come to Jesus by himself, said,  `Wherefore were we not able to cast him out?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to them, `Through your want of faith; for  verily I say to you, if ye may have faith as a grain of  mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Remove hence to yonder  place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to  you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and this kind doth not go forth except in prayer and  fasting.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they are living in Galilee, Jesus said to them,  `The Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of  men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise,`  and they were exceeding sorry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they having come to Capernaum, those receiving the  didrachms came near to Peter, and said, `Your teacher -- doth  he not pay the didrachms?` He saith, `Yes.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him,  saying, `What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth --  from whom do they receive custom or poll-tax? from their sons  or from the strangers?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter saith to him, `From the strangers.` Jesus said to  him, `Then are the sons free;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but, that we may not cause them to stumble, having gone to  the sea, cast a hook, and the fish that hath come up first take  thou up, and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater,  that having taken, give to them for me and thee.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
