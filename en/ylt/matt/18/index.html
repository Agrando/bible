if a man may have an hundred sheep, and  there may go astray one of them, doth he not -- having left the  ninety-nine, having gone on the mountains -- seek that which is  gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and if it may come to pass that he doth find it, verily I  say to you, that he doth rejoice over it more than over the  ninety-nine that have not gone astray;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>so it is not will in presence of your Father who is in the  heavens, that one of these little ones may perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`And if thy brother may sin against thee, go and show him  his fault between thee and him alone, if he may hear thee, thou  didst gain thy brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and if he may not hear, take with thee yet one or two,  that by the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may  stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`And if he may not hear them, say [it] to the assembly,  and if also the assembly he may not hear, let him be to thee as  the heathen man and the tax-gatherer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`Verily I say to you, Whatever things ye may bind upon the  earth shall be having been bound in the heavens, and whatever  things ye may loose on the earth shall be having been loosed in  the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`Again, I say to you, that, if two of you may agree on the  earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask -- it shall be  done to them from my Father who is in the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for where there are two or three gathered together -- to  my name, there am I in the midst of them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter having come near to him, said, `Sir, how often  shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him -- till  seven times?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus saith to him, `I do not say to thee till seven  times, but till seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`Because of this was the reign of the heavens likened to a  man, a king, who did will to take reckoning with his servants,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he having begun to take account, there was brought  near to him one debtor of a myriad of talents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he having nothing to pay, his lord did command him to  be sold, and his wife, and the children, and all, whatever he  had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The servant then, having fallen down, was bowing to him,  saying, Sir, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the lord of that servant having been moved with  compassion did release him, and the debt he forgave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`And, that servant having come forth, found one of his  fellow-servants who was owing him an hundred denaries, and  having laid hold, he took him by the throat, saying, Pay me  that which thou owest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His fellow-servant then, having fallen down at his feet,  was calling on him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will  pay thee all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and he would not, but having gone away, he cast him into  prison, till he might pay that which was owing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And his fellow-servants having seen the things that were  done, were grieved exceedingly, and having come, shewed fully  to their lord all the things that were done;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>then having called him, his lord saith to him, Evil  servant! all that debt I did forgive thee, seeing thou didst  call upon me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>did it not behove also thee to have dealt kindly with thy  fellow-servant, as I also dealt kindly with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>`And having been wroth, his lord delivered him to the  inquisitors, till he might pay all that was owing to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so also my heavenly Father will do to you, if ye may not  forgive each one his brother from your hearts their  trespasses.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
