I find thee without, I kiss thee, Yea, they do  not despise me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I lead thee, I bring thee in unto my mother`s house, She  doth teach me, I cause thee to drink of the perfumed wine, Of  the juice of my pomegranate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His left hand [is] under my head, And his right doth embrace  me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, How ye stir up,  And how ye wake the love till she please!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who [is] this coming from the wilderness, Hasting herself  for her beloved? Under the citron-tree I have waked thee, There  did thy mother pledge thee, There she gave a pledge [that] bare  thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set me as a seal on thy heart, as a seal on thine arm, For  strong as death is love, Sharp as Sheol is jealousy, Its  burnings [are] burnings of fire, a flame of Jah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Many waters are not able to quench the love, And floods do  not wash it away. If one give all the wealth of his house for  love, Treading down -- they tread upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We have a little sister, and breasts she hath not, What do  we do for our sister, In the day that it is told of her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If she is a wall, we build by her a palace of silver. And if  she is a door, We fashion by her board-work of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I [am] a wall, and my breasts as towers, Then I have been  in his eyes as one finding peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Solomon hath a vineyard in Baal-Hamon, He hath given the  vineyard to keepers, Each bringeth for its fruit a thousand  silverlings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My vineyard -- my own -- is before me, The thousand [is]  for thee, O Solomon. And the two hundred for those keeping its  fruit. O dweller in gardens!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The companions are attending to thy voice, Cause me to  hear. Flee, my beloved, and be like to a roe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Or to a young one of the harts on mountains of spices!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
