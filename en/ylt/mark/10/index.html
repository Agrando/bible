no one  [is] good except One -- God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit  adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal,  Thou mayest not bear false witness, Thou mayest not defraud,  Honour thy father and mother.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he answering said to him, `Teacher, all these did I  keep from my youth.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus having looked upon him, did love him, and said  to him, `One thing thou dost lack; go away, whatever thou hast  -- sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in  heaven, and come, be following me, having taken up the cross.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he -- gloomy at the word -- went away sorrowing, for  he was having many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus having looked round, saith to his disciples,  `How hardly shall they who have riches enter into the reign of  God!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the disciples were astonished at his words, and Jesus  again answering saith to them, `Children, how hard is it to  those trusting on the riches to enter into the reign of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel through the eye of the needle to  enter, than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying unto  themselves, `And who is able to be saved?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus, having looked upon them, saith, `With men it is  impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with  God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter began to say to him, `Lo, we left all, and we  followed thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answering said, `Verily I say to you, there is  no one who left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or  mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for my sake, and for  the good news`,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who may not receive an hundredfold now in this time,  houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children,  and fields, with persecutions, and in the age that is coming,  life age-during;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and many first shall be last, and the last first.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus  was going before them, and they were amazed, and following  they were afraid. And having again taken the twelve, he began  to tell them the things about to happen to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>-- `Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be  delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes, and they  shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the  nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they shall mock him, and scourge him, and spit on him,  and kill him, and the third day he shall rise again.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And there come near to him James and John, the sons of  Zebedee, saying, `Teacher, we wish that whatever we may ask  for ourselves, thou mayest do for us;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he said to them, `What do ye wish me to do for you?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they said to him, `Grant to us that, one on thy right  hand and one on thy left, we may sit in thy glory;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and Jesus said to them, `Ye have not known what ye ask;  are ye able to drink of the cup that I drink of, and with the  baptism that I am baptized with -- to be baptized?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said to him, `We are able;` and Jesus said to  them, `Of the cup indeed that I drink of, ye shall drink, and  with the baptism that I am baptized with, ye shall be  baptized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but to sit on my right and on my left, is not mine to  give, but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the ten having heard, began to be much displeased at  James and John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but Jesus having called them near, saith to them, `Ye have  known that they who are considered to rule the nations do  exercise lordship over them, and their great ones do exercise  authority upon them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but not so shall it be among you; but whoever may will to  become great among you, he shall be your minister,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever of you may will to become first, he shall be  servant of all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>for even the Son of Man came not to be ministered to, but  to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they come to Jericho, and as he is going forth from  Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, a son of  Timaeus -- Bartimaeus the blind -- was sitting beside the way  begging,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarene, he began  to cry out, and to say, `The Son of David -- Jesus! deal kindly  with me;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and many were rebuking him, that he might keep silent, but  the more abundantly he cried out, `Son of David, deal kindly  with me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jesus having stood, he commanded him to be called, and  they call the blind man, saying to him, `Take courage, rise, he  doth call thee;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and he, having cast away his garment, having risen, did  come unto Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And answering, Jesus saith to him, `What wilt thou I may  do to thee?` and the blind man said to him, `Rabboni, that I  may see again;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and Jesus said to him, `Go, thy faith hath saved thee:`  and immediately he saw again, and was following Jesus in the  way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
