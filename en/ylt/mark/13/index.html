beginnings of sorrows  [are] these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`And take ye heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you  up to sanhedrims, and to synagogues, ye shall be beaten, and  before governors and kings ye shall be set for my sake, for a  testimony to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and to all the nations it behoveth first that the good  news be proclaimed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`And when they may lead you, delivering up, be not anxious  beforehand what ye may speak, nor premeditate, but whatever  may be given to you in that hour, that speak ye, for it is not  ye who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father  child, and children shall rise up against parents, and shall  put them to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and ye shall be hated by all because of my name, but he  who hath endured to the end -- he shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And when ye may see the abomination of the desolation,  that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it  ought not, (whoever is reading let him understand), then those  in Judea, let them flee to the mountains;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he upon the house-top, let him not come down to the  house, nor come in to take anything out of his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he who is in the field, let him not turn to the things  behind, to take up his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`And wo to those with child, and to those giving suck, in  those days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for those days shall be tribulation, such as hath not been  from the beginning of the creation that God created, till now,  and may not be;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and if the Lord did not shorten the days, no flesh had  been saved; but because of the chosen, whom He did choose to  Himself, He did shorten the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`And then, if any may say to you, Lo, here [is] the  Christ, or, Lo, there, ye may not believe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for there shall rise false Christs and false prophets, and  they shall give signs and wonders, to seduce, if possible,  also the chosen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and ye, take heed; lo, I have foretold you all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall  be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the stars of the heaven shall be falling, and the  powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds  with much power and glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and then he shall send his messengers, and gather together  his chosen from the four winds, from the end of the earth unto  the end of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`And from the fig-tree learn ye the simile: when the  branch may already become tender, and may put forth the  leaves, ye know that nigh is the summer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so ye, also, when these ye may see coming to pass, ye know  that it is nigh, at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Verily I say to you, that this generation may not pass  away till all these things may come to pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words  shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>`And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known --  not even the messengers who are in the heaven, not even the  Son -- except the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take heed, watch and pray, for ye have not known when the  time is;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>as a man who is gone abroad, having left his house, and  given to his servants the authority, and to each one his work,  did command also the porter that he may watch;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>watch ye, therefore, for ye have not known when the lord  of the house doth come, at even, or at midnight, or at  cock-crowing, or at the morning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest, having come suddenly, he may find you sleeping;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
