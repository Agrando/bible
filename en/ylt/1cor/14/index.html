I will pray with the spirit, and I will  pray also with the understanding; I will sing psalms with the  spirit, and I will sing psalms also with the understanding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>since, if thou mayest bless with the spirit, he who is  filling the place of the unlearned, how shall he say the Amen  at thy giving of thanks, since what thou dost say he hath not  known?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for thou, indeed, dost give thanks well, but the other is  not built up!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I give thanks to my God -- more than you all with tongues  speaking --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but in an assembly I wish to speak five words through my  understanding, that others also I may instruct, rather than  myriads of words in an [unknown] tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, become not children in the understanding, but in  the evil be ye babes, and in the understanding become ye  perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>in the law it hath been written, that, `With other tongues  and with other lips I will speak to this people, and not even  so will they hear Me, saith the Lord;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>so that the tongues are for a sign, not to the believing,  but to the unbelieving; and the prophesy [is] not for the  unbelieving, but for the believing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If, therefore, the whole assembly may come together, to  the same place, and all may speak with tongues, and there may  come in unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are  mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and if all may prophecy, and any one may come in, an  unbeliever or unlearned, he is convicted by all, he is  discerned by all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and so the secrets of his heart become manifest, and so  having fallen upon [his] face, he will bow before God,  declaring that God really is among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What then is it, brethren? whenever ye may come together,  each of you hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a tongue, hath  a revelation, hath an interpretation? let all things be for  building up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>if an [unknown] tongue any one do speak, by two, or at the  most, by three, and in turn, and let one interpret;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and if there may be no interpreter, let him be silent in  an assembly, and to himself let him speak, and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And prophets -- let two or three speak, and let the others  discern,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and if to another sitting [anything] may be revealed, let  the first be silent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for ye are able, one by one, all to prophesy, that all may  learn, and all may be exhorted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the spiritual gift of prophets to prophets are  subject,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for God is not [a God] of tumult, but of peace, as in all  the assemblies of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Your women in the assemblies let them be silent, for it  hath not been permitted to them to speak, but to be subject, as  also the law saith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and if they wish to learn anything, at home their own  husbands let them question, for it is a shame to women to speak  in an assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>From you did the word of God come forth? or to you alone  did it come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>if any one doth think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let  him acknowledge the things that I write to you -- that of the  Lord they are commands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and if any one is ignorant -- let him be ignorant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>so that, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and to  speak with tongues do not forbid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
