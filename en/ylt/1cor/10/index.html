the bread that we break  -- is it not the fellowship of the body of the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because one bread, one body, are we the many -- for we all  of the one bread do partake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>See Israel according to the flesh! are not those eating  the sacrifices in the fellowship of the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>what then do I say? that an idol is anything? or that a  sacrifice offered to an idol is anything? --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[no,] but that the things that the nations sacrifice --  they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not wish you  to come into the fellowship of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye are not able the cup of the Lord to drink, and the cup  of demons; ye are not able of the table of the Lord to partake,  and of the table of demons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>do we arouse the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than  He?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things to me are lawful, but all things are not  profitable; all things to me are lawful, but all things do not  build up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>let no one seek his own -- but each another`s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whatever in the meat-market is sold eat ye, not inquiring,  because of the conscience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the Lord`s [is] the earth, and its fulness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and if any one of the unbelieving do call you, and ye wish  to go, all that is set before you eat, nothing inquiring,  because of the conscience;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and if any one may say to you, `This is a thing sacrificed  to an idol,` -- do not eat, because of that one who shewed  [it], and of the conscience, for the Lord`s [is] the earth and  its fulness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and conscience, I say, not of thyself, but of the other,  for why [is it] that my liberty is judged by another`s  conscience?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and if I thankfully do partake, why am I evil spoken of,  for that for which I give thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether, then, ye eat, or drink, or do anything, do all to  the glory of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>become offenceless, both to Jews and Greeks, and to the  assembly of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>as I also in all things do please all, not seeking my own  profit, but that of many -- that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
