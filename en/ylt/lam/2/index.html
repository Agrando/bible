What do I equal to thee, and I comfort  thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For great as a sea [is] thy  breach, Who doth give healing to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thy prophets have seen for thee a false and insipid thing,  And have not revealed concerning thine iniquity, To turn back  thy captivity, And they see for thee false burdens and causes  of expulsion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Clapped hands at thee have all passing by the way, They  have hissed -- and they shake the head At the daughter of  Jerusalem: `Is this the city of which they said: The perfection  of beauty, a joy to all the land?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Opened against thee their mouth have all thine enemies,  They have hissed, yea, they gnash the teeth, They have said:  `We have swallowed [her] up, Surely this [is] the day that we  looked for, We have found -- we have seen.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah hath done that which He devised, He hath fulfilled  His saying That He commanded from the days of old, He hath  broken down and hath not pitied, And causeth an enemy to  rejoice over thee, He lifted up the horn of thine adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Cried hath their heart unto the Lord; O wall of the  daughter of Zion, Cause to go down as a stream tears daily and  nightly, Give not rest to thyself, Let not the daughter of  thine eye stand still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Arise, cry aloud in the night, At the beginning of the  watches. Pour out as water thy heart, Over against the face of  the Lord, Lift up unto Him thy hands, for the soul of thine  infants, Who are feeble with hunger at the head of all  out-places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>See, O Jehovah, and look attentively, To whom Thou hast  acted thus, Do women eat their fruit, infants of a handbreadth?  Slain in the sanctuary of the Lord are priest and prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Lain on the earth [in] out-places have young and old, My  virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword, Thou hast  slain in a day of Thine anger, Thou hast slaughtered -- Thou  hast not pitied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou dost call as [at] a day of appointment, My fears from  round about, And there hath not been in the day of the anger of  Jehovah, An escaped and remaining one, They whom I stretched  out and nourished, My enemy hath consumed!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
