Thy father -- did he not eat and drink? Yea, he did  judgment and righteousness, Then [it is] well with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He decided the cause of the poor and needy, Then [it is]  well -- is it not to know Me? An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thine eyes and thy heart are not, Except on thy  dishonest gain, And on shedding of innocent blood, And on  oppression, and on doing of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore, thus said Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim son of  Josiah king of Judah: They do not lament for him, Ah, my  brother, and Ah, sister, They do not lament for him, Ah, lord,  and Ah, his honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The burial of an ass -- he is buried, Dragged and cast out  thence to the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Lebanon, and cry, And in Bashan give forth thy  voice, And cry from Abarim, For destroyed have been all loving  thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have spoken unto thee in thine ease, Thou hast said, `I  do not hearken,` This [is] thy way from thy youth, For thou  hast not hearkened to My voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All thy friends consume doth wind, And thy lovers into  captivity do go, Surely then thou art ashamed, And hast blushed  for all thy wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O dweller in Lebanon, making a nest among cedars, How  gracious hast thou been when pangs come to thee, Pain -- as of  a travailing woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I live -- an affirmation of Jehovah, Though Coniah son of  Jehoiakim king of Judah Were a seal on My right hand, Surely  thence I draw thee away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I have given thee into the hand of those seeking thy  life, And into hands of which thou art afraid, Into the hand of  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, And into the hand of the  Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I have cast thee, And thy mother who bore thee, unto  another country, Where ye were not born, and there do ye die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And to the land whither they are lifting up their soul to  return, Thither they do not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A grief -- a despised broken thing -- is this man Coniah?  A vessel in which there is no pleasure? Wherefore have they  been cast up and down, He and his seed, Yea, they were cast on  to a land that they knew not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Earth, earth, earth, hear a word of Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus said Jehovah: Write ye this man childless, A man --  he doth not prosper in his days, For none of his seed doth  prosper, Sitting on the throne of David, And ruling again in  Judah!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
