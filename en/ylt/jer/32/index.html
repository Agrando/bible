there  is nothing too wonderful for Thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Doing kindness to thousands, and recompensing iniquity of  fathers into the bosom of their sons after them; God, the  great, the mighty, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Great in counsel, and mighty in act, in that Thine eyes  are open on all the ways of the sons of Adam, to give to each  according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his  doings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that thou hast done signs and wonders in the land of  Egypt unto this day, and in Israel, and among men, and Thou  dost make for Thee a name as [at] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`And Thou bringest forth Thy people Israel from the land  of Egypt, with signs and with wonders, and by a strong hand,  and by a stretched-out arm, and by great fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou givest to them this land that thou didst swear to  their fathers to give to them, a land flowing with milk and  honey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they come in, and possess it, and they have not  hearkened to Thy voice, and in Thy law have not walked, all  that which Thou didst lay a charge on them to do they have not  done, and Thou dost proclaim [to] them all this evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`Lo, the mounts -- they have come in to the city to  capture it, and the city hath been given into the hand of the  Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword,  and the famine, and the pestilence; and that which Thou hast  spoken hath come to pass, and lo, Thou art seeing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet Thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy for thee  the field with money, and cause witnesses to testify -- and the  city hath been given into the hand of the Chaldeans!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the word of Jehovah is unto Jeremiah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>`Lo, I [am] Jehovah, God of all flesh: For Me is anything  too wonderful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`Therefore, thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am giving this city  into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he hath captured it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And come in have the Chaldeans who are fighting against  this city, and they have set this city on fire, and have burned  it, and the houses on whose roofs they made perfume to Baal,  and poured out libations to other gods, so as to provoke Me to  anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been  only doing evil in Mine eyes, from their youth; for the sons of  Israel are only provoking Me with the work of their hands -- an  affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`For a cause of Mine anger, and a cause of My fury, hath  this city been to Me, even from the day that they built it, and  unto this day -- to turn it aside from before My face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Because of all the evil of the sons of Israel, and of the  sons of Judah that they have done, so as to provoke Me -- they,  their kings, their heads, their priests, and their prophets,  and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they turn unto Me the neck, and not the face, and  teaching them, rising early and teaching, and they are not  hearkening to accept instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>`And they set their abominations in the house over which  My name is called, so as to defile it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they build the high places of Baal, that [are] in the  valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their  daughters to pass through to Molech, which I did not command  them, nor did it come up on my heart to do this abomination, so  as to cause Judah to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>`And now, therefore, thus said Jehovah, God of Israel,  concerning this city, of which ye are saying, It hath been  given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, and by  famine, and by pestilence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Lo, I am gathering them out of all the lands whither I  have driven them in Mine anger, and in My fury, and in great  wrath, and I have brought them back unto this place, and have  caused them to dwell confidently;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and they have been to Me for a people, and I am to them  for God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and I have given to them one heart, and one way, to fear  Me all the days, for good to them, and to their sons after  them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and I have made for them a covenant age-during, in that I  turn not back from after them for My doing them good, and My  fear I put in their heart, so as not to turn aside from me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and I have rejoiced over them to do them good, and have  planted them in this land in truth, with all my heart, and with  all My soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>`For thus said Jehovah: As I brought in unto this people  all this great evil, so I am bringing in on them all the good  that I am speaking concerning them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and bought hath been the field in this land of which ye  are saying, A desolation it [is], without man and beast, it  hath been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Fields with money they buy, so as to write in a book, and  to seal, and to cause witnesses to testify, in the land of  Benjamin, and in suburbs of Jerusalem, and in cities of Judah,  and in cities of the hill-country, and in cities of the low  country, and in cities of the south, for I turn back their  captivity -- an affirmation of Jehovah.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
