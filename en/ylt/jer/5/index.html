Thou hast  smitten them, and they have not grieved, Thou hast consumed  them, They have refused to receive instruction, They made their  faces harder than a rock, They have refused to turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I -- I said, `Surely these [are] poor, They have been  foolish, For they have not known the way of Jehovah, The  judgment of their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I get me to the great, and I speak with them, For they have  known the way of Jehovah, The judgment of their God.` Surely  they together have broken the yoke, They have drawn away the  bands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore smitten them hath a lion out of the forest, A wolf  of the deserts doth spoil them, A leopard is watching over  their cities, Every one who is going out of them is torn, For  many have been their transgressions, Mighty have been their  backslidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For this I am not propitious to thee, Thy sons have forsaken  Me, And are satisfied by that which is not god, I satisfy them,  and they commit adultery, And at the house of a harlot They  gather themselves together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Fed horses -- they have been early risers, Each to the wife  of his neighbour they neigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For these do I not lay a charge? An affirmation of Jehovah,  And on a nation such as this, Doth not My soul avenge itself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go ye up on her walls, and destroy, And a completion make  not, Turn aside her branches, for they [are] not Jehovah`s,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For dealt treacherously against Me have the house of  Israel, And the house of Judah, an affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have lied against Jehovah, And they say, `[It is] not  He, Nor come in against us doth evil, Yea, sword and famine we  do not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the prophets become wind, And the word is not in them,`  -- thus it is done by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, thus said Jehovah, God of Hosts, Because of your  speaking this word, Lo, I am making My words in thy mouth  become fire, And this people wood, and it hath devoured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lo, I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house  of Israel, an affirmation of Jehovah, A nation -- strong it  [is], a nation -- from of old it [is], A nation -- thou knowest  not its tongue, Nor understandest what it speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Its quiver [is] as an open sepulchre, All of them -- mighty  ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it hath consumed thy harvest and thy bread, They  consume thy sons, and thy daughters, It consumeth thy flock,  and thy herd, It consumeth thy vine, and thy fig-tree, It  maketh poor thy fenced cities, In which thou art trusting -- by  the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And even in those days, an affirmation of Jehovah, I do not  make you a completion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it hath come to pass, when ye say, `For what hath  Jehovah our God done to us all these?` That thou hast said unto  them, `As ye have forsaken Me, And serve the gods of a  foreigner in your land, So do ye serve strangers in a land not  yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, And sound ye it in  Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hear ye, I pray you, this, O people, foolish and without  heart, Eyes they have, and they see not, Ears they have, and  they hear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Me do ye not fear, an affirmation of Jehovah? From My  presence are ye not pained? Who hath made sand the border of  the sea, A limit age-during, and it passeth not over it, They  shake themselves, and they are not able, Yea, sounded have its  billows, and they pass not over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this people hath an apostate and rebellious heart, They  have turned aside, and they go on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they have not said in their heart, `Let us fear, we  pray you, Jehovah our God, who is giving rain, The sprinkling  and the gathered, in its season, The appointed weeks of harvest  He keepeth for us.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your iniquities have turned these away, And your sins have  kept the good from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the wicked have been found among My people. It looketh  about the covering of snares, They have set up a trap -- men  they capture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As a cage full of fowls, So their houses are full of  deceit, Therefore they have been great, and are rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They have been fat, they have shone, Yea, they have  overpassed the acts of the evil, Judgment they have not judged,  The judgment of the fatherless -- and they prosper, And the  judgment of the needy they have not judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For these do not I inspect, an affirmation of Jehovah, On a  nation such as this, Doth not My soul avenge itself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>An astonishing and horrible thing hath been in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The prophets have prophesied falsely, And the priests bear  rule by their means, And My people have loved [it] so, And what  do they at its latter end?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
