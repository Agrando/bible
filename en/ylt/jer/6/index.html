Wo to us, for turned hath the day, For stretched out are  the shades of evening,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>`Rise, and we go up by night, And we destroy her palaces.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Cut down her wood, And pour  out against Jerusalem a mount, She [is] the city to be  inspected, Wholly -- she is oppression in her midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As the digging of a well, is [for] its waters, So she hath  digged [for] her wickedness, Violence and spoil is heard in  her, Before My face continually [are] sickness and smiting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be instructed, O Jerusalem, Lest My soul be alienated from  thee, Lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: They surely glean, as a vine,  the remnant of Israel, Put back thy hand, as a gatherer to the  baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom do I speak, and testify, and they hear? Lo, their  ear [is] uncircumcised, And they are not able to attend. Lo, a  word of Jehovah hath been to them for a reproach, They delight  not in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And with the fury of Jehovah I have been filled, (I have  been weary of containing,) To pour [it] on the suckling in the  street, And on the assembly of youths together, For even  husband with wife are captured, An elder with one full of days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their houses have been turned to others, Fields and  wives together, For I stretch out My hand against the  inhabitants of the land, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For from their least unto their greatest, Every one is  gaining dishonest gain, And from prophet even unto priest,  Every one is dealing falsely,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people  slightly, Saying, `Peace, peace!` and there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea, they are  not at all ashamed, Yea, blushing they have not known,  Therefore they do fall among those falling, In the time I have  inspected them, They stumble, said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus said Jehovah: Stand ye by the ways and see, and ask  for paths of old, Where [is] this -- the good way? and go ye in  it, And find rest for yourselves. And they say, `We do not go.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I have raised up for you watchmen, Attend ye to the  voice of the trumpet. And they say, `We do not attend.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O company, That which  [is] upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, O earth, lo, I am bringing evil on this people, The  fruit of their devices, For to My words they gave no attention,  And My law -- they kick against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Why [is] this to Me? frankincense from Sheba cometh, And  the sweet cane from a land afar off, Your burnt-offerings [are]  not for acceptance, And your sacrifices have not been sweet to  Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus said Jehovah: Lo, I do give to this people  stumbling blocks, And stumbled against them have fathers and  sons together, The neighbour and his friend do perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus said Jehovah: Lo, a people hath come from a north  country, And a great nation is stirred up from the sides of the  earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Bow and javelin they take hold of, Fierce it [is], and they  have no mercy, Their voice as a sea doth sound, And on horses  they ride, set in array as a man of war, Against thee, O  daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`We have heard its sound, feeble have been our hands,  Distress hath seized us, pain as of a travailing woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Go not forth to the field, And in the way walk not, For a  sword hath the enemy, fear [is] round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>O daughter of My people, Gird on sackcloth, and roll  thyself in ashes, The mourning of an only one make for thee, A  lamentation most bitter, For suddenly come doth the spoiler  against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A watch-tower I have given thee, Among My people a  fortress, And thou knowest, and hast tried their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All of them are turned aside by apostates, Walking  slanderously -- brass and iron, All of them are corrupters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows have been burnt, By fire hath the lead been  consumed, In vain hath a refiner refined, And the wicked have  not been drawn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`Silver rejected,` they have called to them, For Jehovah  hath kicked against them!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
