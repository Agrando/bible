Who hath regarded My word, and  hearkeneth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lo, a whirlwind of Jehovah -- Fury hath gone out, even a  piercing whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of Jehovah doth not turn back Till His doing,  and till His establishing, The thoughts of His heart, In the  latter end of the days ye attend to it With understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not sent the prophets, and they have run, I have  not spoken unto them, and they have prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But -- if they stood in My counsel, Then they cause My  people to hear My words, And they turn them back from their  evil way, And from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A God near [am] I -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And not a  God afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Is any one hidden in secret places, And I see him not? an  affirmation of Jehovah, Do not I fill the heavens and the  earth? An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard that which the prophets said, Who prophesy in  My name falsehood, saying, `I have dreamed, I have dreamed.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Till when is it in the heart of the prophets? The prophets  of falsehood, Yea, prophets of the deceit of their heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who are devising to cause My people To forget My name by  their dreams, That they recount each to his neighbour, As their  fathers forgot my name for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet with whom [is] a dream, Let him recount the  dream, And he with whom [is] My word, Let him truly speak My  word. What -- to the straw with the corn? An affirmation of  Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is it not thus? My word [is] as a fire, An affirmation of  Jehovah. And as a hammer -- it breaketh in pieces a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, lo, I [am] against the prophets, An affirmation  of Jehovah, Stealing My words each from his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Lo, I [am] against the prophets, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Who are making smooth their tongue, And they affirm --  an affirmation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Lo, I [am] against the prophets of false dreams, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And they recount them, and cause my  people to err, By their falsehoods, and by their instability,  And I -- I have not sent them, Nor have I commanded them, And  they are not at all profitable to this people, An affirmation  of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this people, or the prophet, Or a priest, doth  ask thee, saying, What [is] the burden of Jehovah? Then thou  hast said unto them: Ye [are] the burden, and I have left you,  An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the prophet, and the priest, and the people, That  saith, The burden of Jehovah, I have seen after that man, and  after his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus do ye say each unto his neighbour, And each unto his  brother: What hath Jehovah answered? And what hath Jehovah  spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the burden of Jehovah ye do not mention any more, For  the burden to each is -- His word, And ye have overturned the  words of the living God, Jehovah of Hosts, our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus dost thou say unto the prophet What hath Jehovah  answered thee? And what hath Jehovah spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if the burden of Jehovah ye say, Therefore thus said  Jehovah: Because of your saying this word, The burden of  Jehovah, And I do send unto you, saying, Ye do not say, The  burden of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, lo, I -- I have taken you utterly away, And I  have sent you out, And the city that I gave to you, And to your  fathers, from before My face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I have put on you reproach age-during, And shame  age-during that is not forgotten!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
