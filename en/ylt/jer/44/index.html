Jeremiah concerning all the  Jews who are dwelling in the land of Egypt -- who are dwelling  in Migdol, and in Tahpanhes, and in Noph, and in the land of  Pathros -- saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Ye -- ye have  seen all the evil that I have brought in on Jerusalem, and on  all the cities of Judah, and lo, they [are] a waste this day,  and there is none dwelling in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>because of their wickedness that they have done, by  provoking Me to anger, by going to make perfume, by serving  other gods, that they knew not, they, ye, and your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>`And I send unto you all my servants, the prophets, rising  early and sending, saying: I pray you, do not this abomination  that I have hated --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, to turn  back from their wickedness, not to make perfume to other gods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and poured out is My fury, and Mine anger, and it burneth  in cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, and they are  for a waste, for a desolation, as [at] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`And, now, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Why  are ye doing great evil unto your own souls, to cut off to you  man and woman, infant and suckling, from the midst of Judah, so  as not to leave to you a remnant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>by provoking Me to anger by the works of your hands, by  making perfume to other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye  are going in to sojourn, so as to cut yourselves off, and so as  to your being for a reviling and for a reproach among all  nations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the  wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their  wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your  wives, that they have done in the land of Judah, and in streets  of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have not been humbled unto this day, nor have they  been afraid, nor have they walked in My law, and in My  statutes, that I have set before you and before your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo,  I am setting my face against you for evil, even to cut off all  Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I have taken the remnant of Judah, who have set their  faces to enter the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they  have all been consumed in the land of Egypt; they fall by  sword, by famine they are consumed, from the least even unto  the greatest, by sword and by famine they die, and they have  been for an execration, for an astonishment, and for a  reviling, and for a reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`And I have seen after those dwelling in the land of  Egypt, as I saw after Jerusalem, with sword, with famine, and  with pestilence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and there is not an escaped and remaining one of the  remnant of Judah, who are entering into the land of Egypt to  sojourn there, even to turn back to the land of Judah, whither  they are lifting up their soul to return to dwell, for they do  not turn back, except those escaping.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they answer Jeremiah -- all the men who are knowing  that their wives are making perfume to other gods, and all the  women who are remaining, a great assembly, even all the people  who are dwelling in the land of Egypt, in Pathros -- saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`The word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of  Jehovah -- we are not hearkening unto thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for we certainly do everything that hath gone out of our  mouth, to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour  out to her libations, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our  kings, and our heads, in cities of Judah, and in streets of  Jerusalem, and -- we are satisfied with bread, and we are well,  and evil we have not seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`And from the time we have ceased to make perfume to the  queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations, we have  lacked all, and by sword and by famine we have been consumed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and when we are making perfume to the queen of the  heavens, and pouring out to her libations -- without our  husbands have we made for her cakes to idolize her, and to pour  out to her libations?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jeremiah saith unto all the people, concerning the men  and concerning the women, and concerning all the people who are  answering him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`The perfume that ye made in the cities of Judah, and in  the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and  your heads, and the people of the land, hath not Jehovah  remembered it? yea, it cometh up on His heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah is not able any more to accept [you], because  of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations that ye  have done, and your land is for a waste, and for an  astonishment, and for a reviling, without inhabitant, as [at]  this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`Because that ye have made perfume, and because ye have  sinned against Jehovah, and have not hearkened to the voice of  Jehovah, and in His law, and in His statutes, and in His  testimonies ye have not walked, therefore hath this evil met  you as [at] this day.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jeremiah saith unto all the people, and unto all the  women, `Hear ye a word of Jehovah, all Judah who [are] in the  land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, saying: Ye and  your wives both speak with your mouth, and with your hands have  fulfilled, saying: We certainly execute our vows that we have  vowed, to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour  out to her libations, ye do certainly establish your vows, and  certainly execute your vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`Therefore, hear ye a word of Jehovah, all Judah who are  dwelling in the land of Egypt: Lo, I -- I have sworn by My  great name, said Jehovah, My name is no more proclaimed by the  mouth of any man of Judah, saying, Live doth the Lord Jehovah  -- in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Lo, I am watching over them for evil, and not for good,  and consumed have been all the men of Judah who [are] in the  land of Egypt, by sword and by famine, till their consumption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`And the escaped of the sword turn back out of the land of  Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number, and known have all  the remnant of Judah who are coming into the land of Egypt to  sojourn there, whose word is established, Mine or theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`And this [is] to you the sign -- an affirmation of  Jehovah -- that I am seeing after you in this place, so that ye  know that My words are certainly established against you for  evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am giving Pharaoh-Hophra king of  Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those  seeking his life, as I have given Zedekiah king of Judah into  the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and who  is seeking his life.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
