Greatly defiled is not that land? And thou hast  committed whoredom with many lovers, And turn again to Me, an  affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Lift thine eyes to the high places, and see, Where hast thou  not been lain with? On the ways thou hast sat for them, As an  Arab in a wilderness, And thou defilest the land, By thy  fornications, and by thy wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And withheld are showers, and gathered rain hath not been.  The forehead of a whorish woman thou hast, Thou hast refused to  be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hast thou not henceforth called to Me, `My father, Thou  [art] the leader of my youth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Doth He keep to the age? watch for ever?` Lo, these things  thou hast spoken, And thou dost the evil things, and  prevailest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah saith unto me, in the days of Josiah the king,  `Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? She is  going on every high mountain, and unto the place of every green  tree, and committeth fornication there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I say, after her doing all these, Unto Me thou dost turn  back, and she hath not turned back, and see [it] doth her  treacherous sister Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I see when (for all the causes whereby backsliding  Israel committed adultery) I have sent her away, and I give the  bill of her divorce unto her, that treacherous Judah her sister  hath not feared, and goeth and committeth fornication -- she  also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it hath come to pass, from the vileness of her  fornication, that the land is defiled, and she committeth  fornication with stone and with wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And even in all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not  turned back unto Me with all her heart, but with falsehood, an  affirmation of Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah saith unto me: `Justified herself hath  backsliding Israel, More than treacherous Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go, and thou hast proclaimed these words toward the north,  and hast said, Turn back, O backsliding Israel, An affirmation  of Jehovah! I cause not Mine anger to fall upon you, For I [am]  kind, an affirmation of Jehovah, I watch not to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Only, know thine iniquity, For against Jehovah thy God thou  hast transgressed, And thou dost scatter thy ways to strangers,  Under every green tree, And to My voice thou hast not  hearkened, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Turn back, O backsliding sons, An affirmation of Jehovah.
