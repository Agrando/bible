fourth year of Jehoiakim son  of Josiah king of Judah, this word hath been unto Jeremiah from  Jehovah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>`Take to thee a roll of a book, and thou hast written on it  all the words that I have spoken unto thee concerning Israel,  and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the  day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this  day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>if so be the house of Israel do hear all the evil that I am  thinking of doing to them, so that they turn back each from is  evil way, and I have been propitious to their iniquity, and to  their sin.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jeremiah calleth Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch  writeth from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah,  that He hath spoken unto him, on a roll of a book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jeremiah commandeth Baruch, saying, `I am restrained, I  am not able to enter the house of Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but thou hast entered -- and thou hast read in the roll  that thou hast written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah, in  the ears of the people, in the house of Jehovah, in the day of  the fast, and also in the ears of all Judah who are coming in  from their cities thou dost read them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>if so be their supplication doth fall before Jehovah, and  they turn back each from his evil way, for great [is] the anger  and the fury that Jehovah hath spoken concerning this people.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Baruch son of Neriah doth according to all that  Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, to read in the book the  words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it cometh to pass, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son  of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, proclaimed a fast  before Jehovah have all the people in Jerusalem, and all the  people who are coming in from cities of Judah to Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Baruch readeth in the book the words of Jeremiah in  the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan  the scribe, in the higher court, at the opening of the new gate  of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Michaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heareth all  the words of Jehovah from off the book,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he goeth down [to] the house of the king, unto the  chamber of the scribe, and lo, there are all the heads sitting:  Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan  son of Acbor, and Gemariah son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah son of  Hananiah, and all the heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And declare to them doth Micaiah all the words that he  hath heard, when Baruch readeth in the book in the ears of the  people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and all the heads send unto Baruch, Jehudi son of  Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, saying, `The roll in  which thou hast read in the ears of the people take in thy  hand, and come.` And Baruch son of Neriah taketh the roll in  his hand and cometh in unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and they say unto him, `Sit down, we pray thee, and read  it in our ears,` and Baruch readeth in their ears,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and it cometh to pass, when they hear all the words, they  have been afraid one at another, and say unto Baruch, `We do  surely declare to the king all these words.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they asked Baruch, saying, `Declare, we pray thee, to  us, how didst thou write all these words -- from his mouth?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Baruch saith to them, `From his mouth, he pronounceth  unto me all these words, and I am writing on the book with  ink.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the heads say unto Baruch, `Go, be hidden, thou and  Jeremiah, and let no one know where ye [are].`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they go in unto the king, to the court, and the roll  they have laid up in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and  they declare in the ears of the king all the words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king sendeth Jehudi to take the roll, and he  taketh it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and Jehudi  readeth it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the  heads who are standing by the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the king is sitting in the winter-house, in the ninth  month, and the stove before him is burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and it cometh to pass, when Jehudi readeth three or four  leaves, he cutteth it out with the scribe`s knife, and hath  cast unto the fire, that [is] on the stove, till the  consumption of all the roll by the fire that [is] on the stove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king and all his servants who are hearing all  these words have not been afraid, nor rent their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And also Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah have  interceded with the king not to burn the roll, and he hath not  hearkened unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king commandeth Jerahmeel son of Hammelek, and  Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to take  Baruch the scribe, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Jehovah doth  hide them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah -- after the  king`s burning the roll, even the words that Baruch hath  written from the mouth of Jeremiah -- saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`Turn, take to thee another roll, and write on it all the  former words that were on the first roll, that Jehoiakim king  of Judah burnt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and unto Jehoiakim king of Judah thou dost say: Thus said  Jehovah, Thou hast burnt this roll, saying, Wherefore hast thou  written on it, saying, The king of Babylon surely cometh in,  and hath destroyed this land, and caused to cease from it man  and beast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`Therefore, thus said Jehovah, concerning Jehoiakim king  of Judah: He hath none sitting on the throne of David, and his  carcase is cast out to heat by day, and to cold by night;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and I have charged on him, and on his seed, and on his  servants, their iniquity; and I have brought in on them, and on  the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto the men of Judah, all  the evil that I have spoken unto them, and they hearkened not.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jeremiah hath taken another roll, and giveth it unto  Baruch son of Neriah the scribe, and he writeth on it from the  mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king  of Judah hath burnt in the fire; and again there were added  unto them many words like these.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
