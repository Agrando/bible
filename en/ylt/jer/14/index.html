They have  been ashamed, And have blushed and covered their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because the ground hath been broken, For there hath been no  rain in the land, Ashamed have been husbandmen, They have  covered their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even the hind in the field hath brought forth -- to  forsake [it!] For there hath been no grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And wild asses have stood on high places, They have  swallowed up wind like dragons, Consumed have been their eyes,  for there is no herb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Surely our iniquities have testified against us, O Jehovah,  work for Thy name`s sake, For many have been our backslidings,  Against Thee we have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O Hope of Israel -- its saviour in time of trouble, Why art  Thou as a sojourner in the land? And as a traveller turned  aside to lodge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Why art Thou as one dumb? As a mighty one not able to save?  And Thou [art] in our midst, O Jehovah, And Thy name over us is  called, leave us not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus said Jehovah concerning this people: Well they have  loved to wander, Their feet they have not restrained, And  Jehovah hath not accepted them, Now doth He remember their  iniquity, And inspect their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah saith unto me: Thou dost not pray for this  people for good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they fast, I hearken not unto their cry, And when  they cause to ascend burnt-offering and present, I accept them  not, For by sword, and by famine, And by pestilence, I am  consuming them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, Lo, the prophets are saying  to them: Ye do not see a sword, yea, famine is not to you, For  true peace I give to you in this place.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah saith unto me: Falsehood the prophets are  prophesying in My name, I did not send them, nor command them,  Nor have I spoken unto them: A false vision, and divination,  and vanity, And the deceit of their own heart, they are  prophesying to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, thus said Jehovah concerning the prophets who  are prophesying in My name, and I have not sent them, and they  are saying, Sword and famine is not in this land: By sword and  by famine are these prophets consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people to whom they are prophesying, Are cast into  out-places of Jerusalem, Because of the famine, and of the  sword, And they have none burying them, Them, their wives, and  their sons, and their daughters, And I have poured out upon  them this evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And thou hast said unto them this word: Tears come down  mine eyes night and day, And they do not cease, For, [with] a  great breach, Broken hath been the virgin daughter of my  people, A very grievous stroke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I have gone forth to the field, Then, lo, the pierced  of the sword! And if I have entered the city, Then, lo, the  diseased of famine! For both prophet and priest have gone up  and down Unto a land that they knew not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Zion hath Thy soul  loathed? Wherefore hast Thou smitten us, And there is no  healing to us? Looking for peace, and there is no good, And for  a time of healing, and lo, terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We have known, O Jehovah, our wickedness, The iniquity of  our fathers, For we have sinned against Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not despise, for Thy name`s sake, Dishonour not the  throne of Thine honour, Remember, break not Thy covenant with  us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there among the vanities of the nations any causing  rain? And do the heavens give showers? Art not Thou He, O  Jehovah our God? And we wait for thee, for Thou -- Thou hast  done all these!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
