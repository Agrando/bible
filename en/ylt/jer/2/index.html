And the shepherds  transgressed against Me, And the prophets have prophesied by  Baal, And after those who profit not have gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, yet I plead with you, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And with your sons` sons I plead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, pass to the isles of Chittim, and see, And to Kedar  send, and consider well, And see if there hath been like this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Hath a nation changed gods? (And they [are] no gods!) And  My people hath changed its honour For that which doth not  profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, Yea, be frightened, be  greatly wasted, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For two evils hath My people done, Me they have forsaken, a  fountain of living waters, To hew out for themselves wells --  broken wells, That contain not the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A servant [is] Israel? Is he a child of the house?  Wherefore hath he been for a prey?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Against him roar do young lions, They have given forth  their voice, And make his land become a desolation, His cities  have been burnt without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also sons of Noph and Tahapanes Consume thee -- the crown  of the head!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Dost thou not do this to thyself? [By] thy forsaking  Jehovah thy God, At the time He is leading thee in the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now, what -- to thee in the way of Egypt, To drink the  waters of Sihor? And what -- to thee in the way of Asshur, To  drink the waters of the River?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Instruct thee doth thy wickedness, And thy backslidings  reprove thee, Know and see that an evil and a bitter thing [Is]  thy forsaking Jehovah thy God, And My fear not being on thee,  An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For from of old thou hast broken thy yoke, Drawn away thy  bands, and sayest, `I do not serve,` For, on every high height,  and under every green tree, Thou art wandering -- a harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I planted thee a choice vine, wholly a true seed, And  how hast thou been turned to Me, To the degenerate shoots of a  strange vine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But though thou dost wash with nitre, And dost multiply to  thyself soap, Marked is thine iniquity before Me, An  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How sayest thou, `I have not been defiled, After the Baalim  I have not gone?` See thy way in a valley, know what thou hast  done, A swift dromedary winding her ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A wild ass accustomed to a wilderness, In the desire of her  soul she hath swallowed up wind, Her meeting -- who doth turn  her back? None seeking her do weary themselves, In her month  they find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Withhold thy foot from being unshod, And thy throat from  thirst, And thou sayest, `It is incurable, No, for I have loved  strangers, and after them I go.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the shame of a thief when he is found, So put to shame  have been the house of Israel, They, their kings, their heads,  And their priests, and their prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Saying to wood, `My father [art] thou!` And to a stone,  `Thou hast brought me forth,` For they turned unto me the back  and not the face, And in the time of their vexation, They say,  `Arise Thou, and save us.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And where [are] thy gods, that thou hast made to thyself?  Let them arise, if they may save thee, In the time of thy  vexation, For -- the number of thy cities have been thy gods, O  Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why do ye strive with Me? All of you have transgressed  against Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In vain I have smitten your sons, Instruction they have not  accepted, Devoured hath your sword your prophets, As a  destroying lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah: A wilderness have  I been to Israel? A land of thick darkness? Wherefore have My  people said, `We mourned, We come not in again unto Thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Doth a virgin forget her ornaments? A bride her bands? And  My people have forgotten Me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>What -- dost thou make pleasing thy ways to seek love?  Therefore even the wicked thou hast taught thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also in thy skirts hath been found the blood of innocent  needy souls, Not by digging have I found them, but upon all  these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And thou sayest, `Because I have been innocent, Surely  turned back hath His anger from me?` Lo, I have been judged  with thee, Because of thy saying, `I have not sinned.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What? thou art very vile to repeat thy way, Even of Egypt  thou art ashamed, As thou hast been ashamed of Asshur,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also from this thou goest out, And thy hands on thy head,  For Jehovah hath kicked at thy confidences, And thou dost not  give prosperity to them!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
