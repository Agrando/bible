And I answer and say, `Amen, O Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah saith unto me, `Proclaim all these words in the  cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear  ye the words of this covenant, And ye have done them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I certainly testified against your fathers, In the day  of My bringing them up out of the land of Egypt -- till this  day, Rising early and testifying, saying, Hearken to My voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, And  they walk each in the stubbornness of their evil heart, And I  bring on them all the words of this covenant, That I commanded  to do, and they did not.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah saith unto me: `A conspiracy is found in the  men of Judah, And in the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have turned back to the iniquities of their first  fathers, Who refused to hear My words, And they have gone after  other gods to serve them, The house of Israel, and the house of  Judah, Have made void My covenant, that I made with their  fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am bringing in unto  them evil, That they are not able to go out from, And they have  cried unto Me, And I do not hearken unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the cities of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem have  gone, And they have cried unto the gods, To whom they are  making perfume, And they give no deliverance at all to them, In  the time of their vexation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For -- the number of thy cities have been thy gods, O  Judah, And -- the number of the streets of Jerusalem Ye have  placed altars to a shameful thing, Altars to make perfume to  Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou, thou dost not pray for this people, Nor dost  thou lift up for them cry and prayer, For I do not hearken in  the time of their calling unto Me for their vexation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What -- to My beloved in My house, Her doing wickedness  with many, And the holy flesh do pass over from thee? When thou  dost evil, then thou exultest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`An olive, green, fair, of goodly fruit,` Hath Jehovah  called thy name, At the noise of a great tumult He hath kindled  fire against it, And broken have been its thin branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah of Hosts, who is planting thee, Hath spoken  evil concerning thee, For the evil of the house of Israel, and  of the house of Judah, That they have done to themselves, To  provoke Me to anger, to make perfume to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, O Jehovah, cause me to know, and I know, Then Thou  hast showed me their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I [am] as a trained lamb brought to slaughter, And I  have not known That against me they have devised devices: We  destroy the tree with its food, and cut him off From the land  of the living, And his name is not remembered again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And O Jehovah of Hosts, judging righteousness, Trying  reins and heart, I do see Thy vengeance against them, For unto  Thee I have revealed my cause.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, thus said Jehovah concerning the men of  Anathoth, who are seeking thy life, saying: Do not prophesy in  the name of Jehovah, And thou dost not die by our hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts: `Lo, I am seeing  after them, The chosen ones die by sword, Their sons and their  daughters die by famine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they have no remnant, For I bring evil unto the men of  Anathoth, The year of their inspection!`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
