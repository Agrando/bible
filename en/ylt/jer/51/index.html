stirring up against Babylon,  And the inhabitants of Leb -- My withstanders, A destroying  wind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I have sent to Babylon fanners, And they have fanned  it, and they empty its land, For they have been against it,  Round about -- in the day of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Let not the treader tread his bow, Nor lift himself up in  his coat of mail, Nor have ye pity on her young men, Devote ye  to destruction all her host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And fallen have the wounded in the land of the Chaldeans,  And the pierced-through in her streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For, not forsaken is Israel and Judah, By its God -- by  Jehovah of Hosts, For their land hath been full of guilt,  Against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, And deliver ye each his  soul, Be not cut off in its iniquity, For a time of vengeance  it [is] to Jehovah, Recompence He is rendering to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A golden cup [is] Babylon in the hand of Jehovah, Making  drunk all the earth, Of its wine drunk have nations, Therefore  boast themselves do nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Suddenly hath Babylon fallen, Yea, it is broken, howl ye  for it, Take balm for her pain, if so be it may be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We healed Babylon, and she was not healed, Forsake her, and  we go, each to his land, For come unto the heavens hath its  judgment, And it hath been lifted up unto the clouds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousnesses, Come, and  we recount in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Cleanse ye the arrows, fill the shields, Stirred up hath  Jehovah the spirit of the kings of Madia, For against Babylon  His device [is] to destroy it, For the vengeance of Jehovah it  [is], The vengeance of His temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Unto the walls of Babylon lift up an ensign, Strengthen  the watch, Establish the watchers, prepare the ambush, For  Jehovah hath both devised and done that which He spake,  Concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O dweller on many waters, abundant in treasures, Come in  hath thine end, the measure of thy dishonest gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Sworn hath Jehovah of Hosts by Himself, That, Surely I  have filled thee [with] men as the cankerworm, And they have  cried against thee -- shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The maker of earth by His power, The establisher of the  world by His wisdom, Who by His understanding stretched out the  heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At the voice He giveth forth, A multitude of waters [are]  in the heavens, And He causeth vapours to come up from the end  of the earth, Lightnings for rain He hath made, And He bringeth  out wind from His treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Brutish hath been every man by knowledge, Put to shame  hath been every refiner by a graven image, For false [is] his  molten image, And there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Vanity [are] they -- work of errors, In the time of their  inspection they perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Not like these [is] the portion of Jacob, For He [is]  former of all things, And [Israel is] the rod of His  inheritance, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>An axe [art] thou to me -- weapons of war, And I have  broken in pieces by thee nations, And I have destroyed by thee  kingdoms,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I have broken in pieces by thee horse and its rider,  And I have broken in pieces by thee chariot and its charioteer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I have broken in pieces by thee man and woman, And I  have broken in pieces by thee old and young, And I have broken  in pieces by thee young man and virgin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I have broken in pieces by thee shepherd and his  drove, And I have broken in pieces by thee husbandman and his  team, And I have broken in pieces by thee governors and  prefects.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I have recompensed to Babylon, And to all inhabitants  of Chaldea, All the evil that they have done in Zion, Before  your eyes -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Lo, I [am] against thee, O destroying mount, An  affirmation of Jehovah, That is destroying all the earth, And I  have stretched out My hand against thee, And I have rolled thee  from the rocks, And given thee for a burnt mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they take not out of thee a stone for a corner, And a  stone for foundations, For desolations age-during art thou, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Lift ye up an ensign in the land, Blow a trumpet among  nations, Sanctify against it nations, Summon against it the  kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz, Appoint against it an  infant head, Cause the horse to ascend as the rough cankerworm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Sanctify against it the nations with the kings of Media,  Its governors and all its prefects, And all the land of its  dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And shake doth the land, and it is pained, For stood  against Babylon have the purposes of Jehovah, To make the land  of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Ceased have the mighty of Babylon to fight, They have  remained in strongholds, Failed hath their might, they have  become woman, They have burnt her tabernacles, Broken have been  her bars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Runner to meet runner doth run, And announcer to meet  announcer, To announce to the king of Babylon, For, captured  hath been his city -- at the extremity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the passages have been captured, And the reeds they  have burnt with fire, And the men of war have been troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, The  daughter of Babylon [is] as a threshing-floor, The time of her  threshing -- yet a little, And come hath the time of her  harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Devoured us, crushed us, hath Nebuchadrezzar king of  Babylon, He hath set us [as] an empty vessel, He hath swallowed  us as a dragon, He hath filled his belly with my dainties, He  hath driven us away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>My wrong, and [that of] my flesh [is] on Babylon, Say doth  the inhabitant of Zion, And my blood [is] on the inhabitants of  Chaldea, Say doth Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore, thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am pleading thy cause,  And I have avenged thy vengeance, And dried up its sea, and  made its fountains dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Babylon hath been for heaps, A habitation of dragons,  An astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Together as young lions they roar, They have shaken  themselves as lions` whelps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>In their heat I make their banquets, And I have caused  them to drink, so that they exult, And have slept a sleep  age-during, And awake not -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I cause them to go down as lambs to slaughter, As rams  with he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>How hath Sheshach been captured, Yea, caught is the praise  of the whole earth, How hath Babylon been for an astonishment  among nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Come up against Babylon hath the sea, With a multitude of  its billows it hath been covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Its cities have been for a desolation, A dry land, and a  wilderness, A land -- none doth dwell in them, Nor pass over  into them doth a son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I have seen after Bel in Babylon, And I have brought  forth that which he swallowed -- from his mouth, And flow no  more unto him do nations, Also the wall of Babylon hath fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Go forth from its midst, O My people, And deliver ye, each  his soul, Because of the fierceness of the anger of Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And lest your heart be tender, And ye be afraid of the  report that is heard in the land, And come in a year hath the  report, And after it in a year the report, And violence [is] in  the land, ruler against ruler;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore, lo, days are coming, And I have seen after the  graven images of Babylon. And all its land is ashamed, And all  its pierced ones do fall in its midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And cried aloud against Babylon Have heavens and earth,  and all that [is] in them, For, from the north come to it do  the spoilers, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Even Babylon [is] to fall, ye pierced of Israel, Even they  of Babylon have fallen, Ye pierced of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Ye escaped of the sword, go on, stand not, Remember ye  from afar Jehovah, And let Jerusalem come up on your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>We have been ashamed, for we heard reproach, Covered hath  shame our faces, For come in have strangers, against the  sanctuaries of the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And I have seen after its graven images, And in all its land  groan doth the wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Because Babylon goeth up to the heavens, And because it  fenceth the high place of its strength, From Me come into it do  spoilers, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>A voice of a cry [is] from Babylon, And of great  destruction from the land of the Chaldean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For Jehovah is spoiling Babylon, And hath destroyed out of  it a great voice, And sounded have its billows as many waters,  Given forth a noise hath their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For come in against it -- against Babylon -- hath a  spoiler, And captured have been its mighty ones, Broken have  been their bows, For the God of recompences -- Jehovah -- doth  certainly repay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And I have caused its princes to drink, And its wise men,  its governors, And its prefects, and its mighty ones, And they  have slept a sleep age-during, And they awake not -- an  affirmation of the king, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, the wall of Babylon -- The  broad one -- is utterly made bare, And her high gates with fire  are burnt, And peoples labour in vain, And nations in fire, and  have been weary!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath commanded Seraiah  son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, in his going with Zedekiah king  of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign -- and  Seraiah [is] a quiet prince;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and Jeremiah writeth all the evil that cometh unto Babylon  on one book -- all these words that are written concerning  Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Jeremiah saith unto Seraiah, `When thou dost enter  Babylon, then thou hast seen, and hast read all these words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>and hast said: Jehovah, Thou, Thou hast spoken concerning  this place, to cut it off, that there is none dwelling in it,  from man even unto cattle, for it is a desolation age-during.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it hath come to pass, when thou dost finish reading  this book, thou dost bind to it a stone, and hast cast it into  the midst of Phrat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and said, Thus sink doth Babylon, and it doth not arise,  because of the evil that I am bringing in against it, and they  have been weary.` Hitherto [are] words of Jeremiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
