Doth he turn back, and not return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore hath this people of Jerusalem Turned back -- a  perpetual backsliding? They have kept hold on deceit, They have  refused to turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have given attention, yea, I hearken, They do not speak  right, No man hath repented of his wickedness, Saying, What  have I done? Every one hath turned to his courses, As a horse  is rushing into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Even a stork in the heavens hath known her seasons, And  turtle, and swallow, and crane, Have watched the time of their  coming, And -- My people have not known the judgment of  Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How do ye say, We [are] wise, And the law of Jehovah [is]  with us? Surely, lo, falsely it hath wrought, The false pen of  scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ashamed have been the wise, They have been affrighted, and  are captured, Lo, against a word of Jehovah they kicked, And  the wisdom of what -- have they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, I give their wives to others, Their fields to  dispossessors, For from the least even unto the greatest, Every  one is gaining dishonest gain, From prophet even unto priest,  every one is dealing falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people  slightly, Saying, Peace, peace! and there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea, they are  not at all ashamed, And blushing they have not known,  Therefore, they do fall among falling ones, In the time of  their inspection they stumble, said Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I utterly consume them, an affirmation of Jehovah, There  are no grapes in the vine, Yea, there are no figs in the  fig-tree, And the leaf hath faded, And the strength they have  passeth from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore are we sitting still? Be gathered, and we go in  to the fenced cities, And we are silent there, For Jehovah our  God hath made us silent, Yea, He causeth us to drink water of  gall, For we have sinned against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Looking for peace -- and there is no good, For a time of  healing, and lo, terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From Dan hath been heard the snorting of his horses, From  the voice of the neighings of his mighty ones, Trembled hath  all the land, And they come in and consume the land and its  fulness, The city and the inhabitants in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, lo, I am sending among you serpents, Vipers that have  no charmer, And they have bitten you, an affirmation of  Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My refreshing for me [is] sorrow, For me my heart [is]  sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lo, the voice of a cry of the daughter of my people from a  land afar off, Is Jehovah not in Zion? is her king not in her?  Wherefore have they provoked Me with their graven images, With  the vanities of a foreigner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Harvest hath passed, summer hath ended, And we -- we have  not been saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For a breach of the daughter of my people have I been  broken, I have been black, astonishment hath seized me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?  For wherefore hath not the health of the daughter of my people  gone up?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
