I am pained [at] the walls of my  heart, Make a noise for me doth My heart, I am not silent, For  the voice of a trumpet I have heard, O my soul -- a shout of  battle!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Destruction on destruction is proclaimed, For spoiled hath  been all the land, Suddenly spoiled have been my tents, In a  moment -- my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Till when do I see an ensign? Do I hear the voice of a  trumpet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For my people [are] foolish, me they have not known,  Foolish sons [are] they, yea, they [are] not intelligent, Wise  [are] they to do evil, And to do good they have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I looked [to] the land, and lo, waste and void, And unto  the heavens, and their light is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have looked [to] the mountains, And lo, they are  trembling. And all the hills moved themselves lightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have looked, and lo, man is not, And all fowls of the  heavens have fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have looked, and lo, The fruitful place [is] a  wilderness, And all its cities have been broken down, Because  of Jehovah, Because of the fierceness of His anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thus said Jehovah: All the land is a desolation, but a  completion I make not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this doth the land mourn, And black have been the  heavens above, because I have spoken -- I have purposed, And I  have not repented, Nor do I turn back from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From the voice of the horseman, And of him shooting with  the bow, all the city is fleeing, They have come into thickets,  And on cliffs they have gone up, All the city is forsaken, And  there is no one dwelling in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou, O spoiled one, what dost thou? For thou puttest  on scarlet, For thou adornest thyself [with] ornaments of gold.  For thou rendest with pain thine eyes, In vain thou dost make  thyself fair, Kicked against thee have doting ones, Thy life  they do seek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For a voice as of a sick woman I have heard, Distress, as  of one bringing forth a first-born, The voice of the daughter  of Zion, She bewaileth herself, she spreadeth out her hands,  `Wo to me now, for weary is my soul of slayers!`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
