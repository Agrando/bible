For to Thee it  is becoming, For among all the wise of the nations, And in all  their kingdom there is none like Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in one they are brutish and foolish, An instruction of  vanities [is] the tree itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Spread-out silver from Tarshish is brought, And gold from  Uphaz, Work of an artizan, and of the hands of a refiner, Blue  and purple [is] their clothing, Work of the skilful -- all of  them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah [is] a God of truth, He [is] a living God, and  a king age-during, From His wrath shake doth the earth, And  nations endure not His indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus do ye say to them, The gods Who the heavens and earth  have not made, They do perish from the earth, And from under  these heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The maker of the earth by His power, The establisher of  the world by His wisdom, Who, by His understanding, stretched  forth the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the voice He giveth forth, A multitude of waters [is]  in the heavens, And He causeth vapours to come up from the end  of the earth, Lightnings for rain He hath made, And bringeth  out wind from His treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Brutish is every man by knowledge, Put to shame is every  refiner by a graven image, For false [is] his molten image. And  there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Vanity [are] they, work of erring ones, In the time of  their inspection they perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Not like these [is] the Portion of Jacob, For framer of  all things [is] He, And Israel [is] the rod of His inheritance,  Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather from the land thy merchandise, O dweller in the  bulwark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am slinging out the  inhabitants of the land at this time, And have been an  adversary to them, So that they are found out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wo to me for my breaking, Grievious hath been my smiting,  And I said, Only, this [is] my sickness, and I bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent hath been spoiled, And all my cords have been  broken, My sons have gone out from me, and they are not, There  is none stretching out any more my tent, And raising up my  curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the shepherds have become brutish, And Jehovah they  have not sought, Therefore they have not acted wisely, And all  their flock is scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A voice of a report, lo, it hath come, Even a great  shaking from the north country, To make the cities of Judah a  desolation, A habitation of dragons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I have known, O Jehovah, that not of man [is] his way, Not  of man the going and establishing of his step.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Chastise me, O Jehovah, only in judgment, Not in Thine  anger, lest Thou make me small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out Thy fury on the nations that have not known Thee,  And on the families that have not called in Thy name, For they  have eaten up Jacob, Yea, they have eaten him up, yea, they  consume him, And his habitation they have made desolate!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
