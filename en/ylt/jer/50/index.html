From man even unto beast, They have moved,  they have gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In those days, and at that time, An affirmation of Jehovah,  Come in do sons of Israel, They and sons of Judah together,  Going on and weeping they go, And Jehovah their God they seek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[To] Zion they ask the way, Thitherward [are] their faces:  Come in, and we are joined unto Jehovah, A covenant age-during  -- not forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A perishing flock hath My people been, Their shepherds have  caused them to err, [To] the mountains causing them to go back,  From mountain unto hill they have gone, They have forgotten  their crouching-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All finding them have devoured them, And their adversaries  have said: We are not guilty, Because that they sinned against  Jehovah, The habitation of righteousness, And the hope of their  fathers -- Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Move ye from the midst of Babylon, And from the land of the  Chaldeans go out. And be as he-goats before a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, lo, I am stirring up, And am causing to come up  against Babylon, An assembly of great nations from a land of  the north, And they have set in array against her, From thence  she is captured, Its arrow -- as a skilful hero -- returneth  not empty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Chaldea hath been for a spoil, All her spoilers are  satisfied, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because thou rejoicest, because thou exultest, O spoilers  of Mine inheritance, Because thou increasest as a heifer [at]  the tender grass, And dost cry aloud as bulls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ashamed hath been your mother greatly, Confounded hath she  been that bare you, Lo, the hindermost of nations [is] a  wilderness, A dry land, and a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because of the wrath of Jehovah it is not inhabited, And  it hath been a desolation -- all of it. Every passer by at  Babylon is astonished, And doth hiss because of all her  plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, All  ye treading a bow, Shoot at her, have no pity on the arrow, For  against Jehovah she hath sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shout against her round about, She hath given forth her  hand, Fallen have her foundations, Thrown down have been her  walls, For it [is] the vengeance of Jehovah, Be avenged of her,  as she did -- do ye to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cut off the sower from Babylon, And him handling the  sickle in the time of harvest, Because of the oppressing sword,  Each unto his people -- they turn, And each to his land -- they  flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A scattered sheep is Israel, lions have driven away, At  first, devour him did the king of Asshur, And now, at last,  broken his bone Hath Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I  am seeing after the king of Babylon, And after his land, As I  have seen after the king of Asshur;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I have brought back Israel unto his habitation, And he  hath fed on Carmel, and on Bashan. And in mount Ephraim, and on  Gilead is his soul satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In those days, and at that time, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Sought is the iniquity of Israel, and it is not, And  the sin of Judah, and it is not found, For I am propitious to  those whom I leave!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Against the land of Merathaim: Go up against it, and unto  the inhabitants of Pekod, Waste and devote their posterity, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And do according to all that I have  commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A noise of battle [is] in the land, and of great  destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How hath it been cut and broken, The hammer of the whole  earth!

And who is chosen? on her I lay  a charge, For who [is] like Me? And who doth convene Me? And  who [is] this shepherd who standeth before Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, That He  counselled concerning Babylon, And His devices that He hath  devised Concerning the land of the Chaldeans; Drag them out do  not little ones of the flock, Doth He not make desolate over  them the habitation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>From the voice: Captured was Babylon, Hath the earth been  shaken, And a cry among nations hath been heard!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
