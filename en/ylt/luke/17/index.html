I think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`So also ye, when ye may have done all the things directed  you, say -- We are unprofitable servants, because that which we  owed to do -- we have done.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, in his going on to Jerusalem, that he  passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he entering into a certain village, there met him ten  leprous men, who stood afar off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and they lifted up the voice, saying, `Jesus, master, deal  kindly with us;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and having seen [them], he said to them, `Having gone on,  shew yourselves to the priests;` and it came to pass, in their  going, they were cleansed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and one of them having seen that he was healed did turn  back, with a loud voice glorifying God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he fell upon [his] face at his feet, giving thanks to  him, and he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering said, `Were not the ten cleansed, and  the nine -- where?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There were not found who did turn back to give glory to  God, except this alien;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he said to him, `Having risen, be going on, thy faith  hath saved thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having been questioned by the Pharisees, when the  reign of God doth come, he answered them, and said, `The reign  of God doth not come with observation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor shall they say, Lo, here; or lo, there; for lo, the  reign of God is within you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said unto his disciples, `Days will come, when ye  shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and ye  shall not behold [it];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they shall say to you, Lo, here; or lo, there; ye may  not go away, nor follow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for as the lightning that is lightening out of the one  [part] under heaven, to the other part under heaven doth shine,  so shall be also the Son of Man in his day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and first it behoveth him to suffer many things, and to be  rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And, as it came to pass in the days of Noah, so shall it  be also in the days of the Son of Man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying,  they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah entered  into the ark, and the deluge came, and destroyed all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>in like manner also, as it came to pass in the days of  Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying,  they were selling, they were planting, they were building;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and on the day Lot went forth from Sodom, He rained fire  and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`According to these things it shall be, in the day the Son  of Man is revealed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>in that day, he who shall be on the house top, and his  vessels in the house, let him not come down to take them away;  and he in the field, in like manner, let him not turn backward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>remember the wife of Lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever may seek to save his life, shall lose it; and  whoever may lose it, shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>`I say to you, In that night, there shall be two men on  one couch, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>two women shall be grinding at the same place together,  the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>two men shall be in the field, the one shall be taken, and  the other left.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answering say to him, `Where, sir?` and he said  to them, `Where the body [is], there will the eagles be  gathered together.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
