who is able to  forgive sins, except God only?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus having known their reasonings, answering, said  unto them, `What reason ye in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>which is easier -- to say, Thy sins have been forgiven  thee? or to say, Arise, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`And that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority  upon the earth to forgive sins -- (he said to the one struck  with palsy) -- I say to thee, Arise, and having taken up thy  little couch, be going on to thy house.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And presently having risen before them, having taken up  [that] on which he was lying, he went away to his house,  glorifying God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and astonishment took all, and they were glorifying God,  and were filled with fear, saying -- `We saw strange things  to-day.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after these things he went forth, and beheld a  tax-gatherer, by name Levi, sitting at the tax-office, and said  to him, `Be following me;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he, having left all, having arisen, did follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made a great entertainment to him in his house,  and there was a great multitude of tax-gatherers and others who  were with them reclining (at meat),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the scribes and the Pharisees among them were murmuring  at his disciples, saying, `Wherefore with tax-gatherers and  sinners do ye eat and drink?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus answering said unto them, `They who are well have  no need of a physician, but they that are ill:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I came not to call righteous men, but sinners, to  reformation.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they said unto him, `Wherefore do the disciples of John  fast often, and make supplications -- in like manner also  those of the Pharisees -- but thine do eat and drink?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said unto them, `Are ye able to make the sons of the  bride-chamber -- in the bridegroom being with them -- to fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but days will come, and, when the bridegroom may be taken  away from them, then they shall fast in those days.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he spake also a simile unto them -- `No one a patch of  new clothing doth put on old clothing, and if otherwise, the  new also doth make a rent, and with the old the patch doth not  agree, that [is] from the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>`And no one doth put new wine into old skins, and if  otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will  be poured out, and the skins will be destroyed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but new wine into new skins is to be put, and both are  preserved together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and no one having drunk old [wine], doth immediately wish  new, for he saith, The old is better.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
