government of Tiberius  Caesar -- Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod  tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother, tetrarch of  Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch  of Abilene --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word  of God unto John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he came to all the region round the Jordan, proclaiming  a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>as it hath been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah  the prophet, saying, `A voice of one crying in the wilderness,  Prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill  shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straightness,  and the rough become smooth ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptised  by him, `Brood of vipers! who did prompt you to flee from the  coming wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>make, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation, and begin  not to say within yourselves, We have a father -- Abraham; for  I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise  children to Abraham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid,  every tree, therefore, not making good fruit is cut down, and  to fire it is cast.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the multitudes were questioning him, saying, `What,  then, shall we do?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and he answering saith to them, `He having two coats -- let  him impart to him having none, and he having victuals -- in  like manner let him do.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there came also tax-gatherers to be baptised, and they  said unto him, `Teacher, what shall we do?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he said unto them, `Exact no more than that directed  you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And questioning him also were those warring, saying, `And  we, what shall we do?` and he said unto them, `Do violence to  no one, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the people are looking forward, and all are reasoning  in their hearts concerning John, whether or not he may be the  Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>John answered, saying to all, `I indeed with water do  baptise you, but he cometh who is mightier than I, of whom I  am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals -- he shall  baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>whose winnowing shovel [is] in his hand, and he will  thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat to his  storehouse, and the chaff he will burn with fire  unquenchable.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, therefore, indeed with many other things, exhorting,  he was proclaiming good news to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning  Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, and concerning all  the evils that Herod did,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>added also this to all, that he shut up John in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, in all the people being baptised,  Jesus also being baptised, and praying, the heaven was opened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily appearance, as if  a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, saying,  `Thou art My Son -- the Beloved, in thee I did delight.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years of  age, being, as was supposed, son of Joseph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the [son] of Eli, the [son] of Matthat, the [son] of Levi,  the [son] of Melchi, the [son] of Janna, the [son] of Joseph,</span>
