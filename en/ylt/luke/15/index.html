make me as  one of thy hirelings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>`And having risen, he went unto his own father, and he  being yet far distant, his father saw him, and was moved with  compassion, and having ran he fell upon his neck and kissed  him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the son said to him, Father, I did sin -- to the  heaven, and before thee, and no more am I worthy to be called  thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And the father said unto his servants, Bring forth the  first robe, and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand, and  sandals for the feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and having brought the fatted calf, kill [it], and having  eaten, we may be merry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because this my son was dead, and did live again, and he  was lost, and was found; and they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`And his elder son was in a field, and as, coming, he drew  nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and having called near one of the young men, he was  inquiring what these things might be,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he said to him -- Thy brother is arrived, and thy  father did kill the fatted calf, because in health he did  receive him back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`And he was angry, and would not go in, therefore his  father, having come forth, was entreating him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and he answering said to the father, Lo, so many years I  do serve thee, and never thy command did I transgress, and to  me thou didst never give a kid, that with my friends I might  make merry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but when thy son -- this one who did devour thy living  with harlots -- came, thou didst kill to him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and  all my things are thine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but to be merry, and to be glad, it was needful, because  this thy brother was dead, and did live again, he was lost,  and was found.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
