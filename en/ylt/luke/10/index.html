beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest,  that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>`Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of  wolves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on  the way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to  this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on  it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn  back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things  they have, for worthy [is] the workman of his hire; go not from  house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you,  eat the things set before you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of  God hath come nigh to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`And into whatever city ye do enter, and they may not  receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we  do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of  God hath come nigh to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be  more tolerable than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in  Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done  in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had  reformed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the  judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted,  unto hades thou shalt be brought down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is  putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me  away, doth put away Him who sent me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, `Sir, and  the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he said to them, `I was beholding the Adversary, as  lightning from the heaven having fallen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and  scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by  any means shall hurt you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected  to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the  heavens.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour was Jesus glad in the Spirit, and said, `I do  confess to thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth,  that Thou didst hide these things from wise men and  understanding, and didst reveal them to babes; yes, Father,  because so it became good pleasure before Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`All things were delivered up to me by my Father, and no  one doth know who the Son is, except the Father, and who the  Father is, except the Son, and he to whom the Son may wish to  reveal [Him].`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having turned unto the disciples, he said, by  themselves, `Happy the eyes that are perceiving what ye  perceive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for I say to you, that many prophets and kings did wish to  see what ye perceive, and did not see, and to hear what ye  hear, and did not hear.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And lo, a certain lawyer stood up, trying him, and saying,  `Teacher, what having done, life age-during shall I inherit?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said unto him, `In the law what hath been written?  how dost thou read?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he answering said, `Thou shalt love the Lord thy God  out of all thy heart, and out of all thy soul, and out of all  thy strength, and out of all thy understanding, and thy  neighbour as thyself.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to him, `Rightly thou didst answer; this do,  and thou shalt live.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he, willing to declare himself righteous, said unto  Jesus, `And who is my neighbour?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and Jesus having taken up [the word], said, `A certain man  was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among  robbers, and having stripped him and inflicted blows, they went  away, leaving [him] half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And by a coincidence a certain priest was going down in  that way, and having seen him, he passed over on the opposite  side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and in like manner also, a Levite, having been about the  place, having come and seen, passed over on the opposite side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>`But a certain Samaritan, journeying, came along him, and  having seen him, he was moved with compassion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and having come near, he bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine, and having lifted him up on his own beast, he  brought him to an inn, and was careful of him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and on the morrow, going forth, taking out two denaries,  he gave to the innkeeper, and said to him, Be careful of him,  and whatever thou mayest spend more, I, in my coming again,  will give back to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>`Who, then, of these three, seemeth to thee to have become  neighbour of him who fell among the robbers?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and he said, `He who did the kindness with him,` then  Jesus said to him, `Be going on, and thou be doing in like  manner.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it came to pass, in their going on, that he entered  into a certain village, and a certain woman, by name Martha,  did receive him into her house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and she had also a sister, called Mary, who also, having  seated herself beside the feet of Jesus, was hearing the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and Martha was distracted about much serving, and having  stood by him, she said, `Sir, dost thou not care that my sister  left me alone to serve? say then to her, that she may partake  along with me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus answering said to her, `Martha, Martha, thou art  anxious and disquieted about many things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but of one thing there is need, and Mary the good part did  choose, that shall not be taken away from her.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
