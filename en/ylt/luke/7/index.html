a reed by the wind shaken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but what have ye gone forth to see? a man in soft garments  clothed? lo, they in splendid apparellings, and living in  luxury, are in the houses of kings!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`But what have ye gone forth to see? a prophet? Yes, I say  to you, and much more than a prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>this is he concerning whom it hath been written, Lo, I send  my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before  thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I say to you, a greater prophet, among those born of  women, than John the Baptist there is not; but the least in  the reign of God is greater than he.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And all the people having heard, and the tax-gatherers,  declared God righteous, having been baptized with the baptism  of John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but the Pharisees, and the lawyers, the counsel of God did  put away for themselves, not having been baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, `To what, then, shall I liken the men of  this generation? and to what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>they are like to children, to those sitting in a  market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We piped  to you, and ye did not dance, we mourned to you, and ye did not  weep!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>`For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor  drinking wine, and ye say, He hath a demon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and ye say, Lo, a  man, a glutton, and a wine drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers  and sinners;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and the wisdom was justified from all her children.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And a certain one of the Pharisees was asking him that he  might eat with him, and having gone into the house of the  Pharisee he reclined (at meat),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and lo, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having known  that he reclineth (at meat) in the house of the Pharisee,  having provided an alabaster box of ointment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and having stood behind, beside his feet, weeping, she  began to wet his feet with the tears, and with the hairs of  her head she was wiping, and was kissing his feet, and was  anointing with the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the Pharisee who did call him, having seen, spake  within himself, saying, `This one, if he were a prophet, would  have known who and of what kind [is] the woman who doth touch  him, that she is a sinner.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answering said unto him, `Simon, I have something  to say to thee;` and he saith, `Teacher, say on.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>`Two debtors were to a certain creditor; the one was owing  five hundred denaries, and the other fifty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they not having [wherewith] to give back, he forgave  both; which then of them, say thou, will love him more?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Simon answering said, `I suppose that to whom he  forgave the more;` and he said to him, `Rightly thou didst  judge.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And having turned unto the woman, he said to Simon, `Seest  thou this woman? I entered into thy house; water for my feet  thou didst not give, but this woman with tears did wet my  feet, and with the hairs of her head did wipe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>a kiss to me thou didst not give, but this woman, from what  [time] I came in, did not cease kissing my feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>with oil my head thou didst not anoint, but this woman with  ointment did anoint my feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>therefore I say to thee, her many sins have been forgiven,  because she did love much; but to whom little is forgiven,  little he doth love.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, `Thy sins have been forgiven;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and those reclining with him (at meat) began to say within  themselves, `Who is this, who also doth forgive sins?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and he said unto the woman, `Thy faith have saved thee, be  going on to peace.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
