no one  [is] good, except One -- God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit  adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal, Thou  mayest not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy  mother.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, `All these I did keep from my youth;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and having heard these things, Jesus said to him, `Yet one  thing to thee is lacking; all things -- as many as thou hast --  sell, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure  in heaven, and come, be following me;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he, having heard these things, became very sorrowful,  for he was exceeding rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful, said,  `How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of  God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle  to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And those who heard, said, `And who is able to be saved?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he said, `The things impossible with men are possible  with God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter said, `Lo, we left all, and did follow thee;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and he said to them, `Verily I say to you, that there is  not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or  children, for the sake of the reign of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who may not receive back manifold more in this time, and  in the coming age, life age-during.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And having taken the twelve aside, he said unto them, `Lo,  we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be completed --  that have been written through the prophets -- to the Son of  Man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be  mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and having scourged they shall put him to death, and on  the third day he shall rise again.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they none of these things understood, and this saying  was hid from them, and they were not knowing the things said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, in his coming nigh to Jericho, a  certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and having heard a multitude going by, he was inquiring  what this may be,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth  pass by,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and he cried out, saying, `Jesus, Son of David, deal  kindly with me;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and those going before were rebuking him, that he might be  silent, but he was much more crying out, `Son of David, deal  kindly with me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought unto  him, and he having come nigh, he questioned him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>saying, `What wilt thou I shall do to thee?` and he said,  `Sir, that I may receive sight.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, `Receive thy sight; thy faith hath  saved thee;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and presently he did receive sight, and was following him,  glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did give  praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
