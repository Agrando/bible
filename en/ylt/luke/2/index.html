days, there went forth a decree  from Caesar Augustus, that all the world be enrolled --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>this enrollment first came to pass when Cyrenius was  governor of Syria --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and all were going to be enrolled, each to his proper city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of  Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, that is called  Bethlehem, because of his being of the house and family of  David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>to enroll himself with Mary his betrothed wife, being with  child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, in their being there, the days were  fulfilled for her bringing forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and wrapped  him up, and laid him down in the manger, because there was not  for them a place in the guest-chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were shepherds in the same region, lodging in the  field, and keeping the night-watches over their flock,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood over them, and the  glory of the Lord shone around them, and they feared a great  fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the messenger said to them, `Fear not, for lo, I bring  you good news of great joy, that shall be to all the people --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because there was born to you to-day a Saviour -- who is  Christ the Lord -- in the city of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and this [is] to you the sign: Ye shall find a babe wrapped  up, lying in the manger.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And suddenly there came with the messenger a multitude of  the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`Glory in the highest to God, and upon earth peace, among  men -- good will.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when the messengers were gone away  from them to the heavens, that the men, the shepherds, said  unto one another, `We may go over indeed unto Bethlehem, and  see this thing that hath come to pass, that the Lord did make  known to us.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came, having hasted, and found both Mary, and  Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and having seen, they made known abroad concerning the  saying spoken to them concerning the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all who heard, did wonder concerning the things spoken  by the shepherds unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Mary was preserving all these things, pondering in her  heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the shepherds turned back, glorifying and praising God,  for all those things they heard and saw, as it was spoken unto  them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child,  then was his name called Jesus, having been so called by the  messenger before his being conceived in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the days of their purification were fulfilled,  according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to  Jerusalem, to present to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>as it hath been written in the Law of the Lord, -- `Every  male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord,`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to give a sacrifice, according to that said in the Law  of the Lord, `A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And lo, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name [is]  Simeon, and this man is righteous and devout, looking for the  comforting of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and it hath been divinely told him by the Holy Spirit --  not to see death before he may see the Christ of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came in the Spirit to the temple, and in the parents  bringing in the child Jesus, for their doing according to the  custom of the law regarding him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`Now Thou dost send away Thy servant, Lord, according to  Thy word, in peace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because mine eyes did see Thy salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which Thou didst prepare before the face of all the  peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a light to the uncovering of nations, and the glory of Thy  people Israel.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things  spoken concerning him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother,  `Lo, this [one] is set for the falling and rising again of many  in Israel, and for a sign spoken against --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(and also thine own soul shall a sword pass through) --  that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of  the tribe of Asher, she was much advanced in days, having  lived with an husband seven years from her virginity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and she [is] a widow of about eighty-four years, who did  depart not from the temple, with fasts and supplications  serving, night and day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and she, at that hour, having come in, was confessing,  likewise, to the Lord, and was speaking concerning him, to all  those looking for redemption in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they finished all things, according to the Law of  the Lord, they turned back to Galilee, to their city Nazareth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, being  filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And his parents were going yearly to Jerusalem, at the  feast of the passover,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and when he became twelve years old, they having gone up to  Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and having finished the days, in their returning the child  Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother  did not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and, having supposed him to be in the company, they went a  day`s journey, and were seeking him among the kindred and  among the acquaintances,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and not having found him, they turned back to Jerusalem  seeking him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And it came to pass, after three days, they found him in  the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing  them and questioning them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and all those hearing him were astonished at his  understanding and answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And, having seen him, they were amazed, and his mother said  unto him, `Child, why didst thou thus to us? lo, thy father  and I, sorrowing, were seeking thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he said unto them, `Why [is it] that ye were seeking  me? did ye not know that in the things of my Father it  behoveth me to be?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and they did not understand the saying that he spake to  them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and he  was subject to them, and his mother was keeping all these  sayings in her heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and Jesus was advancing in wisdom, and in stature, and in  favour with God and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
