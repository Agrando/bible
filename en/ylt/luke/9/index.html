And he said unto his  disciples, `Cause them to recline in companies, in each fifty;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and they did so, and made all to recline;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and having taken the five loaves, and the two fishes,  having looked up to the heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and  was giving to the disciples to set before the multitude;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they did eat, and were all filled, and there was taken  up what was over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, as he is praying alone, the disciples  were with him, and he questioned them, saying, `Who do the  multitudes say me to be?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they answering said, `John the Baptist; and others,  Elijah; and others, that a prophet, one of the ancients, was  risen;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he said to them, `And ye -- who do ye say me to be?`  and Peter answering said, `The Christ of God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having charged them, he commanded [them] to say this to  no one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>saying -- `It behoveth the Son of Man to suffer many  things, and to be rejected by the elders, and chief priests,  and scribes, and to be killed, and the third day to be raised.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto all, `If any one doth will to come after  me, let him disown himself, and take up his cross daily, and  follow me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for whoever may will to save his life, shall lose it, and  whoever may lose his life for my sake, he shall save it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for what is a man profited, having gained the whole world,  and having lost or having forfeited himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`For whoever may be ashamed of me, and of my words, of this  one shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he may come in his  glory, and the Father`s, and the holy messengers`;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and I say to you, truly, there are certain of those here  standing, who shall not taste of death till they may see the  reign of God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, after these words, as it were eight  days, that having taken Peter, and John, and James, he went up  to the mountain to pray,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and it came to pass, in his praying, the appearance of his  face became altered, and his garment white -- sparkling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And lo, two men were speaking together with him, who were  Moses and Elijah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>who having appeared in glory, spake of his outgoing that he  was about to fulfil in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep, and  having waked, they saw his glory, and the two men standing  with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to pass, in their parting from him, Peter said  unto Jesus, `Master, it is good to us to be here; and we may  make three booths, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one  for Elijah,` not knowing what he saith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and as he was speaking these things, there came a cloud,  and overshadowed them, and they feared in their entering into  the cloud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and a voice came out of the cloud saying, `This is My Son  -- the Beloved; hear ye him;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone; and  they were silent, and declared to no one in those days  anything of what they have seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass on the next day, they having come down  from the mount, there met him a great multitude,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and lo, a man from the multitude cried out, saying,  `Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son, because he is my  only begotten;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and lo, a spirit doth take him, and suddenly he doth cry  out, and it teareth him, with foaming, and it hardly departeth  from him, bruising him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and I besought thy disciples that they might cast it out,  and they were not able.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus answering said, `O generation, unstedfast and  perverse, till when shall I be with you, and suffer you? bring  near hither thy son;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and as he is yet coming near, the demon rent him, and tore  [him] sore, and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed  the youth, and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were all amazed at the greatness of God, and while  all are wondering at all things that Jesus did, he said unto  his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>`Lay ye to your ears these words, for the Son of Man is  about to be delivered up to the hands of men.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they were not knowing this saying, and it was veiled  from them, that they might not perceive it, and they were  afraid to ask him about this saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And there entered a reasoning among them, this, Who may be  greater of them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and Jesus having seen the reasoning of their heart, having  taken hold of a child, set him beside himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and said to them, `Whoever may receive this child in my  name, doth receive me, and whoever may receive me, doth receive  Him who sent me, for he who is least among you all -- he shall  be great.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And John answering said, `Master, we saw a certain one in  thy name casting forth the demons, and we forbade him, because  he doth not follow with us;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and Jesus said unto him, `Forbid not, for he who is not  against us, is for us.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, in the completing of the days of his  being taken up, that he fixed his face to go on to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and he sent messengers before his face, and having gone on,  they went into a village of Samaritans, to make ready for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and they did not receive him, because his face was going on  to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And his disciples James and John having seen, said, `Sir,  wilt thou [that] we may command fire to come down from the  heaven, and to consume them, as also Elijah did?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and having turned, he rebuked them, and said, `Ye have not  known of what spirit ye are;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men`s lives, but  to save;` and they went on to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And it came to pass, as they are going on in the way, a  certain one said unto him, `I will follow thee wherever thou  mayest go, sir;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and Jesus said to him, `The foxes have holes, and the fowls  of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not  where he may recline the head.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And he said unto another, `Be following me;` and he said,  `Sir, permit me, having gone away, first to bury my father;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and Jesus said to him, `Suffer the dead to bury their own  dead, and thou, having gone away, publish the reign of God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And another also said, `I will follow thee, sir, but first  permit me to take leave of those in my house;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>and Jesus said unto him, `No one having put his hand on a  plough, and looking back, is fit for the reign of God.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
