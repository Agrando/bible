according to the law of Moses the man of God the  priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the  Levites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for many [are] in the assembly who have not sanctified  themselves, and the Levites [are] over the slaughtering of the  passover-offerings for every one not clean, to sanctify [him]  to Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and  Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, have not been cleansed, but  have eaten the passover otherwise than it is written; but  Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, `Jehovah, who [is] good, doth  receive atonement for every one</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who hath prepared his heart to seek God -- Jehovah, God of  his fathers -- yet not according to the cleansing of the  sanctuary;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Jehovah hearkeneth unto Hezekiah, and healeth the  people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, make the  feast of unleavened things seven days with great joy; and  giving praise to Jehovah day by day are the Levites and the  priests, with instruments of praise before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah speaketh unto the heart of all the Levites,  those giving good understanding concerning Jehovah, and they  eat the appointed thing seven days; sacrificing sacrifices of  peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, God of their  fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the assembly take counsel to keep other seven  days, and they keep seven days [with] joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for Hezekiah king of Judah hath presented to the assembly  a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep; and the heads  have presented to the assembly bullocks a thousand, and sheep  ten thousand; and priests sanctify themselves in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the assembly of Judah rejoice, and the priests,  and the Levites, and all the assembly, those coming in from  Israel, and the sojourners, those coming in from the land of  Israel, and those dwelling in Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and there is great joy in Jerusalem; for from the days of  Solomon son of David king of Israel there is not like this in  Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the priests, the Levites, rise and bless the people,  and their voice is heard, and their prayer cometh in to His  holy habitation, to the heavens.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
