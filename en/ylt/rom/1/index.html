Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Because of this did God give them up to dishonourable  affections, for even their females did change the natural use  into that against nature;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and in like manner also the males having left the natural  use of the female, did burn in their longing toward one  another; males with males working shame, and the recompense of  their error that was fit, in themselves receiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, according as they did not approve of having God in  knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the  things not seemly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>having been filled with all unrighteousness, whoredom,  wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife,  deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>evil-speakers, God-haters, insulting, proud, boasters,  inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>unintelligent, faithless, without natural affection,  implacable, unmerciful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who the righteous judgment of God having known -- that  those practising such things are worthy of death -- not only do  them, but also have delight with those practising them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
