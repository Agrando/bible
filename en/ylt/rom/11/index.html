What Israel doth seek after, this it did not  obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>according as it hath been written, `God gave to them a  spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,`  -- unto this very day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and David saith, `Let their table become for a snare, and  for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to  them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>let their eyes be darkened -- not to behold, and their  back do Thou always bow down.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say, then, Did they stumble that they might fall? let it  not be! but by their fall the salvation [is] to the nations,  to arouse them to jealousy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and if the fall of them [is] the riches of a world, and  the diminution of them the riches of nations, how much more  the fulness of them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For to you I speak -- to the nations -- inasmuch as I am  indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh,  and shall save some of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for if the casting away of them [is] a reconciliation of  the world, what the reception -- if not life out of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and if the first-fruit [is] holy, the lump also; and if  the root [is] holy, the branches also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if certain of the branches were broken off, and thou,  being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a  fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive  tree didst become --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not boast against the branches; and if thou dost boast,  thou dost not bear the root, but the root thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say, then, `The branches were broken off, that I  might be graffed in;` right!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by unbelief they were broken off, and thou hast stood by  faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for if God the natural branches did not spare -- lest  perhaps He also shall not spare thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Lo, then, goodness and severity of God -- upon those  indeed who fell, severity; and upon thee, goodness, if thou  mayest remain in the goodness, otherwise, thou also shalt be  cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall  be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for if thou, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast  cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good  olive tree, how much rather shall they, who [are] according to  nature, be graffed into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this  secret -- that ye may not be wise in your own conceits -- that  hardness in part to Israel hath happened till the fulness of  the nations may come in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it hath  been written, `There shall come forth out of Sion he who is  delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and this to them [is] the covenant from Me, when I may  take away their sins.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As regards, indeed, the good tidings, [they are] enemies  on your account; and as regards the choice -- beloved on  account of the fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for unrepented of [are] the gifts and the calling of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for as ye also once did not believe in God, and now did  find kindness by the unbelief of these:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness  they also may find kindness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that  to the whole He might do kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O depth of riches, and wisdom and knowledge of God! how  unsearchable His judgments, and untraceable His ways!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>for who did know the mind of the Lord? or who did become  His counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>or who did first give to Him, and it shall be given back  to him again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>because of Him, and through Him, and to Him [are] the all  things; to Him [is] the glory -- to the ages.
