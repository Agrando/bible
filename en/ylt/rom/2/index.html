-- not knowing that the  goodness of God doth lead thee to reformation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou  dost treasure up to thyself wrath, in a day of wrath and of  the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who shall render to each according to his works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to those, indeed, who in continuance of a good work, do seek  glory, and honour, and incorruptibility -- life age-during;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and to those contentious, and disobedient, indeed, to the  truth, and obeying the unrighteousness -- indignation and  wrath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>tribulation and distress, upon every soul of man that is  working the evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and glory, and honour, and peace, to every one who is  working the good, both to Jew first, and to Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For there is no acceptance of faces with God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for as many as without law did sin, without law also shall  perish, and as many as did sin in law, through law shall be  judged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for not the hearers of the law [are] righteous before God,  but the doers of the law shall be declared righteous: --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, when nations that have not a law, by nature may do the  things of the law, these not having a law -- to themselves are  a law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who do shew the work of the law written in their hearts,  their conscience also witnessing with them, and between one  another the thoughts accusing or else defending,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men,  according to my good news, through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Lo, thou art named a Jew, and dost rest upon the law, and  dost boast in God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and dost know the will, and dost approve the distinctions,  being instructed out of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of blind  ones, a light of those in darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>an instructor of foolish ones, a teacher of babes, having  the form of the knowledge and of the truth in the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou, then, who art teaching another, thyself dost thou not  teach?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>thou who art preaching not to steal, dost thou steal? thou  who art saying not to commit adultery, dost thou commit  adultery? thou who art abhorring the idols, dost thou rob  temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>thou who in the law dost boast, through the transgression  of the law God dost thou dishonour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for the name of God because of you is evil spoken of among  the nations, according as it hath been written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For circumcision, indeed, doth profit, if law thou mayest  practise, but if a transgressor of law thou mayest be, thy  circumcision hath become uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If, therefore the uncircumcision the righteousness of the  law may keep, shall not his uncircumcision for circumcision be  reckoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the uncircumcision, by nature, fulfilling the law,  shall judge thee who, through letter and circumcision, [art] a  transgressor of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he is not a Jew who is [so] outwardly, neither [is]  circumcision that which is outward in flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but a Jew [is] he who is [so] inwardly, and circumcision  [is] of the heart, in spirit, not in letter, of which the  praise is not of men, but of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
