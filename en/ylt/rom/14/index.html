He who is eating, to the Lord he doth eat,  for he doth give thanks to God; and he who is not eating, to  the Lord he doth not eat, and doth give thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us to himself doth live, and none to himself  doth die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we  may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if  we may die, we are the Lord`s;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for because of this Christ both died and rose again, and  lived again, that both of dead and of living he may be Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or again, thou,  why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand  at the tribunal of the Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for it hath been written, `I live! saith the Lord -- to Me  bow shall every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so, then, each of us concerning himself shall give  reckoning to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>no longer, therefore, may we judge one another, but this  judge ye rather, not to put a stumbling-stone before the  brother, or an offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that  nothing [is] unclean of itself, except to him who is reckoning  anything to be unclean -- to that one [it is] unclean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if through victuals thy brother is grieved, no more  dost thou walk according to love; do not with thy victuals  destroy that one for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the reign of God is not eating and drinking, but  righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for he who in these things is serving the Christ, [is]  acceptable to God and approved of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So, then, the things of peace may we pursue, and the  things of building up one another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God;  all things, indeed, [are] pure, but evil [is] to the man who  is eating through stumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Right [it is] not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to  [do anything] in which thy brother doth stumble, or is made to  fall, or is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou hast faith! to thyself have [it] before God; happy is  he who is not judging himself in what he doth approve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he who is making a difference, if he may eat, hath  been condemned, because [it is] not of faith; and all that  [is] not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
