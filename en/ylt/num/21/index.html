pray unto  Jehovah, and He doth turn aside from us the serpent;` and Moses  prayeth in behalf of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Make for thee a burning  [serpent], and set it on an ensign; and it hath been, every one  who is bitten and hath seen it -- he hath lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses maketh a serpent of brass, and setteth it on the  ensign, and it hath been, if the serpent hath bitten any man,  and he hath looked expectingly unto the serpent of brass -- he  hath lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of Israel journey, and encamp in Oboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they journey from Oboth, and encamp in Ije-Abarim, in  the wilderness that [is] on the front of Moab, at the rising of  the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From thence they have journeyed, and encamp in the valley  of Zared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From thence they have journeyed, and encamp beyond Arnon,  which [is] in the wilderness which is coming out of the border  of the Amorite, for Arnon [is] the border of Moab, between Moab  and the Amorite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore it is said in a book, `The wars of Jehovah,` --  `Waheb in Suphah, And the brooks of Arnon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the spring of the brooks, Which turned aside to the  dwelling of Ar, And hath leaned to the border of Moab.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from thence [they journeyed] to Beer; it [is] the well  [concerning] which Jehovah said to Moses, `Gather the people,  and I give to them -- water.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then singeth Israel this song, concerning the well -- they  have answered to it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`A well -- digged it have princes, Prepared it have nobles  of the people, With the lawgiver, with their staves.` And from  the wilderness [they journeyed] to Mattanah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to  Bamoth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and from Bamoth in the valley which [is] in the field of  Moab [to] the top of Pisgah, which hath looked on the front of  the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel sendeth messengers unto Sihon king of the  Amorite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`Let me pass through thy land, we do not turn aside into a  field, or into a vineyard, we do not drink waters of a well; in  the king`s way we go, till that we pass over thy border.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Sihon hath not suffered Israel to pass through his  border, and Sihon gathereth all his people, and cometh out to  meet Israel into the wilderness, and cometh in to Jahaz, and  fighteth against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Israel smiteth him by the mouth of the sword, and  possesseth his land from Arnon unto Jabbok -- unto the sons of  Ammon;
