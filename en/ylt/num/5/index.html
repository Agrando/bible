unto the outside of  the camp ye do send them; and they defile not their camps in  the midst of which I do tabernacle.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sons of Israel do so, and they send them out unto  the outside of the camp; as Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses so  have the sons of Israel done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`Speak unto the sons of Israel, Man or woman, when they do  any of the sins of man, by committing a trespass against  Jehovah, and that person [is] guilty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and they have confessed their sin which they have done, then  he hath restored his guilt in its principal, and its fifth is  adding to it, and hath given [it] to him in reference to whom  he hath been guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`And if the man have no redeemer to restore the guilt to,  the guilt which is restored [is] Jehovah`s, the priest`s, apart  from the ram of the atonements, whereby he maketh atonement for  him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the sons  of Israel, which they bring near to the priest, becometh his;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and any man`s hallowed things become his; that which any  man giveth to the priest becometh his.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto  them, When any man`s wife turneth aside, and hath committed  against him a trespass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and a man hath lain with her [with] the seed of copulation,  and it hath been hid from the eyes of her husband, and  concealed, and she hath been defiled, and there is no witness  against her, and she hath not been caught,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and a spirit of jealousy hath passed over him, and he hath  been jealous of his wife, and she hath been defiled; -- or, a  spirit of jealousy hath passed over him, and he hath been  jealous of his wife, and she hath not been defiled --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`Then hath the man brought in his wife unto the priest, and  he hath brought in her offering for her, a tenth of the ephah  of barley meal, he doth not pour on it oil, nor doth he put on  it frankincense, for it [is] a present of jealousy, a present  of memorial, causing remembrance of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And the priest hath brought her near, and hath caused her  to stand before Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the priest hath taken holy water in an earthen vessel,  and of the dust which is on the floor of the tabernacle doth  the priest take, and hath put [it] into the water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the priest hath caused the woman to stand before  Jehovah, and hath uncovered the woman`s head, and hath given  into her hands the present of the memorial, it [is] a present  of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest are the bitter  waters which cause the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`And the priest hath caused her to swear, and hath said  unto the woman, If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast  not turned aside [to] uncleanness under thy husband, be free  from these bitter waters which cause the curse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and thou, if thou hast turned aside under thy husband, and  if thou hast been defiled, and any man doth give his copulation  to thee besides thy husband --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(then the priest hath caused the woman to swear with an  oath of execration, and the priest hath said to the woman) --  Jehovah doth give thee for an execration, and for a curse, in  the midst of thy people, in Jehovah`s giving thy thigh to fall,  and thy belly to swell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and these waters which cause the curse have gone into thy  bowels, to cause the belly to swell, and the thigh to fall; and  the woman hath said, Amen, Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`And the priest hath written these execrations in a book,  and hath blotted [them] out with the bitter waters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and hath caused the woman to drink the bitter waters which  cause the curse, and the waters which cause the curse have  entered into her for bitter things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`And the priest hath taken out of the hand of the woman the  present of jealousy, and hath waved the present before Jehovah,  and hath brought it near unto the altar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the priest hath taken a handful of the present, its  memorial, and hath made perfume on the altar, and afterwards  doth cause the woman to drink the water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>yea, he hath caused her to drink the water, and it hath  come to pass, if she hath been defiled, and doth commit a  trespass against her husband, that the waters which cause the  curse have gone into her for bitter things, and her belly hath  swelled, and her thigh hath fallen, and the woman hath become  an execration in the midst of her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`And if the woman hath not been defiled, and is clean, then  she hath been acquitted, and hath been sown [with] seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`This [is] the law of jealousies, when a wife turneth aside  under her husband, and hath been defiled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>or when a spirit of jealousy passeth over a man, and he  hath been jealous of his wife, then he hath caused the woman to  stand before Jehovah, and the priest hath done to her all this  law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the man hath been acquitted from iniquity, and that  woman doth bear her iniquity.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
