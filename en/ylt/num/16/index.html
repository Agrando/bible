and wherefore  do ye lift yourselves up above the assembly of Jehovah?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses heareth, and falleth on his face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and he speaketh unto Korah, and unto all his company,  saying, `Morning! -- and Jehovah is knowing those who are his,  and him who is holy, and hath brought near unto Him; even him  whom He doth fix on He bringeth near unto Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This do: take to yourselves censers, Korah, and all his  company,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and put in them fire, and put on them perfume, before  Jehovah to-morrow, and it hath been, the man whom Jehovah  chooseth, he [is] the holy one; -- enough of you, sons of  Levi.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses saith unto Korah, `Hear ye, I pray you, sons of  Levi;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>is it little to you that the God of Israel hath separated  you from the company of Israel to bring you near unto Himself,  to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand  before the company to serve them? --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>yea, He doth bring thee near, and all thy brethren the  sons of Levi with thee -- and ye have sought also the  priesthood!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, thou and all thy company who are met [are]  against Jehovah; and Aaron, what [is] he, that ye murmur  against him?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses sendeth to call for Dathan and for Abiram sons  of Eliab, and they say, `We do not come up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>is it little that thou hast brought us up out of a land  flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in a wilderness  that thou also certainly makest thyself prince over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yea, unto a land flowing with milk and honey thou hast not  brought us in, nor dost thou give to us an inheritance of field  and vineyard; the eyes of these men dost thou pick out? we do  not come up.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it is very displeasing to Moses, and he saith unto  Jehovah, `Turn not Thou unto their present; not one ass from  them have I taken, nor have I afflicted one of them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses saith unto Korah, `Thou and all thy company, be  ye before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and take ye each his censer, and ye have put on them  perfume, and brought near before Jehovah, each his censer, two  hundred and fifty censers; and thou and Aaron, each his  censer.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they take each his censer, and put on them fire, and  lay on them perfume, and they stand at the opening of the tent  of meeting, with Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Korah assembleth against them all the company unto the  opening of the tent of meeting, and the honour of Jehovah is  seen by all the company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`Be ye separated from the midst of this company, and I  consume them in a moment;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and they fall on their faces, and say, `God, God of the  spirits of all flesh -- the one man sinneth, and against all  the company Thou art wroth!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`Speak unto the company, saying, Go ye up from round about  the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses riseth, and goeth unto Dathan and Abiram, and  the elders of Israel go after him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and he speaketh unto the company, saying, `Turn aside, I  pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and come not  against anything that they have, lest ye be consumed in all  their sins.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they go up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and  Abiram, from round about, and Dathan, and Abiram have come out,  standing at the opening of their tents, and their wives, and  their sons, and their infants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses saith, `By this ye do know that Jehovah hath  sent me to do all these works, that [they are] not from my own  heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>if according to the death of all men these die -- or the  charge of all men is charged upon them -- Jehovah hath not sent  me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and if a strange thing Jehovah do, and the ground hath  opened her mouth and swallowed them, and all that they have,  and they have gone down alive to Sheol -- then ye have known  that these men have despised Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it cometh to pass at his finishing speaking all these  words, that the ground which [is] under them cleaveth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the earth openeth her mouth, and swalloweth them, and  their houses, and all the men who [are] for Korah, and all the  goods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and they go down, they, and all that they have, alive to  Sheol, and the earth closeth over them, and they perish from  the midst of the assembly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and all Israel who [are] round about them have fled at  their voice, for they said, `Lest the earth swallow us;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and fire hath come out from Jehovah, and consumeth the two  hundred and fifty men bringing near the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>`Say unto Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, and he lifteth  up the censers from the midst of the burning, and the fire  scatter thou yonder, for they have been hallowed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>[even] the censers of these sinners against their own  souls; and they have made them spread-out plates, a covering for  the altar, for they have brought them near before Jehovah, and  they are hallowed; and they are become a sign to the sons of  Israel.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Eleazar the priest taketh the brazen censers which  they who are burnt had brought near, and they spread them out,  a covering for the altar --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>a memorial to the sons of Israel, so that a stranger who  is not of the seed of Aaron doth not draw near to make a  perfume before Jehovah, and is not as Korah, and as his  company, -- as Jehovah hath spoken by the hand of Moses to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur, on the  morrow, against Moses and against Aaron, saying, `Ye -- ye have  put to death the people of Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it cometh to pass, in the company being assembled  against Moses and against Aaron, that they turn towards the  tent of meeting, and lo, the cloud hath covered it, and the  honour of Jehovah is seen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and Moses cometh -- Aaron also -- unto the front of the  tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>`Get you up from the midst of this company, and I consume  them in a moment;` and they fall on their faces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and Moses saith unto Aaron, `Take the censer, and put on  it fire from off the altar, and place perfume, and go, hasten  unto the company, and make atonement for them, for the wrath  hath gone out from the presence of Jehovah -- the plague hath  begun.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Aaron taketh as Moses hath spoken, and runneth unto  the midst of the assembly, and lo, the plague hath begun among  the people; and he giveth the perfume, and maketh atonement for  the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and standeth between the dead and the living, and the  plague is restrained;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and those who die by the plague are fourteen thousand and  seven hundred, apart from those who die for the matter of  Korah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and Aaron turneth back unto Moses, unto the opening of the  tent of meeting, and the plague hath been restrained.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
