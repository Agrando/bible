Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>`Execute the vengeance of the sons of Israel against the  Midianites -- afterwards thou art gathered unto thy people.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses speaketh unto the people, saying, `Be ye armed  some of you for the host, and they are against Midian, to put  the vengeance of Jehovah on Midian;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>a thousand for a tribe -- a thousand for a tribe, to all  the tribes of Israel -- ye do send to the host.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there are given out of the thousands of Israel a  thousand for a tribe, twelve thousand armed ones of the host;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and Moses sendeth them, a thousand for a tribe, to the  host, them and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, to the host;  and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of the shouting, in his  hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they war against Midian, as Jehovah hath commanded  Moses, and slay every male;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the kings of Midian they have slain, besides their  pierced ones, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five  kings of Midian; and Balaam son of Beor, they have slain with  the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Israel take captive the women of Midian,  and their infants; and all their cattle, and all their  substance, and all their wealth they have plundered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and all their cities, with their habitations, and all  their towers, they have burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they take all the spoil, and all the prey, among man  and among beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they bring in, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the  priest, and unto the company of the sons of Israel, the  captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto the camp, unto the  plains of Moab, which [are] by Jordan, [near] Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of  the company, go out to meet them, unto the outside of the camp,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and Moses is wroth against the inspectors of the force,  chiefs of the thousands, and chiefs of the hundreds, who are  coming in from the host of the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses saith unto them, `Have ye kept alive every  female?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lo, they -- they have been to the sons of Israel, through  the word of Balaam, to cause a trespass against Jehovah in the  matter of Peor, and the plague is in the company of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`And now, slay ye every male among the infants, yea, every  woman known of man by the lying of a male ye have slain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and all the infants among the women, who have not known  the lying of a male, ye have kept alive for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`And ye, encamp ye at the outside of the camp seven days  -- any who hath slain a person, and any who hath come against a  pierced one, ye cleanse yourselves on the third day, and on the  seventh day -- ye and your captives;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and every garment, and every skin vessel, and every work  of goats` [hair], and every wooden vessel, ye yourselves  cleanse.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Eleazar the priest saith unto the men of the host who  go in to battle, `This [is] the statute of the law which  Jehovah hath commanded Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>only, the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the  tin, and the lead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>every thing which may go into fire, ye cause to pass over  through fire, and it hath been clean; only, with the water of  separation it is cleansed, and all that may not go into fire,  ye cause to pass over through water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and ye have washed your garments on the seventh day, and  have been clean, and afterwards ye come in unto the camp.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`Take up the sum of the prey of the captives, among man  and among beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of  the fathers of the company;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and thou hast halved the prey between those handling the  battle who go out to the host and all the company;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and thou hast raised a tribute to Jehovah from the men of  war, who go out to the host, one body out of five hundred, of  man, and of the herd, and of the asses, and of the flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>from their half ye do take, and thou hast given to Eleazar  the priest -- the heave-offering of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`And from the sons of Israel`s half thou dost take one  possession out of fifty, of man, of the herd, of the asses, and  of the flock, of all the cattle, and thou hast given them to  the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses doth -- Eleazar the priest also -- as Jehovah  hath commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the prey, the residue of the spoil which the people of  the host have spoiled, is of the flock six hundred thousand,  and seventy thousand, and five thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and of the herd two and seventy thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and of asses one and sixty thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and of human beings -- of the women who have not known the  lying of a male -- all the persons [are] two and thirty  thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the half -- the portion of those who go out into the  host -- the number of the flock is three hundred thousand, and  thirty thousand, and seven thousand and five hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the tribute to Jehovah of the sheep is six hundred  five and seventy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the herd [is] six and thirty thousand, and their  tribute to Jehovah [is] two and seventy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the asses [are] thirty thousand and five hundred, and  their tribute to Jehovah [is] one and sixty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and the human beings [are] sixteen thousand, and their  tribute to Jehovah [is] two and thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Moses giveth the tribute -- Jehovah`s heave-offering  -- to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And of the sons of Israel`s half, which Moses halved from  the men who war --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and the company`s half is, of the flock three hundred  thousand, and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and of the herd six and thirty thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and of asses thirty thousand and five hundred;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and of human beings sixteen thousand --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Moses taketh from the sons of Israel`s half the one  possession from the fifty, of man and of beast, and giveth them  to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah,  as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the inspectors whom the thousands of the host hath,  (heads of the thousands and heads of the hundreds), draw near  unto Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and they say unto Moses, `Thy servants have taken up the  sum of the men of war who [are] with us, and not a man of us  hath been missed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and we bring near Jehovah`s offering, each that which he  hath found, vessels of gold -- chain, and bracelet, seal-ring,  [ear]-ring, and bead -- to make atonement for ourselves before  Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Moses receiveth -- Eleazar the priest also -- the gold  from them, every made vessel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and all the gold of the heave-offering which they have  lifted up to Jehovah is sixteen thousand seven hundred and  fifty shekels, from heads of the thousands, and from heads of  the hundreds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>(the men of the host have spoiled each for himself);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and Moses taketh -- Eleazar the priest also -- the gold  from the heads of the thousands and of the hundreds, and they  bring it in unto the tent of meeting -- a memorial for the sons  of Israel before Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
