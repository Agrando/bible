and Moab is vexed by the presence  of the sons of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and Moab saith unto the elders of Midian, `Now doth the  assembly lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh  up the green thing of the field.` And Balak son of Zippor [is]  king of Moab at that time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and he sendeth messengers unto Balaam son of Beor, to  Pethor, which [is] by the River of the land of the sons of his  people, to call for him, saying, `Lo, a people hath come out of  Egypt; lo, it hath covered the eye of the land, and it is  abiding over-against me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and now, come, I pray thee, curse for me this people, for  it [is] mightier than I; it may be I prevail -- we smite it --  and I cast it out from the land; for I have known -- that which  thou blessest is blessed, and that which thou cursest is  cursed.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian go, and  divinations in their hand, and they come in unto Balaam, and  speak unto him the words of Balak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he saith unto them, `Lodge here to-night, and I have  brought you back word, as Jehovah speaketh unto me;` and the  princes of Moab abide with Balaam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God cometh in unto Balaam, and saith, `Who [are] these  men with thee?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Balaam saith unto God, `Balak, son of Zippor, king of  Moab, hath sent unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Lo, the people that is coming out from Egypt and covereth  the eye of the land, -- now come, pierce it for me; it may be I  am able to fight against it, and have cast it out;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and God saith unto Balaam, `Thou dost not go with them;  thou dost not curse the people; for it [is] blessed.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saith unto the  princes of Balak, `Go unto your land, for Jehovah is refusing  to suffer me to go with you;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the princes of Moab rise, and come in unto Balak, and  say, `Balaam is refusing to come with us.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Balak addeth yet to send princes, more numerous and  honoured than these,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and they come in unto Balaam, and say to him, `Thus said  Balak son of Zippor, Be not, I pray thee, withheld from coming  unto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for very greatly I honour thee, and all that thou sayest  unto me I do; and come, I pray thee, pierce for me this  people.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Balaam answereth and saith unto the servants of Balak,  `If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver  and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Jehovah my  God, to do a little or a great thing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and, now, abide, I pray you, in this [place], you also,  to-night; and I know what Jehovah is adding to speak with me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God cometh in unto Balaam, by night, and saith to him,  `If to call for thee the men have come, rise, go with them, and  only the thing which I speak unto thee -- it thou dost do.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saddleth his ass,  and goeth with the princes of Moab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the anger of God burneth because he is going, and a  messenger of Jehovah stationeth himself in the way for an  adversary to him, and he is riding on his ass, and two of his  servants [are] with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the  way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and the ass turneth aside  out of the way, and goeth into a field, and Balaam smiteth the  ass to turn it aside into the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the messenger of Jehovah standeth in a narrow path of  the vineyards -- a wall on this [side] and a wall on that --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and is pressed  unto the wall, and presseth Balaam`s foot unto the wall, and he  addeth to smite her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the messenger of Jehovah addeth to pass over, and  standeth in a strait place where there is no way to turn aside  -- right or left --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and croucheth  under Balaam, and the anger of Balaam burneth, and he smiteth  the ass with a staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah openeth the mouth of the ass, and she saith to  Balaam, `What have I done to thee that thou hast smitten me  these three times?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and Balaam saith to the ass, `Because thou hast rolled  thyself against me; oh that there were a sword in my hand, for  now I had slain thee;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the ass saith unto Balaam, `Am not I thine ass, upon  which thou hast ridden since [I was] thine unto this day? have  I at all been accustomed to do to thee thus?` and he saith,  `No.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jehovah uncovereth the eyes of Balaam, and he seeeth  the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn  sword in his hand, and he boweth and doth obeisance, to his  face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the messenger of Jehovah saith unto him, `Wherefore  hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? lo, I -- I have  come out for an adversary, for [thy] way hath been perverse  before me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the ass seeth me, and turneth aside at my presence  these three times; unless she had turned aside from my  presence, surely now also, thee I had slain, and her kept  alive.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Balaam saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `I have  sinned, for I did not know that thou [art] standing to meet me  in the way; and now, if evil in thine eyes -- I turn back by  myself.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Balaam, `Go with  the men; and only the word which I speak unto thee -- it thou  dost speak;` and Balaam goeth with the princes of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Balak heareth that Balaam hath come, and goeth out to  meet him, unto a city of Moab, which [is] on the border of  Arnon, which [is] in the extremity of the border;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and Balak saith unto Balaam, `Did I not diligently sent  unto thee to call for thee? why didst thou not come unto me? am  I not truly able to honour thee?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Lo, I have come unto thee;  now -- am I at all able to speak anything? the word which God  setteth in my mouth -- it I do speak.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Balaam goeth with Balak, and they come to  Kirjath-Huzoth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and Balak sacrificeth oxen and sheep, and sendeth to  Balaam, and to the princes who [are] with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and it cometh to pass in the morning, that Balak taketh  Balaam, and causeth him to go up the high places of Baal, and  he seeth from thence the extremity of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
