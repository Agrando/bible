over-against the face of the candlestick  he hath caused its lights to go up, as Jehovah hath commanded  Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And this [is] the work of the candlestick: beaten work of  gold; unto its thigh, unto its flower it [is] beaten work; as  the appearance which Jehovah shewed Moses, so he hath made the  candlestick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`Take the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and  thou hast cleansed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`And thus thou dost to them to cleanse them: sprinkle upon  them waters of atonement, and they have caused a razor to pass  over all their flesh, and have washed their garments, and  cleansed themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and have taken a bullock, a son of the herd, and its  present, flour mixed with oil, -- and a second bullock a son of  the herd thou dost take for a sin-offering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and thou hast brought near the Levites before the tent of  meeting, and thou hast assembled the whole company of the sons  of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and thou hast brought near the Levites before Jehovah, and  the sons of Israel have laid their hands on the Levites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Aaron hath waved the Levites -- a wave-offering before  Jehovah, from the sons of Israel, and they have been -- for  doing the service of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And the Levites lay their hands on the head of the  bullocks, and make thou the one a sin-offering, and the one a  burnt-offering to Jehovah, to atone for the Levites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and thou hast caused the Levites to stand before Aaron, and  before his sons, and hast waved them -- a wave-offering to  Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and thou hast separated the Levites from the midst of the  sons of Israel, and the Levites have become Mine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and afterwards do the Levites come in to serve the tent of  meeting, and thou hast cleansed them, and hast waved them -- a  wave-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`For they are certainly given to Me out of the midst of the  sons of Israel, instead of him who openeth any womb -- the  first-born of all -- from the sons of Israel I have taken them  to Myself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for Mine [is] every first-born among the sons of Israel,  among man and among beast;
