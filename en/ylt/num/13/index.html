whether it  [is] few or many;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and what the land [is] in which it is dwelling, whether it  [is] good or bad; and what [are] the cities in which it is  dwelling, whether in camps or in fortresses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what the land [is], whether it [is] fat or lean;  whether there is wood in it or not; and ye have strengthened  yourselves, and have taken of the fruit of the land;` and the  days [are] days of the first-fruits of grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they go up and spy the land, from the wilderness of  Zin unto Rehob at the going in to Hamath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and they go up by the south, and come in unto Hebron, and  there [are] Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, children of Anak (and  Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they come in unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down  thence a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they bear it on  a staff by two, also [some] of the pomegranates, and of the  figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That place hath [one] called Brook of Eshcol, because of  the cluster which the sons of Israel cut from thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they turn back from spying the land at the end of  forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they go and come in unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and  unto all the company of the sons of Israel, unto the wilderness  of Paran, to Kadesh;
