and thou, and thy sons with thee, do bear the  iniquity of your priesthood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy  father, bring near with thee, and they are joined unto thee,  and serve thee, even thou and thy sons with thee, before the  tent of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>`And they have kept thy charge, and the charge of all the  tent; only, unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the  altar they do not come near, and they die not, either they or  you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and they have been joined unto thee, and have kept the  charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent;  and a stranger doth not come near unto you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and ye have kept the charge of the sanctuary, and the  charge of the altar, and there is no more wrath against the  sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`And I, lo, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the  midst of the sons of Israel; to you a gift they are given by  Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and thou, and thy sons with thee, do keep your priesthood,  for everything of the altar, and within the vail, and ye have  served; a service of gift I make your priesthood; and the  stranger who is coming near is put to death.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron: `And I, lo, I have given  to thee the charge of My heave-offerings, of all the hallowed  things of the sons of Israel -- to thee I have given them for  the anointing, and to thy sons, by a statute age-during.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This is thine of the most holy things, from the fire: all  their offering, to all their present, and to all their  sin-offering, and to all their guilt-offering, which they give  back to Me, is most holy to thee, and to thy sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>in the holy of holies thou dost eat it; every male doth  eat it; holy it is to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`And this [is] thine: the heave-offering of their gift, to  all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel, to thee I have  given them, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by  a statute age-during; every clean one in thy house doth eat it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>all the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine,  and wheat -- their first-[fruits] which they give to Jehovah --  to thee I have given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`The first-fruits of all that [is] in their land, which  they bring in to Jehovah, are thine; every clean one in thy  house doth eat it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>every devoted thing in Israel is thine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>every one opening a womb of all flesh which they bring  near to Jehovah, among man and among beast, is thine; only,  thou dost certainly ransom the first-born of man, and the  firstling of the unclean beast thou dost ransom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And their ransomed ones from a son of a month, thou dost  ransom with thy valuation, of silver, five shekels, by the  shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs it [is].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`Only, the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a  sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou dost not ransom, holy  they [are]: their blood thou dost sprinkle on the altar, and of  their fat thou makest perfume, a fire-offering of sweet  fragrance to Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and their flesh is thine, as the breast of the  wave-offering, and as the right leg, it is thine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>all the heave-offerings of the holy things which the sons  of Israel lift up to Jehovah I have given to thee and to thy  sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute age-during,  a covenant of salt, age-during it [is] before Jehovah, to thee  and to thy seed with thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `In their land thou dost not  inherit, and a portion thou hast not in their midst: I [am] thy  portion, and thine inheritance in the midst of the sons of  Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and to the sons of Levi, lo, I have given all the tenth in  Israel for inheritance in exchange for their service which they  are serving -- the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And the sons of Israel come no more near unto the tent of  meeting, to bear sin, to die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the Levites have done the service of the tent of  meeting, and they -- they bear their iniquity; a statute  age-during to your generations, that in the midst of the sons  of Israel they have no inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but the tithe of the sons of Israel which they lift up to  Jehovah, a heave-offering, I have given to the Levites for  inheritance; therefore I have said of them, In the midst of the  sons of Israel they have no inheritance.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And unto the Levites thou dost speak;

and ye have given from it the heave-offering of Jehovah  to Aaron the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>out of all your gifts ye do lift up the whole  heave-offering of Jehovah; out of all its fat, -- its hallowed  part -- out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`And thou hast said unto them, In your lifting up its fat  out of it, then it hath been reckoned to the Levites, as  increase of a threshing-floor, and as increase of a wine-vat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and ye have eaten it in every place, ye and your  households, for it [is] your hire in exchange for your service  in the tent of meeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and ye bear no sin for it, in your lifting up its fat out  of it, and the holy things of the sons of Israel ye do not  pollute, and ye die not.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
