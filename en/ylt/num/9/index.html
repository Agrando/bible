according to all that Jehovah hath  commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there are men who have been defiled by the body of a  man, and they have not been able to prepare the passover on  that day, and they come near before Moses, and before Aaron, on  that day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and those men say unto him, `We are defiled by the body of a  man; why are we withheld so as not to bring near the offering  of Jehovah in its appointed season, in the midst of the sons of  Israel?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses saith unto them, `Stand ye, and I hear what  Jehovah hath commanded concerning you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Though any man is  unclean by a body or in a distant journey (of you or of your  generations), yet he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>in the second month, on the fourteenth day, between the  evenings they prepare it; with unleavened and bitter things  they eat it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>they do not leave of till morning; and a bone they do not  break in it: according to all the statute of the passover they  prepare it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`And the man who is clean, and hath not been on a journey,  and hath ceased to prepare the passover, even that person hath  been cut off from his people; because the offering of Jehovah  he hath not brought near, in its appointed season, that man  doth bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And when a sojourner sojourneth with you, then he hath  prepared a passover to Jehovah, according to the statute of the  passover, and according to its ordinance, so he doth; one  statute is to you, even to a sojourner, and to a native of the  land.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in the day of the raising up of the tabernacle hath the  cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony;

and in the  place where the cloud doth tabernacle, there do the sons of  Israel encamp;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>by the command of Jehovah the sons of Israel journey, and  by the command of Jehovah they encamp; all the days that the  cloud doth tabernacle over the tabernacle they encamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle many  days, then have the sons of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah,  and journey not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and so when the cloud is a number of days over the  tabernacle; by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the  command of Jehovah they journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so when the cloud is from evening till morning, when  the cloud hath gone up in the morning, then they have  journeyed;
