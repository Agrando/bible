the murmurings of the sons of Israel,  which they are murmuring against Me, I have heard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>say unto them, I live -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- if,  as ye have spoken in Mine ears -- so I do not to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>in this wilderness do your carcases fall, even all your  numbered ones, to all your number, from a son of twenty years  and upward, who have murmured against Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>ye -- ye come not in unto the land which I have lifted up  My hand to cause you to tabernacle in it, except Caleb son of  Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`As to your infants -- of whom ye have said, A spoil they  are become -- I have even brought them in, and they have known  the land which ye have kicked against;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>as to you -- your carcases do fall in this wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and your sons are evil in the wilderness forty years, and  have borne your whoredoms till your carcases are consumed in  the wilderness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>by the number of the days [in] which ye spied the land,  forty days, -- a day for a year, a day for a year -- ye do bear  your iniquities, forty years, and ye have known my breaking  off;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I [am] Jehovah, I have spoken; if I do not this to all  this evil company who are meeting against me; -- in this  wilderness they are consumed, and there they die.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land, and they  turn back and cause all the company to murmur against him, by  bringing out an evil account concerning the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>even the men bringing out an evil account of the land die  by the plague before Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, have  lived of those men who go to spy out the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Moses speaketh these words unto all the sons of  Israel, and the people mourn exceedingly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and they rise early in the morning, and go up unto the top  of the mountain, saying, `Here we [are], and we have come up  unto the place which Jehovah hath spoken of, for we have  sinned.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Moses saith, `Why [is] this? -- ye are transgressing  the command of Jehovah, and it doth not prosper;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>go not up, for Jehovah is not in your midst, and ye are  not smitten before your enemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for the Amalekite and the Canaanite [are] there before  you, and ye have fallen by the sword, because that ye have  turned back from after Jehovah, and Jehovah is not with you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they presume to go up unto the top of the mountain,  and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and Moses have not  departed out of the midst of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who are dwelling in  that mountain come down and smite them, and beat them down --  unto Hormah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
