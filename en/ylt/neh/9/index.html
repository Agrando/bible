for a God, gracious and  merciful, [art] Thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>`And now, O our God -- God, the great, the mighty, and the  fearful, keeping the covenant and the kindness -- let not all  the travail that hath found us be little before Thee, for our  kings, for our heads, and for our priests, and for our  prophets, and for our fathers, and for all Thy people, from the  days of the kings of Asshur unto this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and Thou [art] righteous concerning all that hath come upon  us, for truth Thou hast done, and we have done wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and our kings, our heads, our priests, and our fathers,  have not done Thy law, nor attended unto Thy commands, and to  Thy testimonies, that Thou hast testified against them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they, in their kingdom, and in Thine abundant goodness,  that Thou hast given to them, and in the land, the large and the  fat, that Thou hast set before them, have not served Thee, nor  turned back from their evil doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>`Lo, we -- to-day -- [are] servants, and the land that Thou  hast given to our fathers, to eat its fruit and its good -- lo,  we [are] servants on it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and its increase it is multiplying to the kings whom Thou  hast set over us in our sins; and over our bodies they are  ruling, and over our cattle, according to their pleasure, and  we [are] in great distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And for all this we are making a stedfast covenant, and are  writing, and over him who is sealed [are] our heads, our  Levites, our priests.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
