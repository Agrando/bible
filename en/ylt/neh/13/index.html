and our God bringeth in on  us all this evil, and on this city, and ye are adding  fierceness on Israel, to pollute the sabbath.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it cometh to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem have  been dark before the sabbath, that I speak, and the doors are  shut, and I say, that they do not open them till after the  sabbath; and of my servants I have stationed at the gates;  there doth not come in a burden on the sabbath-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they lodge -- the merchants and sellers of all ware --  at the outside of Jerusalem, once or twice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I testify against them, and say unto them, `Wherefore  are ye lodging over-against the wall? if ye repeat [it], a hand  I put forth upon you;` from that time they have not come in on  the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I say to the Levites, that they be cleansed, and,  coming in, keeping the gates, to sanctify the sabbath-day.  Also, this, remember for me, O my God, and have pity on me,  according to the abundance of Thy kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Also, in those days, I have seen the Jews [who] have  settled women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And of their sons, half are speaking Ashdoditish -- and  are not knowing to speak Jewish -- and according to the  language of people and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I strive with them, and declare them vile, and smite  certain of them, and pluck off their hair, and cause them to  swear by God, `Ye do not give your daughters to their sons, nor  do ye take of their daughters to your sons, and to yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`By these did not Solomon king of Israel sin? and among  the many nations there was no king like him, and beloved by his  God he was, and God maketh him king over all Israel -- even him  did the strange women cause to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And to you do we hearken to do all this great evil, to  trespass against our God, to settle strange women?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And [one] of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high  priest, [is] son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite, and I cause  him to flee from off me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Be mindful of them, O my God, for the redeemed of the  priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the  Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I have cleansed them from every stranger, and appoint  charges to priests and to Levites, each in his work,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and for the wood-offering at appointed times, and for  first-fruits. Be mindful of me, O my God, for good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
