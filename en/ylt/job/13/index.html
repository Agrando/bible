I am  not fallen more than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yet I for the Mighty One do speak, And to argue for God I  delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And yet, ye [are] forgers of falsehood, Physicians of  nought -- all of you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O that ye would keep perfectly silent, And it would be to  you for wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hear, I pray you, my argument, And to the pleadings of my  lips attend,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For God do ye speak perverseness? And for Him do ye speak  deceit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>His face do ye accept, if for God ye strive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is [it] good that He doth search you, If, as one mocketh at  a man, ye mock at Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He doth surely reprove you, if in secret ye accept faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Doth not His excellency terrify you?
