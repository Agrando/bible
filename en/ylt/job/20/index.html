Since the placing of  man on earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That the singing of the wicked [is] short, And the joy of  the profane for a moment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head  against a cloud he strike --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say:  `Where [is] he?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is  driven away as a vision of the night,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again  doth his place behold him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his  wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the  dust it lieth down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it  under his tongue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back  in the midst of his palate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His food in his bowels is turned, The bitterness of asps  [is] in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wealth he hath swallowed, and doth vomit it. From his  belly God driveth it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gall of asps he sucketh, Slay him doth the tongue of a  viper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and  butter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He is giving back [what] he laboured for, And doth not  consume [it]; As a bulwark [is] his exchange, and he exults  not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he oppressed -- he forsook the poor, A house he hath  taken violently away, And he doth not build it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his  desirable thing he delivereth not himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is not a remnant to his food, Therefore his good  doth not stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every  perverse hand doth meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth  forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth  on him in his eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow  of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a  glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him [are]  terrors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a  fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising  itself against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a  day of His anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This [is] the portion of a wicked man from God. And an  inheritance appointed him by God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
