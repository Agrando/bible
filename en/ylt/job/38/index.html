Declare, if thou hast  known understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who placed its measures -- if thou knowest? Or who hath  stretched out upon it a line?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its  corner-stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons  of God shout for joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth,  from the womb it goeth out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its  swaddling band,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And say, `Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command  is placed On the pride of thy billows.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou  the dawn to know its place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked  are shaken out of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station  themselves as clothed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm  lifted up is broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hast thou come in to springs of the sea?

Or who hath given  To the covered part understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Who doth number the clouds by wisdom? And the bottles of  the heavens, Who doth cause to lie down,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>In the hardening of dust into hardness, And clods cleave  together?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Dost thou hunt for a lion prey? And the desire of young  lions fulfil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When they bow down in dens -- Abide in a thicket for a  covert?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Who doth prepare for a raven his provision, When his young  ones cry unto God? They wander without food.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
