The bringing forth of hinds thou dost mark!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou dost number the months they fulfil? And thou hast  known the time of their bringing forth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They bow down, Their young ones they bring forth safely,  Their pangs they cast forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Safe are their young ones, They grow up in the field, they  have gone out, And have not returned to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who hath sent forth the wild ass free? Yea, the bands of  the wild ass who opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whose house I have made the wilderness, And his dwellings  the barren land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He doth laugh at the multitude of a city, The cries of an  exactor he heareth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The range of mountains [is] his pasture, And after every  green thing he seeketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is a Reem willing to serve thee?

And  dost thou leave unto him thy labour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Dost thou trust in him That he doth bring back thy seed?  And [to] thy threshing-floor doth gather [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The wing of the rattling ones exulteth, Whether the pinion  of the ostrich or hawk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For she leaveth on the earth her eggs, And on the dust she  doth warm them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she forgetteth that a foot may press it, And a beast  of the field tread it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Her young ones it hath hardened without her, In vain [is]  her labour without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God hath caused her to forget wisdom, And He hath not  given a portion To her in understanding:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the time on high she lifteth herself up, She laugheth  at the horse and at his rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Dost thou give to the horse might?
