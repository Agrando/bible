And  my flesh hath taken fright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore do the wicked live? They have become old, Yea,  they have been mighty in wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their seed is established, Before their face with them, And  their offspring before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their houses [are] peace without fear, Nor [is] a rod of  God upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His bullock hath eaten corn, and doth not loath. His cow  bringeth forth safely, And doth not miscarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They send forth as a flock their sucklings, And their  children skip,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They lift [themselves] up at timbrel and harp, And rejoice  at the sound of an organ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They wear out in good their days, And in a moment [to]  Sheol go down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they say to God, `Turn aside from us, And the  knowledge of Thy ways We have not desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What [is] the Mighty One that we serve Him? And what do we  profit when we meet with Him?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lo, not in their hand [is] their good, (The counsel of the  wicked Hath been far from me.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How oft is the lamp of the wicked extinguished, And come  on them doth their calamity? Pangs He apportioneth in His  anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They are as straw before wind, And as chaff a hurricane  hath stolen away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God layeth up for his sons his sorrow, He giveth  recompense unto him -- and he knoweth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His own eyes see his destruction, And of the wrath of the  Mighty he drinketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For what [is] his delight in his house after him, And the  number of his months cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To God doth [one] teach knowledge, And He the high doth  judge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This [one] dieth in his perfect strength, Wholly at ease  and quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His breasts have been full of milk, And marrow his bones  doth moisten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this [one] dieth with a bitter soul, And have not  eaten with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Together -- on the dust they lie down, And the worm doth  cover them over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Lo, I have known your thoughts, And the devices against me  ye do wrongfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For ye say, `Where [is] the house of the noble?
