Mortal [is] mine arrow --  without transgression.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who [is] a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity,  So as to go with men of wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he hath said, `It doth not profit a man, When he  delighteth himself with God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from  God to do wickedness, And [from] the Mighty to do perverseness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to  the path of each He doth cause him to find.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth  not pervert judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath  placed all the habitable world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath  unto Him He gathereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if [there is] understanding, hear this, Give ear to  the voice of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost  thou condemn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who hath said to a king -- `Worthless,` Unto princes --  `Wicked?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath  known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands [are]  all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[In] a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people,  and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For His eyes [are] on the ways of each, And all his steps  He doth see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of  iniquity to be hidden there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in  judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He breaketh the mighty -- no searching! And He appointeth  others in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned  by night, And they are bruised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of  beholders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because that against right They have turned aside from  after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the  cry of the afflicted He heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the  face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to  a man, [It is] the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a  people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For unto God hath any said: `I have taken away, I do not  corruptly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Besides [that which] I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I  have done -- I do not add?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused -- That  thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening  to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job -- not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words  [are] not with wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>My Father! let Job be tried -- unto victory, Because of  answers for men of iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he  vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
