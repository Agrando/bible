He turned aside my judgment, And the Mighty --  He made my soul bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For all the while my breath [is] in me, And the spirit of  God in my nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My lips do not speak perverseness, And my tongue doth not  utter deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Pollution to me -- if I justify you, Till I expire I turn  not aside mine integrity from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On my righteousness I have laid hold, And I do not let it  go, My heart doth not reproach me while I live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As the wicked is my enemy, And my withstander as the  perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For what [is] the hope of the profane, When He doth cut  off?
