That Thou  despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the  wicked hast shone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth -- seest Thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As the days of man [are] Thy days? Thy years as the days of  a man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin  seekest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no  deliverer from Thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me  together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And  unto dust Thou dost bring me back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Dost Thou not as milk pour me out?
