What do I  profit from my sin?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold attentively the heavens -- and see, And behold the  clouds, They have been higher than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him?
