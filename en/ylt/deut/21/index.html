and the blood hath been pardoned to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and thou dost put away the innocent blood out of thy midst,  for thou dost that which [is] right in the eyes of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and  Jehovah thy God hath given them into thy hand, and thou hast  taken captive its captivity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and hast seen in the captivity a woman of fair form, and  hast delighted in her, and hast taken to thee for a wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then thou hast brought her in unto the midst of thy  household, and she hath shaved her head, and prepared her  nails,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and turned aside the raiment of her captivity from off  her, and hath dwelt in thy house, and bewailed her father and  her mother a month of days, and afterwards thou dost go in unto  her and hast married her, and she hath been to thee for a wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And it hath been -- if thou hast not delighted in her,  that thou hast sent her away at her desire, and thou dost not  at all sell her for money; thou dost not tyrannize over her,  because that thou hast humbled her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`When a man hath two wives, the one loved and the other  hated, and they have borne to him sons (the loved one and the  hated one), and the first-born son hath been to the hated one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then it hath been, in the day of his causing his sons to  inherit that which he hath, he is not able to declare  first-born the son of the loved one, in the face of the son of  the hated one -- the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the first-born, son of the hated one, he doth  acknowledge, to give to him a double portion of all that is  found with him, for he [is] the beginning of his strength; to  him [is] the right of the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`When a man hath a son apostatizing and rebellious -- he  is not hearkening to the voice of his father, and to the voice  of his mother, and they have chastised him, and he doth not  hearken unto them --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>then laid hold on him have his father and his mother, and  they have brought him out unto the elders of his city, and unto  the gate of his place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and have said unto the elders of his city, Our son -- this  one -- is apostatizing and rebellious; he is not hearkening to  our voice -- a glutton and drunkard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and all the men of his city have stoned him with stones,  and he hath died, and thou hast put away the evil out of thy  midst, and all Israel do hear and fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And when there is in a man a sin -- a cause of death, and  he hath been put to death, and thou hast hanged him on a tree,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>his corpse doth not remain on the tree, for thou dost  certainly bury him in that day -- for a thing lightly esteemed  of God [is] the hanged one -- and thou dost not defile thy  ground which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- an  inheritance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
