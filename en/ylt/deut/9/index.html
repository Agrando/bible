 cities great and fenced in the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>a people great and tall, sons of Anakim, whom thou -- thou  hast known, (and thou -- thou hast heard: Who doth station  himself before sons of Anak?)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and thou hast known to-day, that Jehovah thy God [is] He who  is passing over before thee -- a fire consuming; He doth  destroy them, and He doth humble them before thee, and thou  hast dispossessed them, and destroyed them hastily, as Jehovah  hath spoken to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>`Thou dost not speak in thy heart (in Jehovah thy God`s  driving them away from before thee), saying, For my  righteousness hath Jehovah brought me in to possess this land,  seeing for the wickedness of these nations is Jehovah  dispossessing them from thy presence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>not for thy righteousness, and for the uprightness of thy  heart, art thou going in to possess their land; but for the  wickedness of these nations is Jehovah thy God dispossessing  them from before thee; and in order to establish the word which  Jehovah hath sworn to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to  Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and thou hast known, that not for thy righteousness is  Jehovah thy God giving to thee this good land to possess it,  for a people stiff of neck thou [art].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`Remember -- do not forget -- that [with] which thou hast  made Jehovah thy God wroth in the wilderness; even from the day  that thou hast come out of the land of Egypt till your coming  in unto this place rebels ye have been with Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>even in Horeb ye have made Jehovah wroth, and Jehovah  sheweth Himself angry against you -- to destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`In my going up into the mount to receive the tables of  stone (tables of the covenant which Jehovah hath made with  you), and I abide in the mount forty days and forty nights;  bread I have not eaten, and water I have not drunk;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Jehovah giveth unto me the two tables of stone written  with the finger of God, and on them according to all the words  which Jehovah hath spoken with you in the mount, out of the  midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`And it cometh to pass, at the end of forty days and forty  nights, Jehovah hath given unto me the two tables of stone --  tables of the covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and Jehovah saith unto me, Rise, go down, hasten from this,  for thy people hath done corruptly, whom thou hast brought out  of Egypt; they have turned aside hastily out of the way which I  have commanded them -- they have made to themselves a molten  thing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`And Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying, I have seen this  people, and lo, a people stiff of neck it [is];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>desist from Me, and I destroy them, and blot out their name  from under the heavens, and I make thee become a nation more  mighty and numerous than it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>`And I turn, and come down from the mount, and the mount is  burning with fire, and the two tables of the covenant on my two  hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and I see, and lo, ye have sinned against Jehovah your God;  ye have made to yourselves a molten calf; ye have turned aside  hastily out of the way which Jehovah hath commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`And I lay hold on the two tables, and cast them out of my  two hands, and break them before your eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and I throw myself before Jehovah, as at first, forty days  and forty nights; bread I have not eaten, and water I have not  drunk, because of all your sins which ye have sinned, by doing  the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to make Him angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`For I have been afraid because of the anger and the fury  with which Jehovah hath been wroth against you, to destroy you;  and Jehovah doth hearken unto me also at this time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>`And with Aaron hath Jehovah shewed himself very angry, to  destroy him, and I pray also for Aaron at that time;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and your sin, which ye have made -- the calf -- I have  taken, and I burn it with fire, and beat it, grinding well till  that it [is] small as dust, and I cast its dust unto the brook  which is going down out of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And in Taberah, and in Massah, and in Kibroth-Hattaavah,  ye have been making Jehovah wroth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and in Jehovah`s sending you from Kadesh-Barnea, saying, Go  up, and possess the land which I have given to you, then ye  provoke the mouth of Jehovah your God, and have not given  credence to Him, nor hearkened to His voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>rebels ye have been with Jehovah from the day of my knowing  you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`And I throw myself before Jehovah, the forty days and the  forty nights, as I had thrown myself, for Jehovah hath said --  to destroy you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I pray unto Jehovah, and say, Lord Jehovah, destroy not  Thy people, and Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast ransomed in  Thy greatness; whom Thou hast brought out of Egypt with a  strong hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>be mindful of Thy servants, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of  Jacob, turn not unto the stiffness of this people, and unto its  wickedness, and unto its sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>lest the land say from which Thou hast brought us out,  Because of Jehovah`s want of ability to bring them in unto the  land of which He hath spoken to them, and because of His hating  them, He brought them out to put them to death in the  wilderness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and they [are] Thy people, and Thine inheritance, whom Thou  hast brought out by Thy great power, and by Thy stretched-out  arm!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
