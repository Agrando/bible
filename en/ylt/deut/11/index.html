of the rain of the heavens it  drinketh water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>a land which Jehovah thy God is searching; continually  [are] the eyes of Jehovah thy God upon it, from the beginning  of the year even unto the latter end of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`And it hath been -- if thou hearken diligently unto My  commands which I am commanding you to-day, to love Jehovah your  God, and to serve Him with all your heart, and with all your  soul --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that I have given the rain of your land in its season --  sprinkling and gathered -- and thou hast gathered thy corn, and  thy new wine, and thine oil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I have given herbs in thy field for thy cattle, and  thou hast eaten, and been satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be enticed, and  ye have turned aside, and served other gods, and bowed  yourselves to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the anger of Jehovah hath burned against you, and He  hath restrained the heavens, and there is no rain, and the  ground doth not give her increase, and ye have perished hastily  from off the good land which Jehovah is giving to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`And ye have placed these my words on your heart, and on  your soul, and have bound them for a sign on your hand, and  they have been for frontlets between your eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and ye have taught them to your sons, by speaking of them  in thy sitting in thy house, and in thy going in the way, and  in thy lying down, and in thy rising up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and hast written them on the side-posts of thy house, and  on thy gates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that your days are multiplied, and the days of your  sons, on the ground which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers to  give to them, as the days of the heavens on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`For, if ye diligently keep all this command which I am  commanding you -- to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk  in all His ways, and to cleave to Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then hath Jehovah dispossessed all these nations from  before you, and ye have possessed nations, greater and mightier  than you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth is  yours; from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the  river Phrat, even unto the farther sea is your border;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>no man doth station himself in your presence; your dread  and your fear doth Jehovah your God put on the face of all the  land on which ye tread, as He hath spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`See, I am setting before you to-day a blessing and a  reviling:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the blessing, when ye hearken unto the commands of Jehovah  your God, which I am commanding you to-day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the reviling, if ye do not hearken unto the commands  of Jehovah your God, and have turned aside out of the way which  I am commanding you to-day, to go after other gods which ye  have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`And it hath been, when Jehovah thy God doth bring thee in  unto the land whither thou art going in to possess it, that  thou hast given the blessing on mount Gerizim, and the reviling  on mount Ebal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the  going in of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite, who is  dwelling in the plain over-against Gilgal, near the oaks of  Moreh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for ye are passing over the Jordan to go in to possess the  land which Jehovah your God is giving to you; and ye have  possessed it, and dwelt in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and observed to do all the statutes and the judgments  which I am setting before you to day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
