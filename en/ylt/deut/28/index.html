and he hath put a yoke of iron on thy  neck, till He hath destroyed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>`Jehovah doth lift up against thee a nation, from afar,  from the end of the earth, as the eagle it flieth; a nation  whose tongue thou hast not heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>a nation -- fierce of countenance -- which accepteth not  the face of the aged, and the young doth not favour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and it hath eaten the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit  of thy ground, till thou art destroyed; which leaveth not to  thee corn, new wine, and oil, increase of thine oxen, and  wealth of thy flock, till it hath destroyed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>`And it hath laid siege to thee in all thy gates, till thy  walls come down, the high and the fenced ones in which thou art  trusting, in all thy land; yea, it hath laid siege to thee in  all thy gates, in all thy land, which Jehovah thy God hath  given to thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and thou hast eaten the fruit of thy body, flesh of thy  sons and thy daughters (whom Jehovah thy God hath given to  thee), in the siege, and in the straitness with which thine  enemies do straiten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>`The man who is tender in thee, and who [is] very delicate  -- his eye is evil against his brother, and against the wife of  his bosom, and against the remnant of his sons whom he leaveth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>against giving to one of them of the flesh of his sons  whom he eateth, because he hath nothing left to him, in the  siege, and in the straitness with which thine enemy doth  straiten thee in all thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>`The tender woman in thee, and the delicate, who hath not  tried the sole of her foot to place on the ground because of  delicateness and because of tenderness -- her eye is evil  against the husband of her bosom, and against her son, and  against her daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and against her seed which cometh out from between her  feet, even against her sons whom she doth bear, for she doth  eat them for the lacking of all things in secret, in the siege  and in the straitness with which thine enemy doth straiten thee  within thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>`If thou dost not observe to do all the words of this law  which are written in this book, to fear this honoured and  fearful name -- Jehovah thy God --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>then hath Jehovah made wonderful thy strokes, and the  strokes of thy seed -- great strokes, and stedfast, and evil  sicknesses, and stedfast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>`And He hath brought back on thee all the diseases of  Egypt, of the presence of which thou hast been afraid, and they  have cleaved to thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>also every sickness and every stroke which is not written  in the book of this law; Jehovah doth cause them to go up upon  thee till thou art destroyed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>and ye have been left with few men, instead of which ye  have been as stars of the heavens for multitude, because thou  hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>`And it hath been, as Jehovah hath rejoiced over you to do  you good, and to multiply you, so doth Jehovah rejoice over you  to destroy you, and to lay you waste; and ye have been pulled  away from off the ground whither thou art going in to possess  it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and Jehovah hath scattered thee among all the peoples,  from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth; and  thou hast served there other gods which thou hast not known,  thou and thy fathers -- wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>`And among those nations thou dost not rest, yea, there is  no resting-place for the sole of thy foot, and Jehovah hath  given to thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and  grief of soul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>and thy life hath been hanging in suspense before thee,  and thou hast been afraid by night and by day, and dost not  believe in thy life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>in the morning thou sayest, O that it were evening! and in  the evening thou sayest, O that it were morning! from the fear  of thy heart, with which thou art afraid, and from the sight of  thine eyes which thou seest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>`And Jehovah hath brought thee back to Egypt with ships,  by a way of which I said to thee, Thou dost not add any more to  see it, and ye have sold yourselves there to thine enemies, for  men-servants and for maid-servants, and there is no buyer.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
