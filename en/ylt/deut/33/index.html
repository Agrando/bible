He hath shone from mount Paran, And  hath come [with] myriads of holy ones; At His right hand [are]  springs for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Also He [is] loving the peoples; All His holy ones [are] in  thy hand, And they -- they sat down at thy foot, [Each] He  lifteth up at thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A law hath Moses commanded us, A possession of the assembly  of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he is in Jeshurun king, In the heads of the people  gathering together, The tribes of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let Reuben live, and not die, And let his men be a number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this [is] for Judah; and he saith: -- Hear, O Jehovah,  the voice of Judah, And unto his people do Thou bring him in;  His hand hath striven for him, And an help from his adversaries  art Thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And of Levi he said: -- Thy Thummim and thy Urim [are] for  thy pious one, Whom Thou hast tried in Massah, Thou dost strive  with Him at the waters of Meribah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Who is saying of his father and his mother, I have not seen  him; And his brethren he hath not discerned, And his sons he  hath not known; For they have observed Thy saying, And Thy  covenant they keep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They teach Thy judgments to Jacob, And Thy law to Israel;  They put perfume in Thy nose, And whole burnt-offering on Thine  altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Bless, O Jehovah, his strength, And the work of his hands  Thou acceptest, Smite the loins of his withstanders, And of  those hating him -- that they rise not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Of Benjamin he said: -- The beloved of Jehovah doth  tabernacle confidently by him, Covering him over all the day;  Yea, between his shoulders He doth tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And of Joseph he said: -- Blessed of Jehovah [is] his  land, By precious things of the heavens, By dew, and by the  deep crouching beneath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And by precious things -- fruits of the sun, And by  precious things -- cast forth by the moons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And by chief things -- of the ancient mountains, And by  precious things -- of the age-during heights,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And by precious things -- of earth and its fulness, And  the good pleasure Of Him who is dwelling in the bush, -- Let it  come for the head of Joseph, And for the crown of him Who is  separate from his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His honour [is] a firstling of his ox, And his horns [are]  horns of a reem; By them peoples he doth push together To the  ends of earth; And they [are] the myriads of Ephraim, And they  [are] the thousands of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And of Zebulun he said: -- Rejoice, O Zebulun, in thy  going out, And, O Issachar, in thy tents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Peoples [to] the mountain they call, There they sacrifice  righteous sacrifices; For the abundance of the seas they suck,  And hidden things hidden in the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And of Gad he said: -- Blessed of the Enlarger [is] Gad,  As a lioness he doth tabernacle, And hath torn the arm -- also  the crown!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he provideth the first part for himself, For there the  portion of the lawgiver is covered, And he cometh [with] the  heads of the people; The righteousness of Jehovah he hath done,  And His judgments with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And of Dan he said: -- Dan [is] a lion`s whelp; he doth  leap from Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of Naphtali he said: -- O Naphtali, satisfied with  pleasure, And full of the blessing of Jehovah, West and south  possess thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And of Asher he said: -- Blessed with sons [is] Asher, Let  him be accepted by his brethren, And dipping in oil his foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Iron and brass [are] thy shoes, And as thy days -- thy  strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Riding the heavens  in thy help, And in His excellency the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A habitation [is] the eternal God, And beneath [are] arms  age-during. And He casteth out from thy presence the enemy, and  saith, `Destroy!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Israel doth tabernacle [in] confidence alone; The eye  of Jacob [is] unto a land of corn and wine; Also His heavens  drop down dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O thy happiness, O Israel! who is like thee? A people  saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And He who [is] the  sword of thine excellency: And thine enemies are subdued for  thee, And thou on their high places dost tread.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
