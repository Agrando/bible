and  thou hast made them known to thy sons, and to thy sons` sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`The day when thou hast stood before Jehovah thy God in  Horeb -- in Jehovah`s saying unto me, Assemble to Me the  people, and I cause them to hear My words, so that they learn  to fear Me all the days that they are alive on the ground, and  their sons they teach; --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and ye draw near and stand under the mountain, and the  mountain is burning with fire unto the heart of the heavens --  darkness, cloud, yea, thick darkness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And Jehovah speaketh unto you out of the midst of the  fire; a voice of words ye are hearing and a similitude ye are  not seeing, only a voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and He declareth to you His covenant, which He hath  commanded you to do, the Ten Matters, and He writeth them upon  two tables of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And me hath Jehovah commanded at that time to teach you  statutes and judgments, for your doing them in the land whither  ye are passing over to possess it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and ye have been very watchful of your souls, for ye have  not seen any similitude in the day of Jehovah`s speaking unto  you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest ye do corruptly, and have made to you a graven image,  a similitude of any figure, a form of male or female --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>a form of any beast which [is] in the earth -- a form of  any winged bird which flieth in the heavens --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>a form of any creeping thing on the ground -- a form of any  fish which [is] in the waters under the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`And lest thou lift up thine eyes towards the heavens, and  hast seen the sun, and the moon, and the stars, all the host of  the heavens, and thou hast been forced, and hast bowed thyself  to them, and served them, which Jehovah thy God hath  apportioned to all the peoples under the whole heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>`And you hath Jehovah taken, and He is bringing you out  from the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be to Him for a people --  an inheritance, as [at] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`And Jehovah hath shewed himself wroth with me because of  your words, and sweareth to my not passing over the Jordan, and  to my not going in unto the good land which Jehovah thy God is  giving to thee -- an inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for I am dying in this land; I am not passing over the  Jordan, and ye are passing over, and have possessed this good  land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of  Jehovah your God, which He hath made with you, and have made to  yourselves a graven image, a similitude of anything  [concerning] which Jehovah thy God hath charged thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for Jehovah thy God is a fire consuming -- a zealous God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`When thou begettest sons and sons` sons, and ye have  become old in the land, and have done corruptly, and have made  a graven image, a similitude of anything, and have done the  evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger: --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have caused to testify against you this day the heavens  and the earth, that ye do perish utterly hastily from off the  land whither ye are passing over the Jordan to possess it; ye  do not prolong days upon it, but are utterly destroyed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and Jehovah hath scattered you among the peoples, and ye  have been left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah  leadeth you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and ye have served there gods, work of man`s hands, wood  and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`And -- ye have sought from thence Jehovah thy God, and  hast found, when thou seekest Him with all thy heart, and with  all thy soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>in distress [being] to thee, and all these things have  found thee, in the latter end of the days, and thou hast turned  back unto Jehovah thy God, and hast hearkened to His voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for a merciful God [is] Jehovah thy God; He doth not fail  thee, nor destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers,  which He hath sworn to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>`For, ask, I pray thee, at the former days which have been  before thee, from the day that God prepared man on the earth,  and from the [one] end of the heavens even unto the [other] end  of the heavens, whether there hath been as this great thing --  or hath been heard like it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hath a people heard the voice of God speaking out of the  midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, thou -- and doth live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Or hath God tried to go in to take to Himself, a nation  from the midst of a nation, by trials, by signs, and by  wonders, and by war, and by a strong hand, and by a  stretched-out arm, and by great terrors -- according to all  that Jehovah your God hath done to you, in Egypt, before your  eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thou, thou hast been shewn [it], to know that Jehovah He  [is] God; there is none else besides Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>`From the heavens He hath caused thee to hear His voice, to  instruct thee, and on earth He hath shewed thee His great fire,  and His words thou hast heard out of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>`And because that He hath loved thy fathers, He doth also  fix on their seed after them, and doth bring thee out, in His  presence, by His great power, from Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>to dispossess nations greater and stronger than thou, from  thy presence, to bring thee in to give to thee their land -- an  inheritance, as [at] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>`And thou hast known to-day, and hast turned [it] back unto  thy heart, that Jehovah He [is] God, in the heavens above, and  on the earth beneath -- there is none else;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and thou hast kept His statutes and His commands which I am  commanding thee to-day, so that it is well to thee, and to thy  sons after thee, and so that thou prolongest days on the ground  which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- all the days.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Moses separateth three cities beyond the Jordan,  towards the sun-rising,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for the fleeing thither of the man-slayer, who slayeth his  neighbour unknowingly, and he is not hating him heretofore, and  he hath fled unto one of these cities, and he hath lived:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Bezer, in the wilderness, in the land of the plain, of the  Reubenite; and Ramoth, in Gilead, of the Gadite; and Golan, in  Bashan, of the Manassahite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And this [is] the law which Moses hath set before the sons  of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>these [are] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the  judgments, which Moses hath spoken unto the sons of Israel, in  their coming out of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>beyond the Jordan, in the valley over-against Beth-Peor, in  the land of Sihon, king of the Amorite, who is dwelling in  Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel have smitten, in  their coming out of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and they possess his land, and the land of Og king of  Bashan, two kings of the Amorite who [are] beyond the Jordan,  [towards] the sun-rising;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>from Aroer, which [is] by the edge of the brook Arnon, even  unto mount Sion, which [is] Hermon --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and all the plain beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the  sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
