for it [is] the  abomination of Jehovah thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>`When there is found in thy midst, in one of thy cities  which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee, a man or a woman who  doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah thy God by  transgressing His covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he doth go and serve other gods, and doth bow himself  to them, and to the sun, or to the moon, or to any of the host  of the heavens, which I have not commanded --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and it hath been declared to thee, and thou hast heard, and  hast searched diligently, and lo, truth; the thing is  established; this abomination hath been done in Israel --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>`Then thou hast brought out that man, or that woman, who  hath done this evil thing, unto thy gates -- the man or the  woman -- and thou hast stoned them with stones, and they have  died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>By the mouth of two witnesses or of three witnesses is he  who is dead put to death; he is not put to death by the mouth  of one witness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>the hand of the witnesses is on him, in the first place, to  put him to death, and the hand of all the people last; and thou  hast put away the evil thing out of thy midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`When anything is too hard for thee for judgment, between  blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and  stroke -- matters of strife within thy gates -- then thou hast  risen, and gone up unto the place on which Jehovah thy God doth  fix,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and hast come in unto the priests, the Levites, and unto  the judge who is in those days, and hast inquired, and they  have declared to thee the word of judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and thou hast done according to the tenor of the word  which they declare to thee ([they] of that place which Jehovah  doth choose; and thou hast observed to do according to all that  they direct thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`According to the tenor of the law which they direct thee,  and according to the judgment which they say to thee thou dost  do; thou dost not turn aside from the word which they declare  to thee, right or left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man who acteth with presumption, so as not to  hearken unto the priest (who is standing to serve there Jehovah  thy God), or unto the judge, even that man hath died, and thou  hast put away the evil thing from Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and all the people do hear and fear, and do not presume  any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`When thou comest in unto the land which Jehovah thy God  is giving to thee, and hast possessed it, and dwelt in it, and  thou hast said, Let me set over me a king like all the nations  which [are] round about me, --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>thou dost certainly set over thee a king on whom Jehovah  doth fix; from the midst of thy brethren thou dost set over  thee a king; thou art not able to set over thee a stranger, who  is not thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`Only, he doth not multiply to himself horses, nor cause  the people to turn back to Egypt, so as to multiply horses,  seeing Jehovah hath said to you, Ye do not add to turn back in  this way any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he doth not multiply to himself wives, and his heart  doth not turn aside, and silver and gold he doth not multiply  to himself -- exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`And it hath been, when he sitteth on the throne of his  kingdom, that he hath written for himself the copy of this law,  on a book, from [that] before the priests the Levites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and it hath been with him, and he hath read in it all days  of his life, so that he doth learn to fear Jehovah his God, to  keep all the words of this law, and these statutes, to do them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that his heart is not high above his brethren, and so  as not to turn aside from the command, right or left, so that  he prolongeth days over his kingdom, he and his sons, in the  midst of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
