him strengthen thou; for he doth cause Israel to  inherit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>`And your infants, of whom ye have said, For a prey they  are, and your sons who have not known to-day good and evil,  they go in thither, and to them I give it, and they possess it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and ye, turn for yourselves, and journey toward the  wilderness, the way of the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>`And ye answer and say unto me, We have sinned against  Jehovah; we -- we go up, and we have fought, according to all  that which Jehovah our God hath commanded us; and ye gird on  each his weapons of war, and ye are ready to go up into the  hill-country;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and Jehovah saith unto me, Say to them, Ye do not go up,  nor fight, for I am not in your midst, and ye are not smitten  before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>`And I speak unto you, and ye have not hearkened, and  provoke the mouth of Jehovah, and act proudly, and go up into  the hill-country;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the Amorite who is dwelling in that hill-country cometh  out to meet you, and they pursue you as the bees do, and smite  you in Seir -- unto Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>`And ye turn back and weep before Jehovah, and Jehovah hath  not hearkened to your voice, nor hath he given ear unto you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and ye dwell in Kadesh many days, according to the days  which ye had dwelt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
