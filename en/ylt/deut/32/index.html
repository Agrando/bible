Is not He thy father -- thy possessor? He made thee, and doth  establish thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember days of old -- Understand the years of many  generations -- Ask thy father, and he doth tell thee; Thine  elders, and they say to thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In the Most High causing nations to inherit, In His  separating sons of Adam -- He setteth up the borders of the  peoples By the number of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For Jehovah`s portion [is] His people, Jacob [is] the line  of His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He findeth him in a land -- a desert, And in a void -- a  howling wilderness, He turneth him round -- He causeth him to  understand -- He keepeth him as the apple of His eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As an eagle waketh up its nest, Over its young ones  fluttereth, Spreadeth its wings -- taketh them, Beareth them on  its pinions; --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jehovah alone doth lead him, And there is no strange god  with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He maketh him ride on high places of earth, And he eateth  increase of the fields, And He maketh him suck honey from a  rock, And oil out of the flint of a rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of  lambs, and rams, sons of Bashan, And he-goats, with fat of  kidneys of wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou dost drink  wine!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jeshurun waxeth fat, and doth kick: Thou hast been fat  -- thou hast been thick, Thou hast been covered. And he leaveth  God who made him, And dishonoureth the Rock of his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They make Him zealous with strangers, With abominations  they make Him angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They sacrifice to demons -- no god!

And the teeth of beasts I send upon them, With  poison of fearful things of the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Without bereave doth the sword, And at the inner-chambers  -- fear, Both youth and virgin, Suckling with man of grey hair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have said: I blow them away, I cause their remembrance  to cease from man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If not -- the anger of an enemy I fear, Lest their  adversaries know -- Lest they say, Our hand is high, And  Jehovah hath not wrought all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For a nation lost to counsels [are] they, And there is no  understanding in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If they were wise -- They deal wisely [with] this; They  attend to their latter end:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How doth one pursue a thousand, And two cause a myriad to  flee! If not -- that their rock hath sold them, And Jehovah  hath shut them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For not as our Rock [is] their rock, (And our enemies  [are] judges!)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For of the vine of Sodom their vine [is], And of the  fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes [are] grapes of gall -- They  have bitter clusters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The poison of dragons [is] their wine And the fierce venom  of asps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Is it not laid up with Me? Sealed among My treasures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Mine [are] vengeance and recompense, At the due time --  doth their foot slide; For near is a day of their calamity, And  haste do things prepared for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants  doth repent Himself. For He seeth -- the going away of power,  And none is restrained and left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He hath said, Where [are] their gods -- The rock in  which they trusted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Which the fat of their sacrifices do eat, They drink the  wine of their libation! Let them arise and help you, Let it be  for you a hiding-place!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See ye, now, that I -- I [am] He, And there is no god with  Me: I put to death, and I keep alive; I have smitten, and I  heal; And there is not from My hand a deliverer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For I lift up unto the heavens My hand, And have said, I  live -- to the age!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>If I have sharpened the brightness of My sword, And My  hand doth lay hold on judgment, I turn back vengeance to Mine  adversaries, And to those hating Me -- I repay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I make drunk Mine arrows with blood, And My sword  devoureth flesh, From the blood of the pierced and captive,  From the head of the freemen of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Sing ye nations -- [with] his people, For the blood of His  servants He avengeth, And vengeance He turneth back on His  adversaries, And hath pardoned His land -- His people.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Moses cometh and speaketh all the words of this song  in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea son of Nun;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and Moses finisheth to speak all these words unto all  Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and saith unto them, `Set your heart to all the words  which I am testifying against you to-day, that ye command your  sons to observe to do all the words of this law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>for it [is] not a vain thing for you, for it [is] your  life, and by this thing ye prolong days on the ground whither  ye are passing over the Jordan to possess it.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in this self-same day,  saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>`Go up unto this mount Abarim, mount Nebo, which [is] in  the land of Moab, which [is] on the front of Jericho, and see  the land of Canaan which I am giving to the sons of Israel for  a possession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and die in the mount whither thou art going up, and be  gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother hath died in the  mount Hor, and is gathered unto his people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>`Because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the sons  of Israel at the waters of Meribath-Kadesh, the wilderness of  Zin -- because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the sons of  Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>but over-against thou seest the land, and thither thou  dost not go in, unto the land which I am giving to the sons of  Israel.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
