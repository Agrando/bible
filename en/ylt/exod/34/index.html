seven days  thou dost eat unleavened things, as I have commanded thee, at  an appointed time, the month of Abib: for in the month of Abib  thou didst come out from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`All opening a womb [are] Mine, and every firstling of thy  cattle born a male, ox or sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the firstling of an ass thou dost ransom with a lamb;  and if thou dost not ransom, then thou hast beheaded it; every  first-born of thy sons thou dost ransom, and they do not  appear before Me empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`Six days thou dost work, and on the seventh day thou dost  rest;

and he  hath come out and hath spoken unto the sons of Israel that  which he is commanded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and the sons of Israel have seen the face of Moses that  the skin of the face of Moses hath shone, and Moses hath put  back the vail on his face until his going in to speak with Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
