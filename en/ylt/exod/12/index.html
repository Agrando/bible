from the sheep or from the goats ye do take [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`And it hath become a charge to you, until the fourteenth  day of this month, and the whole assembly of the company of  Israel have slaughtered it between the evenings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and they have taken of the blood, and have put on the two  side-posts, and on the lintel over the houses in which they eat  it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`And they have eaten the flesh in this night, roast with  fire; with unleavened things and bitters they do eat it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>ye do not eat of it raw, or boiled at all in water, but  roast with fire, its head with its legs, and with its inwards;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and ye do not leave of it till morning, and that which is  remaining of it till morning with fire ye do burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`And thus ye do eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on  your feet, and your staff in your hand, and ye have eaten it in  haste; it is Jehovah`s passover,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I have passed over through the land of Egypt during  this night, and have smitten every first-born in the land of  Egypt, from man even unto beast, and on all the gods of Egypt I  do judgments; I [am] Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`And the blood hath become a sign for you on the houses  where ye [are], and I have seen the blood, and have passed over  you, and a plague is not on you for destruction in My smiting  in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And this day hath become to you a memorial, and ye have  kept it a feast to Jehovah to your generations; -- a statute  age-during; ye keep it a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days ye eat unleavened things; only -- in the first  day ye cause leaven to cease out of your houses; for any one  eating anything fermented from the first day till the seventh  day, even that person hath been cut off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And in the first day [is] a holy convocation, and in the  seventh day ye have a holy convocation; any work is not done in  them, only that which is eaten by any person -- it alone is  done by you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and ye have observed the unleavened things, for in this  self-same day I have brought out your hosts from the land of  Egypt, and ye have observed this day to your generations -- a  statute age-during.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month,  in the evening, ye do eat unleavened things until the one and  twentieth day of the month, at evening;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>seven days leaven is not found in your houses, for any  [one] eating anything fermented -- that person hath been cut  off from the company of Israel, among the sojourners or among  the natives of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>anything fermented ye do not eat, in all your dwellings ye  do eat unleavened things.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses calleth for all the elders of Israel, and saith  unto them, `Draw out and take for yourselves [from] the flock,  for your families, and slaughter the passover-sacrifice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and ye have taken a bunch of hyssop, and have dipped [it]  in the blood which [is] in the basin, and have struck [it] on  the lintel, and on the two side-posts, from the blood which  [is] in the basin, and ye, ye go not out each from the opening  of his house till morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`And Jehovah hath passed on to smite the Egyptians, and  hath seen the blood on the lintel, and on the two side-posts,  and Jehovah hath passed over the opening, and doth not permit  the destruction to come into your houses to smite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`And ye have observed this thing, for a statute to thee,  and to thy sons -- unto the age;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and it hath been, when ye come in unto the land which  Jehovah giveth to you, as He hath spoken, that ye have kept  this service;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and it hath come to pass when your sons say unto you, What  [is] this service ye have?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that ye have said, A sacrifice of passover it [is] to  Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in  Egypt, in His smiting the Egyptians, and our houses He  delivered.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the people bow and do obeisance, and the sons of  Israel go and do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; so have  they done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it cometh to pass, at midnight, that Jehovah hath  smitten every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the  first-born of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, unto the  first-born of the captive who [is] in the prison-house, and  every first-born of beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Pharaoh riseth by night, he and all his servants, and  all the Egyptians, and there is a great cry in Egypt, for there  is not a house where there is not [one] dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he calleth for Moses and for Aaron by night, and  saith, `Rise, go out from the midst of my people, both ye and  the sons of Israel, and go, serve Jehovah according to your  word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>both your flock and your herd take ye, as ye have spoken,  and go; then ye have blessed also me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Egyptians are urgent on the people, hasting to  send them away out of the land, for they said, `We are all  dead;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and the people taketh up its dough before it is fermented,  their kneading-troughs [are] bound up in their garments on  their shoulder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel have done according to the word of  Moses, and they ask from the Egyptians vessels of silver and  vessels of gold, and garments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and Jehovah hath given the grace of the people in the eyes  of the Egyptians, and they cause them to ask, and they spoil  the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the sons of Israel journey from Rameses to Succoth,  about six hundred thousand men on foot, apart from infants;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and a great rabble also hath gone up with them, and flock  and herd -- very much cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they bake with the dough which they have brought out  from Egypt unleavened cakes, for it hath not fermented; for  they have been cast out of Egypt, and have not been able to  delay, and also provision they have not made for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they have  dwelt in Egypt [is] four hundred and thirty years;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and it cometh to pass, at the end of four hundred and  thirty years -- yea, it cometh to pass in this self-same day --  all the hosts of Jehovah have gone out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>A night of watchings it [is] to Jehovah, to bring them out  from the land of Egypt; it [is] this night to Jehovah of  watchings to all the sons of Israel to their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses and Aaron, `This [is] a  statute of the passover; Any son of a stranger doth not eat of  it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and any man`s servant, the purchase of money, when thou  hast circumcised him -- then he doth eat of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>a settler or hired servant doth not eat of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>in one house it is eaten, thou dost not carry out of the  house [any] of the flesh without, and a bone ye do not break of  it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>all the company of Israel do keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>`And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee, and hath made  a passover to Jehovah, every male of his [is] to be  circumcised, and then he doth come near to keep it, and he hath  been as a native of the land, but any uncircumcised one doth  not eat of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>one law is to a native, and to a sojourner who is  sojourning in your midst.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And all the sons of Israel do as Jehovah commanded Moses  and Aaron; so have they done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it cometh to pass in this self-same day, Jehovah hath  brought out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, by their  hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
