and Israel encampeth  there before the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses hath gone up unto God, and Jehovah calleth unto  him out of the mount, saying, `Thus dost thou say to the house  of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye -- ye have seen that which I have done to the Egyptians,  and I bear you on eagles` wings, and bring you in unto Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>`And now, if ye really hearken to My voice, then ye have  kept My covenant, and been to Me a peculiar treasure more than  all the peoples, for all the earth [is] Mine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and ye -- ye are to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy  nation: these [are] the words which thou dost speak unto the  sons of Israel.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses cometh, and calleth for the elders of the people,  and setteth before them all these words which Jehovah hath  commanded him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and all the people answer together and say, `All that  Jehovah hath spoken we do;` and Moses returneth the words of  the people unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, I am coming unto thee in  the thickness of the cloud, so that the people hear in My  speaking with thee, and also believe in thee to the age;` and  Moses declareth the words of the people unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go unto the people; and  thou hast sanctified them to-day and to-morrow, and they have  washed their garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and have been prepared for the third day; for on the third  day doth Jehovah come down before the eyes of all the people,  on mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`And thou hast made a border [for] the people round about,  saying, Take heed to yourselves, going up into the mount, or  coming against its extremity; whoever is coming against the  mount is certainly put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>a hand cometh not against him, for he is certainly stoned  or shot through, whether beast or man it liveth not; in the  drawing out of the jubilee cornet they go up into the mount.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses cometh down from the mount unto the people, and  sanctifieth the people, and they wash their garments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he saith unto the people, `Be ye prepared for the  third day, come not nigh unto a woman.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it cometh to pass, on the third day, while it is  morning, that there are voices, and lightnings, and a heavy  cloud, on the mount, and the sound of a trumpet very strong;  and all the people who [are] in the camp do tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses bringeth out the people to meet God from the  camp, and they station themselves at the lower part of the  mount,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and mount Sinai [is] wholly a smoke from the presence of  Jehovah, who hath come down on it in fire, and its smoke goeth  up as smoke of the furnace, and the whole mount trembleth  exceedingly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the sound of the trumpet is going on, and very strong;  Moses speaketh, and God doth answer him with a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah cometh down on mount Sinai, unto the top of  the mount, and Jehovah calleth for Moses unto the top of the  mount, and Moses goeth up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go down, protest to the  people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to see, and many  of them have fallen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and also the priests who are coming nigh unto Jehovah do  sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `The people [is] unable to  come up unto mount Sinai, for Thou -- Thou hast protested to  us, saying, Make a border [for] the mount, then thou hast  sanctified it.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehovah saith unto him, `Go, descend, then thou hast  come up, thou, and Aaron with thee;
