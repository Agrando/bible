if he have nothing, then he hath been sold for  his theft;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>if the theft is certainly found in his hand alive, whether  ox, or ass, or sheep -- double he repayeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>`When a man depastureth a field or vineyard, and hath sent  out his beast, and it hath pastured in the field of another,  [of] the best of his field, and the best of his vineyard, he  doth repay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`When fire goeth forth, and hath found thorns, and a stack,  or the standing corn, or the field, hath been consumed, he who  causeth the burning doth certainly repay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`When a man doth give unto his neighbour silver, or vessels  to keep, and it hath been stolen out of the man`s house; if the  thief is found, he repayeth double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`If the thief is not found, then the master of the house  hath been brought near unto God, whether he hath not put forth  his hand against the work of his neighbour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for every matter of transgression, for ox, for ass, for  sheep, for raiment, for any lost thing of which it is said that  it is his; unto God cometh the matter of them both; he whom God  doth condemn, he repayeth double to his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`When a man doth give unto his neighbour an ass, or ox, or  sheep, or any beast to keep, and it hath died, or hath been  hurt, or taken captive, none seeing --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>an oath of Jehovah is between them both, that he hath not  put forth his hand against the work of his neighbour, and its  owner hath accepted, and he doth not repay;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but if it is certainly stolen from him, he doth repay to  its owner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>if it is certainly torn, he bringeth it in -- a witness;  the torn thing he doth not repay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And when a man doth ask [anything] from his neighbour,  and it hath been hurt or hath died -- its owner not being with  it -- he doth certainly repay;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>if its owner [is] with it, he doth not repay, -- if it  [is] a hired thing, it hath come for its hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And when a man doth entice a virgin who [is] not  betrothed, and hath lain with her, he doth certainly endow her  to himself for a wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>if her father utterly refuse to give her to him, money he  doth weigh out according to the dowry of virgins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`A witch thou dost not keep alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`Whoever lieth with a beast is certainly put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>`He who is sacrificing to a god, save to Jehovah alone, is  devoted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>`And a sojourner thou dost not oppress, nor crush him, for  sojourners ye have been in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`Any widow or orphan ye do not afflict;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>if thou dost really afflict him, surely if he at all cry  unto Me, I certainly hear his cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Mine anger hath burned, and I have slain you by the  sword, and your wives have been widows, and your sons orphans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`If thou dost lend My poor people with thee money, thou  art not to him as a usurer;
