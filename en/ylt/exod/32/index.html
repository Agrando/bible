turn back from the heat of Thine  anger, and repent of the evil against Thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`Be mindful of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, Thy  servants, to whom Thou hast sworn by Thyself, and unto whom  Thou speakest: I multiply your seed as stars of the heavens,  and all this land, as I have said, I give to your seed, and  they have inherited to the age;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and Jehovah repenteth of the evil which He hath spoken of  doing to His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turneth, and goeth down from the mount, and the  two tables of the testimony [are] in his hand, tables written  on both their sides, on this and on that [are] they written;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the tables are the work of God, and the writing is the  writing of God, graven on the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua heareth the voice of the people in their  shouting, and saith unto Moses, `A noise of battle in the  camp!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he saith, `It is not the voice of the crying of might,  nor is it the voice of the crying of weakness -- a voice of  singing I am hearing.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it cometh to pass, when he hath drawn near unto the  camp, that he seeth the calf, and the dancing, and the anger of  Moses burneth, and he casteth out of his hands the tables, and  breaketh them under the mount;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he taketh the calf which they have made, and burneth  [it] with fire, and grindeth until [it is] small, and  scattereth on the face of the waters, and causeth the sons of  Israel to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses saith unto Aaron, `What hath this people done to  thee, that thou hast brought in upon it a great sin?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Aaron saith, `Let not the anger of my lord burn; thou  -- thou hast known the people that it [is] in evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they say to me, Make for us gods, who go before us,  for this Moses -- the man who brought us up out of the land of  Egypt -- we have not known what hath happened to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and I say to them, Whoso hath gold, let them break [it]  off, and they give to me, and I cast it into the fire, and this  calf cometh out.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses seeth the people that it [is] unbridled, for  Aaron hath made it unbridled for contempt among its  withstanders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and Moses standeth in the gate of the camp, and saith,  `Who [is] for Jehovah? -- unto me!` and all the sons of Levi  are gathered unto him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he saith to them, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel,  Put each his sword by his thigh, pass over and turn back from  gate to gate through the camp, and slay each his brother, and  each his friend, and each his relation.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Levi do according to the word of Moses,  and there fall of the people on that day about three thousand  men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and Moses saith, `Consecrate your hand to-day to Jehovah,  for a man [is] against his son, and against his brother, so as  to bring on you to-day a blessing.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that Moses saith  unto the people, `Ye -- ye have sinned a great sin, and now I  go up unto Jehovah, if so be I atone for your sin.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses turneth back unto Jehovah, and saith, `Oh this  people hath sinned a great sin, that they make to themselves a  god of gold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and now, if Thou takest away their sin -- and if not --  blot me, I pray thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Whoso hath sinned against  Me -- I blot him out of My book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and now, go, lead the people whithersoever I have spoken  to thee of; lo, My messenger goeth before thee, and in the day  of my charging -- then I have charged upon them their sin.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehovah plagueth the people, because they made the  calf which Aaron made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
