speak  unto them, saying, Between the evenings ye eat flesh, and in  the morning ye are satisfied [with] bread, and ye have known  that I [am] Jehovah your God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it cometh to pass in the evening, that the quail  cometh up, and covereth the camp, and in the morning there hath  been the lying of dew round about the camp,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the lying of the dew goeth up, and lo, on the face of  the wilderness a thin, bare thing, thin as hoar-frost on the  earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the sons of Israel see, and say one unto another,  `What [is] it?` for they have not known what it [is]; and Moses  saith unto them, `It [is] the bread which Jehovah hath given to  you for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`This [is] the thing which Jehovah hath commanded: Gather  of it each according to his eating, an omer for a poll; and the  number of your persons, take ye each for those in his tent.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel do so, and they gather, he who is  [gathering] much, and he who is [gathering] little;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they measure with an omer, and he who is [gathering]  much hath nothing over, and he who is [gathering] little hath  no lack, each according to his eating they have gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses saith unto them, `Let no man leave of it till  morning;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and they have not hearkened unto Moses, and some of them  do leave of it till morning, and it bringeth up worms and  stinketh; and Moses is wroth with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they gather it morning by morning, each according to  his eating; when the sun hath been warm, then it hath melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it cometh to pass on the sixth day, they have gathered  a second bread, two omers for one, and all the princes of the  company come in, and declare to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he saith unto them, `It [is] that which Jehovah hath  spoken [of]; a rest -- a holy sabbath to Jehovah -- [is]  to-morrow; that which ye bake, bake; and that which ye boil,  boil; and all that is over, let rest for yourselves in charge  till the morning.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they let it rest until the morning, as Moses hath  commanded, and it hath not stank, and a worm hath not been in  it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses saith, `Eat it to-day, for to-day [is] a sabbath  to Jehovah; to-day ye find it not in the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>six days ye do gather it, and in the seventh day -- the  sabbath -- in it there is none.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it cometh to pass on the seventh day, some of the  people have gone out to gather, and have not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `How long have ye refused to  keep My commands, and My laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>see, because Jehovah hath given to you the sabbath,  therefore He is giving to you on the sixth day bread of two  days; abide ye each [in] his place, no one doth go out from his  place on the seventh day.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the people rest on the seventh day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the house of Israel call its name Manna, and it [is]  as coriander seed, white; and its taste [is] as a cake with  honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses saith, `This [is] the thing which Jehovah hath  commanded: Fill the omer with it, for a charge for your  generations, so that they see the bread which I have caused you  to eat in the wilderness, in My bringing you out from the land  of Egypt.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses saith unto Aaron, `Take one pot, and put there  the fulness of the omer of manna, and let it rest before  Jehovah, for a charge for your generations;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>as Jehovah hath given commandment unto Moses, so doth  Aaron let it rest before the Testimony, for a charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel have eaten the manna forty years,  until their coming in unto the land to be inhabited; the manna  they have eaten till their coming in unto the extremity of the  land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and the omer is a tenth of the ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
