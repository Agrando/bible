[of]  shittim wood thou dost make it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth, (it is  square), and two cubits its height; its horns [are] of the  same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>`And thou hast overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its  sides round about, and its horns; and thou hast made to it a  crown of gold round about;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and two rings of gold thou dost make to it under its crown;  on its two ribs thou dost make [them], on its two sides, and  they have become places for staves, to bear it with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>`And thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast  overlaid them with gold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and thou hast put it before the vail, which [is] by the ark  of the testimony, before the mercy-seat which [is] over the  testimony, whither I am met with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`And Aaron hath made perfume on it, perfume of spices,  morning by morning; in his making the lamps right he doth  perfume it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and in Aaron`s causing the lamps to go up between the  evenings, he doth perfume it; a continual perfume before  Jehovah to your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`Ye do not cause strange perfume to go up upon it, and  burnt-offering, and present, and libation ye do not pour out on  it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Aaron hath made atonement on its horns, once in a  year, by the blood of the sin-offering of atonements; once in  a year doth he make atonement for it, to your generations; it  [is] most holy to Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>`When thou takest up the sum of the sons of Israel for  their numbers, then they have given each an atonement [for] his  soul to Jehovah in their being numbered, and there is no plague  among them in their being numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`This they do give, every one passing over unto those  numbered, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary (the  shekel [is] twenty gerahs); half a shekel [is] the  heave-offering to Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>every one passing over unto those numbered, from a son of  twenty years and upwards, doth give the heave-offering of  Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>the rich doth not multiply, and the poor doth not diminish  from the half-shekel, to give the heave-offering of Jehovah, to  make atonement for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And thou hast taken the atonement-money from the sons of  Israel, and hast given it for the service of the tent of  meeting; and it hath been to the sons of Israel for a memorial  before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`And thou hast made a laver of brass (and its base of  brass), for washing; and thou hast put it between the tent of  meeting and the altar, and hast put water there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Aaron and his sons have washed at it their hands and  their feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>in their going in unto the tent of meeting they wash  [with] water, and die not; or in their drawing nigh unto the  altar to minister, to perfume a fire-offering to Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then they have washed their hands and their feet, and they  die not, and it hath been to them a statute age-during, to him  and to his seed to their generations.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`And thou, take to thyself principal spices, wild honey  five hundred [shekels]; and spice-cinnamon, the half of that,  two hundred and fifty; and spice-cane two hundred and fifty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and cassia five hundred, by the shekel of the sanctuary,  and olive oil a hin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and thou hast made it a holy anointing oil, a compound  mixture, work of a compounder; it is a holy anointing oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And thou hast anointed with it the tent of meeting, and  the ark of the testimony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and  its vessels, and the altar of perfume,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and  the laver and its base;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and thou hast sanctified them, and they have been most  holy; all that is coming against them is holy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and Aaron and his sons thou dost anoint, and hast  sanctified them for being priests to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, A  holy anointing oil is this to Me, to your generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>on flesh of man it is not poured, and with its proper  proportion ye make none like it; it [is] holy; it is holy to  you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>a man who compoundeth [any] like it, or who putteth of it  on a stranger -- hath even been cut off from his people.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Take to thee spices,  stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, spices and pure frankincense;  they are part for part;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and thou hast made it a perfume, a compound, work of a  compounder, salted, pure, holy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and thou hast beaten [some] of it small, and hast put of  it before the testimony, in the tent of meeting, whither I am  met with thee; most holy it is to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>`As to the perfume which thou makest, with its proper  proportion ye do not make to yourselves, holy it is to thee to  Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>a man who maketh [any] like it -- to be refreshed by it --  hath even been cut off from his people.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
