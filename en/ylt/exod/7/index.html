and Aaron casteth his rod  before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it becometh a  monster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Pharaoh also calleth for wise men, and for sorcerers;  and the scribes of Egypt, they also, with their flashings, do  so,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they cast down each his rod, and they become monsters,  and the rod of Aaron swalloweth their rods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he hath not  hearkened unto them, as Jehovah hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `The heart of Pharaoh hath  been hard, he hath refused to send the people away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>go unto Pharaoh in the morning, lo, he is going out to the  water, and thou hast stood to meet him by the edge of the  River, and the rod which was turned to a serpent thou dost take  in thy hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and thou hast said unto him: Jehovah, God of the Hebrews,  hath sent me unto thee, saying, Send My people away, and they  serve Me in the wilderness;
