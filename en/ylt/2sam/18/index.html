and if  half of us die, they do not set [their] heart unto us -- for now  like us [are] ten thousand; and now, better that thou be to us  from the city for an helper.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king saith unto them, `That which is good in your  eyes I do;` and the king standeth at the side of the gate, and  all the people have gone out by hundreds and by thousands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the king chargeth Joab, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying,  `Gently -- for me, for the youth, for Absalom;` and all the  people heard in the king`s charging all the heads concerning  Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the people goeth out into the field to meet Israel, and  the battle is in a forest of Ephraim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and smitten there are the people of Israel before the  servants of David, and the smiting there is great on that  day -- twenty thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the battle is there scattered over the face of all the  land, and the forest multiplieth to devour among the people  more than those whom the sword hath devoured in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Absalom meeteth before the servants of David, and  Absalom is riding on the mule, and the mule cometh in under an  entangled bough of the great oak, and his head taketh hold on  the oak, and he is placed between the heavens and the earth,  and the mule that [is] under him hath passed on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And one man seeth, and declareth to Joab, and saith, `Lo,  I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Joab saith to the man who is declaring [it] to him,  `And lo, thou hast seen -- and wherefore didst thou not smite him  there to the earth -- and on me to give to thee ten silverlings  and one girdle?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man saith unto Joab, `Yea, though I am weighing on  my hand a thousand silverlings, I do not put forth my hand unto  the son of the king;

for Jehovah hath  delivered thee to-day out of the hand of all those rising up  against thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the king saith unto the Cushite, `Peace to the  youth -- to Absalom?` And the Cushite saith, `Let them be -- as the  youth -- the enemies of my lord the king, and all who have risen  up against thee for evil.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king trembleth, and goeth up on the upper chamber  of the gate, and weepeth, and thus he hath said in his going,  `My son! Absalom my son; my son Absalom; oh that I had died for  thee, Absalom, my son, my son.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
