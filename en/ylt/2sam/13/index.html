dost thou not declare to me?` And Amnon  saith to him, `Tamar -- sister of Absalom my brother -- I am  loving.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jonadab saith to him, `Lie down on thy couch, and feign  thyself sick, and thy father hath come in to see thee, and thou  hast said unto him, `Let, I pray thee, Tamar my sister come in  and give me bread to eat; and she hath made the food before  mine eyes so that I see [it], and have eaten from her hand.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Amnon lieth down, and feigneth himself sick, and the  king cometh in to see him, and Amnon saith unto the king, `Let,  I pray thee, Tamar my sister come, and she maketh before mine  eyes two cakes, and I eat from her hand.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David sendeth unto Tamar, to the house, saying, `Go, I  pray thee, to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make for him  food.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Tamar goeth to the house of Amnon her brother, and he  is lying down, and she taketh the dough, and kneadeth, and  maketh cakes before his eyes, and cooketh the cakes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and taketh the frying-pan, and poureth out before him, and  he refuseth to eat, and Amnon saith, `Take ye out every one  from me;` and they go out every one from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Amnon saith unto Tamar, `Bring the food into the inner  chamber, and I eat from thy hand;` and Tamar taketh the cakes  that she hath made, and bringeth in to Amnon her brother, into  the inner chamber,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and she bringeth nigh unto him to eat, and he layeth hold  on her, and saith to her, `Come, lie with me, my sister.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she saith to him, `Nay, my brother, do not humble me,  for it is not done so in Israel; do not this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I -- whither do I cause my reproach to go? and  thou -- thou art as one of the fools in Israel; and now, speak, I  pray thee, unto the king; for he doth not withhold me from  thee.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he hath not been willing to hearken to her voice, and  is stronger than she, and humbleth her, and lieth with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Amnon hateth her -- a very great hatred -- that greater  [is] the hatred with which he hath hated her than the love with  which he loved her, and Amnon saith to her, `Rise, go.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she saith to him, `Because of the circumstances this  evil is greater than the other that thou hast done with me -- to  send me away;` and he hath not been willing to hearken to her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and calleth his young man, his servant, and saith, `Send  away, I pray thee, this one from me without, and bolt the door  after her;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>-- and upon her [is] a long coat, for such upper robes do  daughters of the king who [are] virgins put on, -- and his  servant taketh her out without, and hath bolted the door after  her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tamar taketh ashes for her head, and the long coat  that [is] on her she hath rent, and putteth her hand on her  head, and goeth, going on and crying;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Absalom her brother saith unto her, `Hath Amnon thy  brother been with thee?

be strong, yea,  become sons of valour.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the young men of Absalom do to Amnon as Absalom  commanded, and rise do all the sons of the king, and they ride,  each on his mule, and flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it cometh to pass -- they [are] in the way -- and the  report hath come unto David, saying, `Absalom hath smitten all  the sons of the king, and there is not left of them one;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the king riseth, and rendeth his garments, and lieth  on the earth, and all his servants are standing by [with] rent  garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonadab son of Shimeah, David`s brother, answereth and  saith, `Let not my lord say, The whole of the young men, the  sons of the king, they have put to death; for Amnon alone [is]  dead, for by the command of Absalom it hath been appointed from  the day of his humbling Tamar his sister;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and now, let not my lord the king lay unto his heart the  word, saying, All the sons of the king have died, for Amnon  alone [is] dead.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Absalom fleeth, and the young man who is watching  lifteth up his eyes and looketh, and lo, much people are coming  by the way behind him, on the side of the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jonadab saith unto the king, `Lo, the sons of the king  have come; as the word of thy servant, so it hath been.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it cometh to pass at his finishing to speak, that lo,  the sons of the king have come, and they lift up their voice,  and weep, and also the king and all his servants have wept -- a  very great weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Absalom hath fled, and goeth unto Talmai, son of  Ammihud, king of Geshur, and [David] mourneth for his son all  the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Absalom hath fled, and goeth to Geshur, and is there  three years;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and [the soul of] king David determineth to go out unto  Absalom, for he hath been comforted for Amnon, for [he is]  dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
