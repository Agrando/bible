you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ye shall put nothinge vnto the worde which I commaunde you nether doo ought there from, that ye maye kepe the commaundmentes off the Lorde youre God which I commaunde you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Youre eyes haue sene what the Lorde dyd vnto Baal Peor: for al the men that folowed Baal Peor, the Lorde youre God hath destroyed from amoge you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But ye that claue vnto the Lorde youre God, are alyue euery one of you this daye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Beholde, I

<span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Take hede to thy selfe therfore only ad kepe thy soule diligently, that thou forgett not the thinges which thyne eyes haue sene and that they departe not out of thyne harte, all the dayes of thine life: but teach them thy sonnes, ad thy sonnes sonnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The daye that I stode before the Lorde youre god in Horeb, whe he sayed vnto me, gather me the people together, that I maye make them heare my wordes that they maye lerne to fere me as longe as thei lyue vppon the erth and that they maye teache their childern:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>ye came ad stode also vnder the hyll ad the hyll burnt with fire: euen vnto the myddes of heaue, ad there was darcknesse, clowdes ad

name="15">15</a>Take hede vnto youre selues diligently as pertayninge vnto youre soules, for ye sawe no maner of ymage the daye when the Lorde spake vnto you in Horeb out of the fire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest ye marre youre selues and make you grauen ymages after what soeuer likenesse it be: whether after the likenesse of ma or woma</span> <span class="verse"><a

mone and the starres and what soeuer is contayned in heauen, shuldest be disceaued and shuldest bow thi selfe vnto them ad serue the thinges which the Lorde thy God hath distributed vnto all nacions that are vnder al quarters of heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Lorde toke you and broughte you out of the yernen fornace of Egipte, to be vnto him a people of enheritaunce, as it is come to passe this daye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Forthermoare, the Lorde was angrye with me for youre sakes and sware, that I shulde not goo ouer Iordane

God which he made with you, and that ye make you no grauen ymage of what soeuer it be that the Lorde thi God hath forbidden the.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the Lorde thi God is a cosuminge fyre, and a gelouse God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yf after thou hast gotten childern and childerns childern and hast dwelt longe in the londe, ye shall marre youre selues and make grauen ymages after the liknesse of what so euer it be, and shall worke wekednesse in the syghte of the Lorde thy God, to prouoke him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I call heauen and erth to recorde vnto you this daye, that ye shall shortely peressh from of the londe whether ye goo ouer Iordayne to possesse it: Ye shall not prolonge youre dayes therin, but shall shortly be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Lorde shall scater you amonge nacions, and ye shalbe lefte few in numbre amonge the people whother the Lorde shall brynge you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and there ye shall serue goddes which are the workes of mans hande, wod and stone which nether se nor heare nor eate nor smell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Neuer the later ye shall seke the Lorde youre God euen there, and shalt fynde him yf thou seke him with all thine herte and with all thy soule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In thi tribulacion and when all these thinges are come apon the, euen in the later dayes, thou shalt turne vnto the Lorde thy God, and shalt herken vnto his voyce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For the Lorde thy God is a pitiefull God: he will not forsake the nether destroye the, nor forgett the appoyntmet made with thy fathers which he sware vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For axe I praye the of the dayes that are past which were before the, sence the daye that God created man vppon the erth and from the one syde of heauen vnto the other whether any thinge hath bene lyke vnto this greate thinge or whether any soche thinge hath bene herde as it is,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>that a nacion hath herde the voyce of God speakinge out of fyre as thou hast herde, and yet lyued?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>ether whether God assayed to goo and take him a people from amonge nacions, thorow temptacions and sygnes and wonders and thorow warre and with a mightie hande and a stretched out arme and wyth myghtye terreble sightes, acordynge vnto all that the Lorde youre God dyd vnto you in Egipte before youre eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Vnto the it was shewed, that thou myghtest knowe, how that the Lorde he is God and that there is none but he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Out of heauen he made the heare his voyce to nurter the, and vppon erth he shewed the his greate fyre, and thou hardest his wordes out of the fyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And because he loued thy fathers, therfore he chose their seed after them and broughte the out with his presence and with his myghtye power of Egipte:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>to thrust out nations greater ad myghtyer then thou before the, to bringe the in and to geue the their londe to enheritaunce: as it is come to passe this daye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Vnderstonde therfore this daye and turne it to thine herte, that the Lorde he is God in heauen aboue and vppon the erth beneth there is no moo:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>kepe therfore his ordynaunces, and his commaundmentes which I commaunde the this daye, that it maye goo well with the and with thi childern after the and that thou mayst prolonge thy dayes vppon the erth which the Lorde thi God geueth the for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Moses seuered .iij. cities on the other syde
