But they vnderstode not what thinges they were which he spake vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then sayde Iesus vnto them agayne. Verely verely I saye vnto you: I am the dore of the shepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All even as many as came before me are theves and robbers: but the shepe dyd not heare them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the dore: by me yf eny man enter in he shalbe safe and shall goo in and out and fynde pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thefe cometh not but forto steale kyll and destroye. I am come that they myght have lyfe and have it more aboundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am ye good shepeheerd. The good shepeheerd geveth his lyfe for ye shepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>An heyred servaut which is not ye shepeherd nether ye shepe are his awne seith the wolfe comynge and leveth the shepe and flyeth and the wolfe catcheth them and scattereth ye shepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The heyred servaut flyeth because he is an heyred servaunt and careth not for the shepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am that good shepeheerd and knowe myne and am knowe of myne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As my father knoweth me: even so knowe I my father. And I geve my lyfe for the shepe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and other shepe I have which are not of this folde. Them also must I bringe that they maye heare my voyce and that ther maye be one flocke and one shepeherde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therfore doth my father love me because I put my lyfe from me that I myght take it agayne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No man taketh it from me: but I put it awaye of my selfe. I have power to put it from me and have power to take it agayne: This comaundment have I receaved of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ther was a dissencion agayne amoge the Iewes for these sayinges</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and many of them sayd. He hath the devyll and is mad: why heare ye him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Other sayde these are not the wordes of him that hath the devyll. Can the devyll open the eyes of the blynde?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it was at Ierusalem ye feaste of the dedicacion and it was wynter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Iesus walked in Salomons porche.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then came the Iewes rounde aboute him and sayde vnto him: How longe dost thou make vs doute? Yf thou be Christ tell vs playnly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Iesus answered them: I tolde you and ye beleve not. The workes yt I do in my fathers name they beare witnes of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But ye beleve not because ye are not of my shepe.

For thy good workes sake we stone ye not: but for thy blasphemy and because that thou beinge a man makest thy selfe God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Iesus answered them: Is it not written in youre lawe: I saye ye are goddes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called the goddes vnto whom the worde of God was spoken (and the scripture can not be broken)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>saye ye then to him whom the father hath sainctified and sent into the worlde thou blasphemest because I sayd I am the sonne of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not the workes of my father beleve me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do though ye beleve not me yet beleve the workes that ye maye knowe and beleve that the father is in me and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Agayne they went aboute to take him: but he escaped out of their hondes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and went awaye agayne beyonde Iordan into the place where Iohn before had baptised and there aboode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many resorted vnto him and sayd. Iohn dyd no miracle: but all thinges that Iohn spake of this man are true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many beleved on him theare.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
