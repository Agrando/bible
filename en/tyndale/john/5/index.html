Whosoever then fyrst after the steringe of the water stepped in was made whoale of what soever disease he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a certayne ma was theare which had bene diseased .xxxviii. yeares</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>. When Iesus sawe him lye and knewe that he now longe tyme had bene diseased he sayde vnto him. Wilt thou be made whoale?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The sicke answered him: Syr I have no man whe the water is troubled to put me into the pole. But in the meane tyme whill I am about to come another steppeth doune before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Iesus sayde vnto him: ryse take vp thy beed and walke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And immediatly the man was made whole and toke vp his beed and went. And the same daye was the Saboth daye</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>. The Iewes therfore sayde vnto him that was made whole. It is ye Saboth daye it is not laufull for the to cary thy beed</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>. He answered them: he that made me whole sayde vnto me: take vp thy beed and get the hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then axed they him: what man is that which sayde vnto the take vp thy beed and walke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he yt was healed wist not who it was. For Iesus had gotte him selfe awaye be cause yt ther was preace of people in ye place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after that Iesus founde him in the teple and sayd vnto him: beholde thou arte made whole synne no moore lest a worsse thinge happe vnto the.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man departed and tolde ye Iewes that yt was Iesus whiche had made him whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And therfore the Iewes dyd persecute Iesus and sought the meanes to slee him because he had done these thinges on the Saboth daye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Iesus answered them: my father worketh hidder to and I worke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therfore the Iewes sought the moare to kill him not only because he had broken the Saboth: but sayde also that God was his father and made him selfe equall with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then answered Iesus and sayde vnto them: verely verely I saye vnto you: the sonne can do no thinge of him selfe but that he seeth ye father do. For whatsoever he doeth yt doeth the sonne also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the father loveth ye sonne and sheweth him all thinges whatsoever he him selfe doeth. And he will shewe him greter workes then these because ye shoulde marvayle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For lykwyse as the father rayseth vp ye deed and quickeneth them even so the sonne quyckeneth whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nether iudgeth ye father eny ma: but hath comitted all iudgemet vnto the sonne</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because that all men shuld honoure the sonne eve as they honoure the father. He that honoureth not ye sonne the same honoureth not the father which hath sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Verely verely I saye vnto you: He that heareth my wordes and beleveth on him that sent me hath everlastinge lyfe and shall not come into damnacion: but is scaped fro deth vnto lyfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Verely verely I saye vnto you: the tyme shall come and now is when the deed shall heare the voyce of the sonne of God. And they yt heare shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the father hath life in him silfe: so lyke wyse hath he geven to ye sonne to have lyfe in him silfe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and hath geven him power also to iudge in that he is the sonne of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Marvayle not at this ye houre shall come in the which all yt are in the graves shall heare his voice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and shall come forthe: they that have done good vnto the resurreccion of lyfe: and they that have done evyll vnto the resurreccion of dampnacion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can of myne awne selfe do nothinge at all. As I heare I iudge and my iudgemet is iust because I seke not myne awne will but the will of ye father which hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yf I beare witnes of my selfe my witnes is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Ther is a nother that beareth witnes of me and I am sure that the witnes whiche he beareth of me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ye sent vnto Iohn and he bare witnes vnto the truthe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I receave not the recorde of man. Neverthelesse these thinges I saye that ye might be safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a burninge and a shyninge light and ye wolde for a season have reioysed in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have greater witnes then the witnes of Iohn. For ye workes which ye father hath geve me to fynisshe: the same workes which I do beare witnes of me that ye father sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the father him silfe which hath sent me beareth witnes of me. Ye have not hearde his voyce at eny tyme nor ye have sene his shape:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>therto his wordes have ye not abydinge in you. For whome he hath sent: him ye beleve not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Searche the scriptures for in them ye thinke ye have eternall lyfe: and they are they which testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And yet will ye not come to me that ye might have lyfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I receave not prayse of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I knowe you that ye have not the love of God in you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I am come in my fathers name and ye receave me not. Yf another shall come in his awne name him will ye receave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can ye beleve which receave honoure one of another and seke not the honoure that commeth of God only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Doo not thinke that I wyll accuse you to my father. Ther is one that accuseth you eve Moses in whom ye trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For had ye beleved Moses ye wold have beleved me: for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But now ye beleve not his writinge: how shall ye beleve my wordes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
