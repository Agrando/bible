Yf I be not an Apostle vnto other yet am I vnto you. For the seale of myne Apostleshippe are ye in the lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Myne answer to them that axe me is this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have we not power to eate and to drynke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ether have we not power to leade about a sister to wyfe as wel as other Apostles and as the brethren of the lorde and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ether only I and Barnabas have not power this to do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>who goeth a warfare eny tyme at his awne cost? who planteth a vynearde and eateth not of the frute?
