He will come and destroye ye tenauntes and let out the vyneyarde to other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have ye not redde this scripture? The stoone which ye bylders dyd refuse is made ye chefe stoone in ye corner:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>this was done of ye Lorde and is mervelous in oure eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went about to take him but they feared the people.

Heare Israel: The Lorde God is one Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou shalt love the Lorde thy God with all thy hert and with all thy soule and with all thy mynde and with all thy strength. This is the fyrste commaundement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the seconde is lyke vnto this: Thou shalt love thy neghbour as thy silfe. Ther is none other commaundement greater then these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the Scribe sayde vnto him: well master thou hast sayd ye truthe that ther ys one God and that ther is none but he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And to love him with all the herte and with all the mynde and with all the soule and with all the stregth: and to love a mans neghbour as him silfe ys a greater thinge then all burntofferings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Iesus sawe that he answered discretly he sayde vnto him: Thou arte not farre from the kyngdome of God. And no man after that durst axe him eny questio.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Iesus answered and sayde teachynge in the temple: how saye the Scribes yt Christ is the sonne of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for David him selfe inspyred with the holy goost sayde: The Lorde sayde to my Lorde syt on my right honde tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then David hym silfe calleth him Lorde: and by what meanes is he then his sonne? And moche people hearde him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he sayde vnto them in his doctrine: beware of the Scribes which love to goo in longe clothinge: and love salutacions in ye market places</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the chefe seates in the synagoges and to syt in the vppermost roumes at feastes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and devoure widowes houses and that vnder coloure of longe prayinge. These shall receave greater dampnacion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Iesus sat over agaynst the treasury and behelde how the people put money in to the treasury. And many that were ryche cast in moch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And ther cam a certayne povre widowe and she threwe in two mytes which make a farthynge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he called vnto him his disciples and sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you that this pover widowe hath cast moare in then all they which have caste into the treasury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For they all dyd cast in of their superfluyte: but she of her poverte dyd cast in all that she had eve all her livynge.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
