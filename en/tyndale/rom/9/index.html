To whom pertayneth the adopcion and the glorie and the covenauntes and the law that was geven and the service of God and the promyses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>whose also are the fathers and they of whome (as concernynge the flesshe) Christ came which is God over all thinges blessed for ever Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I speake not these thinges as though the wordes of god had take none effecte. For they are not all Israelites which came of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>nether are they all chyldren strayght waye because they are the seed of Abraham. But in Isaac shall thy seede be called:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>that is to saye they which are the chyldren of the flesshe are not the chyldren of god. But the chyldren of promes are counted the seede.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is a worde of promes aboute this tyme will I come and Sara shall have a sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nether was it so wt her only: but also when Rebecca was with chylde by one I meane by oure father Isaac</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>yeer the chyldren were borne when they had nether done good nether bad: that the purpose of God which is by election myght stonde</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was sayde vnto her not by the reason of workes but by grace of ye caller: the elder shall serve the yonger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written: Iacob he loved but Esau he hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we saye then? is there eny vnrightewesses with God? God forbyd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he sayth to Moses: I will shewe mercye to who I shewe mercy: and will have compassion on whom I have copassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So lieth it not then in a mans will or cunnynge but in ye mercye of god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the scripture sayth vnto Pharao: Even for this same purpose have I stered ye vp to shewe my power on ye and that my name myght be declared thorow out all the worlde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So hath he mercye on whom he will and whom he will he maketh hearde herted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt saye then vnto me: why then blameth he vs yet? For who can resist his will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But o man what arte thou which disputest with God? Shall the worke saye to the workeman: why hast thou made me on this fassion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hath not the potter power over the claye even of the same lompe to make one vessell vnto honoure and a nother vnto dishonoure?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even so God willynge to shewe his wrath and to make his power knowen suffered with longe pacience the vessels of wrath ordeyned to damnacion</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that he myght declare ye ryches of his glory on the vessels of mercye which he had prepayred vnto glorie:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>that is to saye vs which he called not of the Iewes only but also of ye gentyls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he sayth in Osee: I will call them my people which were not my people: and her beloved which was not beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall come to passe in the place where it was sayd vnto them ye are not my people: that there shalbe called the chyldren of the lyvynge God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Esaias cryeth concernynge Israel though the nomber of the chyldren of Israel be as the sonde of the see yet shall a remnaut be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He finyssheth the worde verely and maketh it short in ryghtwesses. For a short worde will god make on erth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as Esaias sayd before: Except the Lorde of sabaoth had left us seede we had bene made as Zodoma and had bene lykened to Gomorra.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we saye then? We saye that the gentyls which followed not rightewesnes have overtaken rightewesnes: I meane the rightewesnes which cometh of fayth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel which folowed the lawe of rightewesnes coulde not attayne vnto ye lawe of rightewesnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And wherfore? Because they sought it not by fath: but as it were by the workes of the lawe. For they have stombled at the stomblynge stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As it is written: Beholde I put in Syon a stomblynge stone and a rocke which shall make men faule. And none yt beleve on him shalbe a shamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
