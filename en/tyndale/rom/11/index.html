God forbyd. For even I verely am an Israelite of the seed of Abraha and of ye tribe of Beniamin</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>god hath not cast awaye his people which he knew before. Ether wote ye not what the scripture sayth by the mouth of Helias how he maketh intercession to god agaynst Israel sayinge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lorde they have kylled thy prophetes and dygged doune thyn alters: and I am lefte only and they seke my lyfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what sayth the answer of god to him agayne? I have reserved vnto me seven thousande men which have not bowed the knee to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so at this tyme ys ther a remnanaunt lefte thorow the eleccion of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yf it be of grace the is it not of workes.
