But to be spiritually mynded is lyfe and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because that the flesshly mynde is emnyte agaynst God: for it is not obedient to the lawe of God nether can be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So then they yt are geven to the flesshe canot please God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But ye are not geven to the flesshe but to the sprete: yf so be that ye sprite of God dwell in you.
