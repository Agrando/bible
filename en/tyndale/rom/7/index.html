Yf the man be deed she is lowsed from the lawe of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So then yf whill the man liveth she couple her selfe with another man she shalbe counted a wedlocke breaker. But yf the man be deed she is fre fro the lawe: so that she is no wedlocke breaker though she couple her selfe with another man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Even so ye my brethren are deed concerninge the lawe by the body of Christ yt ye shuld be coupled to another (I meane to him that is rysen agayne fro deeth) that we shuld bringe forth frute vnto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For when we were in the flesshe the lustes of synne which were stered vppe by ye lawe raygned in oure membres to bringe forth frute vnto deeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now are we delivered fro the lawe and deed fro that whervnto we werein bondage that we shuld serve in a newe conversacion of ye sprete and not in ye olde conversacion of the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we saye then? is ye lawe synne? God forbid: but I knewe not what synne meant but by the lawe. For I had not knowne what lust had meant excepte the lawe had sayde thou shalt not lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But synne toke an occasion by the meanes of the commaundement and wrought in me all manner of concupiscece. For with out the lawe synne was deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I once lived with out lawe. But when the commaundement came synne revyved and I was deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the very same comaundement which was ordeyned vnto lyfe was founde to be vnto me an occasion of deeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For synne toke occasion by the meanes of the comaundement and so disceaved me and by the selfe commaundement slewe we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherfore the lawe is holy and the commaundement holy iust and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Was that then which is good made deeth vnto me? God forbyd. Naye synne was deeth vnto me that it myght appere how that synne by the meanes of that which is good had wrought deeth in me: that synne which is vnder the commandemet myght be out of measure synfull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we knowe that the lawe is spirituall: but I am carnall solde vnder synne</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>because I wote not what I doo. For what I wold that do I not: but what I hate that do I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yf I do now that which I wolde not I graute to the lawe that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then nowe it is not I that do it but synne that dwelleth in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I knowe that in me (that is to saye in my flesshe) dwelleth no good thinge. To will is present with me: but I fynde no meanes to performe that which is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I doo not yt good thinge which I wold: but that evill do I which I wolde not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Finally yf I do that I wolde not then is it not I that doo it but synne that dwelleth in me doeth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I fynde then by the lawe that when I wolde do good evyll is present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I delite in the lawe of God concerninge the inner man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I se another lawe in my membres rebellinge agaynst the lawe of my mynde and subduynge me vnto the lawe of synne which is in my membres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O wretched man yt I am: who shall delyver me fro this body of deeth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I thanke God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde.
