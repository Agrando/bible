For we know that tribulacion bringeth pacience</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>pacience bringeth experience experience bringeth hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And hope maketh not ashamed for the love of God is sheed abrod in oure hertes by the holy goost which is geven vnto vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For when we were yet weake accordynge to ye tyme: Christ dyed for vs which were vngodly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet scace will eny man dye for a rightewes man.
