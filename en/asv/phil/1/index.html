only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if to live in the flesh, --[if] this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
