And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [them that are] no gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also [set they] in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
