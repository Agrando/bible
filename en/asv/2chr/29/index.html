And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now they began on the first [day] of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within [the palace], and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded [that] the burnt-offering and the sin-offering [should be made] for all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king`s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all the assembly worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this [continued] until the burnt-offering was finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart [brought] burnt-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
