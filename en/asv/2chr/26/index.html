And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over the king`s house, judging the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
