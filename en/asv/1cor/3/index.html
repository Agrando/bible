Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are God`s fellow-workers: ye are God`s husbandry, God`s building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>each man`s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man`s work of what sort it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man`s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man`s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and ye are Christ`s; and Christ is God`s.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
