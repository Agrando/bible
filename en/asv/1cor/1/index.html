was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God`s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, [yea] and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that no flesh should glory before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
