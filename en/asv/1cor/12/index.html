If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they were all one member, where were the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now they are many members, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those [parts] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whereas our comely [parts] have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or [one] member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, [divers] kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all [workers of] miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But desire earnestly the greater gifts.
