Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My defence to them that examine me is this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have we no right to eat and to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, [to thresh] in hope of partaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others partake of [this] right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat [of] the things of the temple, [and] they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for [it were] good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For though I was free from all [men,] I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I do all things for the gospel`s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they [do it] to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
