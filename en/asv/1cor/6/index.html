What, cannot there be [found] among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
