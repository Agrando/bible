Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But unto the married I give charge, [yea] not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use [it] rather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord`s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ`s bondservant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, [namely,] that it is good for a man to be as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and is divided. [So] also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter], if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter], shall do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then both he that giveth his own virgin [daughter] in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
