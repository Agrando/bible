[even] that which hath been done long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wise man`s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days are [but] sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is nothing better for a man [than] that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For to the man that pleaseth him [God] giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
