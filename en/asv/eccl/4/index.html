This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, [saith he], do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm [alone]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
