for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything [that shall be] after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth [his life] in his evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I turned about, and my heart [was set] to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason [of things], and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, [and] whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, [laying] one thing to another, to find out the account;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
