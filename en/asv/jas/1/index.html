But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he that looketh into the perfect law, the [law] of liberty, and [so] continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this man`s religion is vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
