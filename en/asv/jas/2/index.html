Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one [point], he is become guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment [is] without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from [thy] works, and I by my works will show thee [my] faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
