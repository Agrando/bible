Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the hire of the laborers who mowed your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous [one]; he doth not resist you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and latter rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be ye also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Murmur not, brethren, one against another, that ye be not judged: behold, the judge standeth before the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take, brethren, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spake in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, we call them blessed that endured: ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.
