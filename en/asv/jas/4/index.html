[come they] not hence, [even] of your pleasures that war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend [it] in your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore [the scripture] saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One [only] is the lawgiver and judge, [even] he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
