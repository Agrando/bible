If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now if we put the horses` bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] a restless evil, [it is] full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet [water] and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt water yield sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not [a wisdom] that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
