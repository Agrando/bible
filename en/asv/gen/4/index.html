And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother`s keeper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother`s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother`s blood from thy hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his brother`s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, [said she], God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
