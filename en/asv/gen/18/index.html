And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, [and] well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty`s sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty`s sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten`s sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
