And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph`s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph`s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they came near to the steward of Joseph`s house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man`s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the man brought the men into Joseph`s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they made ready the present against Joseph`s coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother`s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin`s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
