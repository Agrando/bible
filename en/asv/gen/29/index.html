For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well`s mouth was great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And thither were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the well`s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well`s mouth in its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well`s mouth. Then we water the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father`s sheep. For she kept them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother`s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother`s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well`s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother`s brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father`s brother, and that he was Rebekah`s son. And she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister`s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Leah`s eyes were tender. But Rachel was beautiful and well favored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. For now my husband will love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this [son] also. And she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again, and bare a son. And she said, This time will I praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
