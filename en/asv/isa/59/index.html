And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed`s seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
