Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that make a man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
