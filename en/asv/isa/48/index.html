I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou didst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For my name`s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do it; for how should [my name] be profaned? and my glory will I not give to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; who among them hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah loveth shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, saith Jehovah, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
