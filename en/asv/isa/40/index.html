And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, [and] will gently lead those that have their young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The image, a workman hath cast [it], and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold, and casteth [for it] silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that is too impoverished for [such] an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a skilful workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have ye not known? have yet not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[It is] he that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that bringeth princes to nothing; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal [to him]? saith the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah, and the justice [due] to me is passed away from my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard?
