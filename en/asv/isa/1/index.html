the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,- I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
