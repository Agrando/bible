As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous man dealeth treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart fluttereth, horror hath affrighted me; the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he seeth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O thou my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Unto him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
