Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father`s house have sinned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
