And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he knew that he was of Herod`s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>the sun`s light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), [a man] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
