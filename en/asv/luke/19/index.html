Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, Go your way into the village over against [you]; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as he was now drawing nigh, [even] at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, Blessed [is] the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
