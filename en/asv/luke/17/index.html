And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after [them]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot`s wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose [his life] shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[There shall be two men in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body [is], thither will the eagles also be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
