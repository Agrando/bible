is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was parted from them about a stone`s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye [them] thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they seized him, and led him [away], and brought him into the high priest`s house. But Peter followed afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light [of the fire], and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art [one] of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men that held [Jesus] mocked him, and beat him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I ask [you], ye will not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
