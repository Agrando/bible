I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And calling to him each one of his lord`s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true [riches]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another`s, who will give you that which is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets [were] until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and desiring to be fed with the [crumbs] that fell from the rich man`s table; yea, even the dogs come and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham`s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father`s house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
