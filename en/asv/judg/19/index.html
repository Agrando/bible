and whence comest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am [now] going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that taketh me into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants: there is no want of anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not any such folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man`s house where her lord was, till it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
