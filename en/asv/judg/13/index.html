And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and [how] shall we do unto him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
