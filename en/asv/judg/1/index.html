So Simeon went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba); and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir.
