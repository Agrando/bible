And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened [them], and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
