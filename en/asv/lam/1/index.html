She is become as a widow, that was great among the nations! She that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her       cheeks; Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are       become her enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and       because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn       assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her       transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of       her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the       days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none       did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become       as an unclean thing; All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her       nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her       latter end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified       himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her       pleasant things: For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her       sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter       into thine assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the       soul: See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,       which is brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce       anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it       prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath       made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am       not able to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the       midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young       men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of       Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down       with water; Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort       her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are       round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his       commandment: Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought them food to refresh their souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is       troubled; My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that       thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they       shall be like unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let all their wickedness come before thee; And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my       transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
