Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah.
