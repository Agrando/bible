We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not abhor [us], for thy name`s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O Jehovah our God? therefore we will wait for thee; for thou hast made all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
