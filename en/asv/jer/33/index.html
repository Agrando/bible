For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that numbereth them, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is [the name] whereby she shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah did choose, he hath cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus saith Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night [stand] not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
