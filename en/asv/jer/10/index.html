Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure: not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
