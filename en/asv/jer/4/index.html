Woe unto us! for we are ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth evil from the hills of Ephraim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, [that] watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reacheth unto thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, [and] my curtains in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For my people are foolish, they know me not; they are sottish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, [and] before his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thus saith Jehovah, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Every city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou, when thou art made desolate, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlargest thine eyes with paint, in vain dost thou make thyself fair; [thy] lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath, that spreadeth her hands, [saying], Woe is me now! for my soul fainteth before the murderers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
