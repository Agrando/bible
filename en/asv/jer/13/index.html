shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
