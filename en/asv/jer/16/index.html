And I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled mine inheritance with their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Jehovah, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nought but lies, [even] vanity and things wherein there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make unto himself gods, which yet are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
