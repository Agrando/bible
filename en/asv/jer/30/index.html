thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called thee an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob`s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
