Then said Jeremiah unto him, Jehovah hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O Jehovah, thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot [contain].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, [say] all my familiar friends, they that watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehovah is with me as a mighty one [and] a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, O Jehovah of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing unto Jehovah, praise ye Jehovah; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child is born unto thee; making him very glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
