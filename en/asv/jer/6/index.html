Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk [therein].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I set watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have made thee a trier [and] a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Refuse silver shall men them, because Jehovah hath rejected them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
