and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son`s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith Jehovah, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that [nation] will I let remain in their own land, saith Jehovah; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I spake to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah`s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
