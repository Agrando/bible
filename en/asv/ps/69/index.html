For the waters are come in unto my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs       of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are       mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through       me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me,       O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; Shame hath covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my mother`s children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When I wept, [and chastened] my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They that sit in the gate talk of me; And [I am] the song of the drunkards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an       acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep       waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, Neither let the deep shallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto       me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And hide not thy face from thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: Mine adversaries are all before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of       heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, [let it become] a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour out thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of life, And not be written with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I am poor and sorrowful: Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it will please Jehovah better than an ox, [Or] a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The meek have seen it, and are glad: Ye that seek after God, let your heart live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For Jehovah heareth the needy, And despiseth not his prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moveth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; And they that love his name shall dwell therein.           Psalm 70  For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David; to bring to remembrance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
