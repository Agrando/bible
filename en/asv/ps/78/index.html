Will he provide flesh for his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, being merciful, forgave [their] iniquity, and       destroyed [them] not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They remember not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their       fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When God heard [this], he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary`s hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From following the ewes that have their young he brought       him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his       inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of       his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
