And is there knowledge in the Most High?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy       children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was [as] a beast before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My flesh and my heart faileth; [But] God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, [departing]       from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works.
