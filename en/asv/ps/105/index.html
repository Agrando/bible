Make known among the peoples his doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvelous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[The covenant] which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[Saying], Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in [chains of] iron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent Moses his servant, [And] Aaron whom he had chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their       kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He gave them hail for rain, [And] flaming fire in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places [like] a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he remembered his holy word, [And] Abraham his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he brought forth his people with joy, [And] his chosen with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.           Psalm 106</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
