Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me, And the light about me shall be night;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Even the darkness hideth not from thee, But the night shineth as the day: The darkness and the light are both alike [to thee].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For thou didst form my inward parts: Thou didst cover me in my mother`s womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and       wonderfully made: Wonderful are thy works; And that my soul knoweth right well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret, [And] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance; And in thy book they were all written, [Even] the days that were ordained [for me], When as yet there was none of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I should count them, they are more in number than       the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they speak against thee wickedly, And thine enemies take [thy name] in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I hate them with perfect hatred: They are become mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Search me, O God, and know my heart: Try me, and know my thoughts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And see if there be any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.
