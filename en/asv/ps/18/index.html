My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The cords of death compassed me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round       about him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the channels of waters appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all his ordinances were before me, And I put not away his statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was also perfect with him, And I kept myself from mine iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my       righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thou wilt light my lamp: Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For by thee I run upon a troop; And by my God do I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, besides our God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The God that girdeth me with strength, And maketh my way perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He maketh my feet like hinds` [feet]: And setteth me upon my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He teacheth my hands to war; So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy right hand hath holden me up, And thy gentleness hath made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I will smite them through, so that they shall not be       able to rise: They shall fall under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto       me, That I might cut off them that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They cried, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And subdueth peoples under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He rescueth me from mine enemies; Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among       the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.           Psalm 19  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
