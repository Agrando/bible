And let an adversary stand at his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let his days be few; [And] let another take his office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek [their bread] out of their desolate places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with       Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He clothed himself also with cursing as with his       garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth       himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy       name`s sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That they may know that this is thy hand; [That] thou, Jehovah, hast done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a       robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.           Psalm 110       A Psalm of David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
