For he is good; For his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let the redeemed of Jehovah say [so], Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth [them] from their destructions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the       depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits` end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied       greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh [him] families like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.
