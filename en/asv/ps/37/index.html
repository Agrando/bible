Dwell in the land, and feed on [his] faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the       light, And thy justice as the noon-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself, [it tendeth] only to evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not       be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their       bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bows shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is a little that the righteous hath Than the abundance of many wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; In smoke shall they consume away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man`s goings are established of Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; And his seed is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For Jehovah loveth justice, And forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell therein for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; For there is a [happy] end to the man of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together; The end of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them; He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they have taken refuge in him.           Psalm 38  A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
