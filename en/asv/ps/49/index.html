Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Their inward thought is, [that] their houses [shall       continue] for ever, [And] their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But man [being] in honor abideth not: He is like the beasts that perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This their way is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings.     Selah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, That there be no habitation for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me.     Selah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish.
