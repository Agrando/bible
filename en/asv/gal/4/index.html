Ye did me no wrong:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Howbeit the [son] by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the [son] by the freewoman [is born] through promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things contain an allegory: for these [women] are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath       the husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, so also it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
