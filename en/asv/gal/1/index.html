Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is not another [gospel] only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews` religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I advanced in the Jews` religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, [even] from my mother`s womb, and called me through his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord`s brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
