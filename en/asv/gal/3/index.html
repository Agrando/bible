Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all the nations be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man`s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; [and it was] ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one; but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that the law is become our tutor [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now faith that is come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one [man] in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if ye are Christ`s, then are ye Abraham`s seed, heirs according to promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
