In everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So although I wrote unto you, I [wrote] not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest unto you in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore we have been comforted: And in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
