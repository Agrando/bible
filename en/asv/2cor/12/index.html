Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ`s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except [it be] that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? [walked we] not in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, [are] for your edifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means [there should be] strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
