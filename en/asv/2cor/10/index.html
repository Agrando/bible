If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ`s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ`s, so also are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [are we] also in deed when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not glory beyond [our] measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>not glorying beyond [our] measure, [that is,] in other men`s labors; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto [further] abundance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, [and] not to glory in another`s province in regard of things ready to our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
