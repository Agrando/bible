from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father`s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year.
