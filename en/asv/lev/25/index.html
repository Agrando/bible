Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it;

for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if thy brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: [as] a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God;

of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger [or] sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger`s family;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>or his uncle, or his uncle`s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if he be not redeemed by these [means], then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
