and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies` land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies` lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
