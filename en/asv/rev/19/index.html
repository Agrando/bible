And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a voice came forth from the throne, saying,     Give praise to our God, all ye his servants, ye that fear him, the small and the great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying,     Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright [and] pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are true words of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell down before his feet to worship him.
