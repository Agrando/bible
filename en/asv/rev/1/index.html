And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.
