And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down [to sleep], in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli`s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, What is the thing that [Jehovah] hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
