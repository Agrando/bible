By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us.
