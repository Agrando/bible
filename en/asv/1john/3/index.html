For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And every one that hath this hope [set] on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[My] little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother`s righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whoso hath the world`s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[My] Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
