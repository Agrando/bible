As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and [so] shall ye be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father`s commandments, and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and [that] your joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and [that] your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I command you, that ye may love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before [it hated] you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all these things will they do unto you for my name`s sake, because they know not him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But [this cometh to pass], that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
