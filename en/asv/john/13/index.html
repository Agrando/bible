He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another`s feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, a servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>There was at the table reclining in Jesus` bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell [us] who it is of whom he speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus` breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, [the son] of Simon Iscariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow now; but thou shalt follow afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
