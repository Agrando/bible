And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of sin, because they believe not on me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, [these] shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare [it] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare [it] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Some] of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day ye shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and [yet] I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
