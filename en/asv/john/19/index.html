And [Pilate] saith unto them, Behold, the man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar`s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They therefore cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, [and] in Latin, [and] in Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother`s sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own [home].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high [day]), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There then because of the Jews` Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
