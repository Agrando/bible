He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am [he].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him [to be] Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and [yet] he opened mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
