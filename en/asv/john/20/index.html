She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and [that] he had said these things unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first [day] of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace [be] unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach [hither] thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
