Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, [saying], I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their       heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [it], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the glory [that is] of men more than the glory [that is] of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
