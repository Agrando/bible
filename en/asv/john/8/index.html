But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spake these things, many believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, [then] are ye truly my disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered unto him, We are Abraham`s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that ye are Abraham`s seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak the things which I have seen with [my] Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from [your] father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham`s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do ye not understand my speech? [Even] because ye cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
