Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And [his] brightness was as the light; He had rays [coming forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were [as] of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thy bow was made quite bare; The oaths to the tribes were a [sure] word.     Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou didst march though the land in indignation; Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck.     Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his       warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses, The heap of mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For though the fig-tree shall not flourish, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he maketh my feet like hinds` [feet], And will make me to walk upon my high places.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
