I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days` journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh`s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault it in thine own people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, [your] daily tasks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
