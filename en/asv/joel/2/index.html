let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off [their course].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but I will remove far off from you the northern [army], and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first [month].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
