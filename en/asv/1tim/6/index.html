These things teach and exhort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any man teacheth a different doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godliness with contentment is great gain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but having food and covering we shall be therewith content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they that are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I charge thee in the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>which in its own times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honor and power eternal.
