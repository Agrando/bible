God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom [his] father chasteneth not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they indeed for a few days chastened [us] as seemed good to them; but he for [our] profit, that [we] may be partakers of his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, [even the fruit] of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>looking carefully lest [there be] any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble [you], and thereby the many be defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest [there be] any fornication, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind [in his father,] though he sought is diligently with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For ye are not come unto [a mount] that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which [voice] they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and so fearful was the appearance, [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than [that of] Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned [them] on earth, much more [shall not] we [escape] who turn away from him that [warneth] from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this [word], Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
