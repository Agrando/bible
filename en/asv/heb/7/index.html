but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need [was there] that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And [what we say] is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for it is witnessed [of him,] Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And inasmuch as [it is] not without the taking of an oath</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the [sins] of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, [appointeth] a Son, perfected for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
