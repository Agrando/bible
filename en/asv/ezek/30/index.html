it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they shall know at I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis [shall have] adversaries in the day-time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these [cities] shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [month], in the seventh [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply [healing] medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong [arm], and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
