and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, [a day of] tumult, and not [of] joyful shouting, upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword: and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations [and] their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret [place]; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
