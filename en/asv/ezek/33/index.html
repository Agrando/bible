O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes unto your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor`s wife: and shall ye possess the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but do them not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this cometh to pass, (behold, it cometh,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
