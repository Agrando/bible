And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his companions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children`s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
