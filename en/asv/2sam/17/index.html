For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the woman took and spread the covering over the well`s mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom`s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab`s mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
