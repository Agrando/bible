And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom`s sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let her sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon`s house, and dress him food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon`s house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king`s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom`s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king`s sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king`s sons go with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon`s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king`s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king`s sons, and there is not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David`s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king`s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king`s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king`s sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king`s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And [the soul of] king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
