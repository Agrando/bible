Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel`s sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.
