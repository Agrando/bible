My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my       refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my distress I called upon Jehovah; Yea, I called unto my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry [came] into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from mine iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my       righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the afflicted people thou wilt save; But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them       down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah; And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For by thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God is my strong fortress; And he guideth the perfect in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He maketh his feet like hinds` [feet], And setteth me upon my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He teacheth my hands to war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy gentleness hath made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so       that they cannot arise: Yea, they are fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto       me, That I might cut off them that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them       abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my       people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And that bringeth down peoples under me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among       the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
