And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth.
