Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have all turned aside, they are together become       unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not, so much as one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and misery are in their ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the way of peace have they not known:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law [cometh] the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God set forth [to be] a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the showing, [I say], of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or is God [the God] of Jews only? is he not [the God] of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
