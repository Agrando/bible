but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises [given] unto the fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have therefore my glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was [already] named, that I might not build upon another man`s foundation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but now, I [say], I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it [to them] also to minister unto them in carnal things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and [that] my ministration which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
