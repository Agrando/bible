God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? that which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation [is come] unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if their fall, is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy [them that are] my flesh, and may save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if the casting away of them [is] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God`s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural [branches], be grafted into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers` sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him [be] the glory for ever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
