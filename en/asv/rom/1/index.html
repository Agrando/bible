Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And even as they refused to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
