Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike]. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord`s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ died and lived [again], that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother`s way, or an occasion of falling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Overthrow not for meat`s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [to do anything] whereby thy brother stumbleth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
