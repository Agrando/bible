Thus shalt thou do six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram`s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams` horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he caused the ark of Jehovah to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Jehovah, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the city seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Jehovah hath given you the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot`s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Rahab the harlot, and her father`s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
