And should a man full of talk be justified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine       iniquity deserveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It is high as heaven; what canst thou do?
