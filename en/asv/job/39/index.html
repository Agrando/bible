[Or] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open       field; They go forth, and return not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy       seed, And gather [the grain] of thy threshing-floor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; [But] are they the pinions and plumage of love?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were       not hers: Though her labor be in vain, [she is] without fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast thou given the horse [his] might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As oft as the trumpet [soundeth] he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, (And) stretcheth her wings toward the south?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
