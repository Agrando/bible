My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My words [shall utter] the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If thou canst, answer thou me; Set [thy words] in order before me, stand forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of [thy] words, [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, he findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for his enemy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; For God is greater than man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why dost thou strive against him, For that he giveth not account of any of his matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For God speaketh once, Yea twice, [though man] regardeth it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he openeth the ears of men, And sealeth their instruction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, And hide pride from man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He keepeth back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with continual strife in his bones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So that his life abhorreth bread, And his soul dainty food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If there be with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then [God] is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>His flesh shall be fresher than a child`s; He returneth to the days of his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth unto man his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life shall behold the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, [yea] thrice, with a man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If thou hast anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
