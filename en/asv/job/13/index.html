And it would be your wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He will surely reprove you If ye do secretly show partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How many are mine iniquities and sins?
