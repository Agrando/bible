Or who hath disposed the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he set his heart upon himself, [If] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous [and] mighty?-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[Him] that saith to a king, [Thou art] vile, [Or] to nobles, [Ye are] wicked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He breaketh in pieces mighty men [in ways] past finding       out, And setteth others in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether [it be done] unto a nation, or unto a man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For hath any said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest       it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
