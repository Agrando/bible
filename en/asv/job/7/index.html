And are not his days like the days of a hireling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My days are swifter than a weaver`s shuttle, And are spent without hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Oh remember that my life is a breath: Mine eye shall no more see good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou settest a watch over me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When I say, My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than [these] my bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I loathe [my life]; I would not live alway: Let me alone; for my days are vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, And try him every moment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How long wilt thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of       men? Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, So that I am a burden to myself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take       away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
