Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much elder than thy father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Are the consolations of God too small for thee, Even the word that is gentle toward thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes flash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>That against God thou turnest thy spirit, And lettest words go out of thy mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, A man that drinketh iniquity like water!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will show thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying], Where is it? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He runneth upon him with a [stiff] neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance       continue, Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of [God`s] mouth shall he go away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be green.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the company of the godless shall be barren, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their heart prepareth deceit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
