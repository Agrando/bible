Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My soul refuseth to touch [them]; They are as loathsome food to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is my strength the strength of stones?
