Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art       righteous? Or is it gain [to him], that thou makest thy ways perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Is it for thy fear [of him] that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[Saying], Surely they that did rise up against us are       cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And lay thou [thy] treasure in the dust, And [the gold of] Ophir among the stones of the brooks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear       thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be       established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they cast [thee] down, thou shalt say, [There is]       lifting up; And the humble person he will save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He will deliver [even] him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
