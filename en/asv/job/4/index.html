But who can withhold himself from speaking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not thy fear [of God] thy confidence, [And] the integrity of thy ways thy hope?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance       thereof; A form was before mine eyes: [There was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall mortal man be more just than God?
