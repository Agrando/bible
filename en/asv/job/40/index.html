I lay my hand upon my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wilt thou even annul my judgment?
