Mine eyes shall see [my desire] upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, [and] the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
