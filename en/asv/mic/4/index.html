For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see [our desire] upon Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto Jehovah, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
