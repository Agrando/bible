But a grievous word stirreth up anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The tongue of the wise uttereth knowledge aright; But the mouth of fools poureth out folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, Keeping watch upon the evil and the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A gentle tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A fool despiseth his father`s correction; But he that regardeth reproof getteth prudence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the house of the righteous is much treasure; But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; But the heart of the foolish [doeth] not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But the prayer of the upright is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The way of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the       way; [And] he that hateth reproof shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sheol and Abaddon are before Jehovah: How much more then the hearts of the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A scoffer loveth not to be reproved; He will not go unto the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance; But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh       knowledge; But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All the days of the afflicted are evil; But he that is of a cheerful heart [hath] a continual feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is little, with the fear of Jehovah, Than great treasure and trouble therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A wrathful man stirreth up contention; But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns; But the path of the upright is made a highway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish man despiseth his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom;  But a man of understanding maketh straight his going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed; But in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good is it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>To the wise the way of life [goeth] upward, That he may depart from Sheol beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehovah will root up the house of the proud; But he will establish the border of the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Evil devices are an abomination to Jehovah; But pleasant words [are] pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; But he that hateth bribes shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The heart of the righteous studieth to answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jehovah is far from the wicked; But he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart; [And] good tidings make the bones fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life Shall abide among the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul; But he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom; And before honor [goeth] humility.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
