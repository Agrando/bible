And my voice is to the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared       unto it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge [and] discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By me princes rule, And nobles, [even] all the judges of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Riches and honor are with me; [Yea], durable wealth and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then I was by him, [as] a master workman; And I was daily [his] delight, Rejoicing always before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore, [my] sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
