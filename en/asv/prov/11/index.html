But a just weight is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Riches profit not in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way; But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When a wicked man dieth, [his] expectation shall perish; And the hope of iniquity perisheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, And the wicked cometh in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbor; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When it goeth well with the righteous, the city       rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holdeth his peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth; But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; But he that hateth suretyship is secure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A gracious woman obtaineth honor; And violent men obtain riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The wicked earneth deceitful wages; But he that soweth righteousness [hath] a sure reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He that is stedfast in righteousness [shall attain] unto       life; And he that pursueth evil [doeth it] to his own death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to       Jehovah; But such as are perfect in [their] way are his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[Though] hand [join] in hand, the evil man shall not be       unpunished; But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[As] a ring of gold in a swine`s snout, [So is] a fair woman that is without discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The desire of the righteous is only good; [But] the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more; And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but [it       tendeth] only to want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The liberal soul shall be made fat; And he that watereth shall be watered also himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he that is wise winneth souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: How much more the wicked and the sinner!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
