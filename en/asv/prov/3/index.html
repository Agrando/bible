But let thy heart keep my commandments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth; Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of       silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto       her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give; When thou hast it by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Devise not evil against thy neighbor, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
