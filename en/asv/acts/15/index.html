and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of       old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they wrote [thus] by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after they had spent some time [there], they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, [and see] how they fare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
