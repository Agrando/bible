And she constrained us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one`s bands were loosed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the jailor reported the words to Paul, [saying], The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house] of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
