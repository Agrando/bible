They will certainly hear that thou art come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men that have a vow on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as touching the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
