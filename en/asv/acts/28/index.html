for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with [me]: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded [the matter,] testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this people`s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
