this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a Sabbath day`s journey off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas [the son] of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons [gathered] together, about a hundred and twenty),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Brethren, it was needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be made desolate, And let no man dwell therein:     and, His office let another take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
