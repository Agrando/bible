And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are very religious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>neither is he served by men`s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined [their] appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus Paul went out from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
