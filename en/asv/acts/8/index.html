And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For [from] many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was much joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles` hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, [here is] water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>[And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
