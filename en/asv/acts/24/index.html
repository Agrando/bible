and they informed the governor against Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: [and we would have judged him according to our law.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>[commanding his accusers to come before thee.] from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but [there were] certain Jews from Asia--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
