Eat, O friends; Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was asleep, but my heart waked: It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door], And my heart was moved for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands droppeth with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the bolt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The watchmen that go about the city found me, They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, That ye tell him, that I am sick from love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, That thou dost so adjure us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head is [as] the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, [and] black as a raven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, [and] fitly set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His cheeks are as a bed of spices, [As] banks of sweet herbs: His lips are [as] lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His hands are [as] rings of gold set with beryl: His body is [as] ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His legs are [as] pillars of marble, set upon sockets of       fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His mouth is most sweet; Yea, he is altogether lovely.
