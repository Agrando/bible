And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and it came to pass, as he sowed, some [seed] fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And other fell on the rocky [ground], where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower soweth the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky [places], who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, [and] not to be put on the stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was [anything] made secret, but that it should come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
