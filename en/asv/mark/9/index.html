And he said, From a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and [the boy] became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, [How is it] that we could not cast it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who [was] the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For he that is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ`s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>[where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>[where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For every one shall be salted with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
