And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused him of many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was one called Barabbas, [lying] bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the multitude went up and began to ask him [to do] as he was wont to do unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go [with them], that he might bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was reckoned with transgressors.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save thyself, and come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him] among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe.
