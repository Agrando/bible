And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And every evening he went forth out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But should we say, From men--they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
