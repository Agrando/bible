But they held their peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he charged them much that they should not make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to cast out demons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Simon he surnamed Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
