And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
