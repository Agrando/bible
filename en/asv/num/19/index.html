her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whosoever toucheth a dead person, the body of a man that hath died, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering;
