and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah`s heave-offering to Aaron the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
