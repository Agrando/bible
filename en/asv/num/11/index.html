and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah`s hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah`s people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day`s journey on this side, and a day`s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
