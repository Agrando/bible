they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning;
