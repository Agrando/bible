And he went to a bare height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah put a word in Balaam`s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me?
