And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people honoreth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vain do they worship me, Teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children`s bread and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters` table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
