A city set on a hill cannot be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither do [men] light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but I say unto you, resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but I say unto you, love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others?] do not even the Gentiles the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
