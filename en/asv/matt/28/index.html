Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this come to the governor`s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, [and continueth] until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him, they worshipped [him]; but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
