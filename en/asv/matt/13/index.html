This is he that was sown by the way side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil [one];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter`s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
