Come ye forth to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For [it is] as [when] a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In like manner he also that [received] the two gained other two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord`s money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he also that [received] the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, [even] these least, ye did it unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
