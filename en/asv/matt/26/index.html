And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him [unto them.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now on the first [day] of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father`s kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, [yet] will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, [do] that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they that had taken Jesus led him away to [the house of] Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
