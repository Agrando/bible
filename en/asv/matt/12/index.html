And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus perceiving [it] withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and charged them that they should not make him known:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised reed shall he not break, And smoking flax shall he not quench, Till he send forth judgment unto victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or how can one enter into the house of the strong [man,] and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong [man]? and then he will spoil his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
