And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I [go], sir: and went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; This was from the Lord, And it is marvelous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
