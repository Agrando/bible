The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then came in all the king`s wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[Now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live forever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, [I say], thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then was Daniel brought in before the king.
