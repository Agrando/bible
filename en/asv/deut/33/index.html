With his hands he contended for himself; And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not       seen him; Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, Nor knew he his own children: For they have observed thy word, And keep thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thee, And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Bless, Jehovah, his substance, And accept the work of his hands: Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him; He covereth him all the day long, And he dwelleth between his shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land, For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the growth of the moons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness       thereof, And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush.

And he thrust out the enemy from before thee, And said, Destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Israel dwelleth in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; Yea, his heavens drop down dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Happy art thou, O Israel: Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
