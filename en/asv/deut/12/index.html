and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But unto the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and there ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then it shall come to pass that to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but in the place which Jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of thy hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but thou shalt eat them before Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest in thy land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to put his name there, be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which Jehovah hath given thee, as I have commanded thee;

and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thou shalt not do so unto Jehovah thy God: for every abomination to Jehovah, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
