and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>if thou shalt obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>to love Jehovah thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him;
