or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh [a man`s] life to pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When thou dost lend thy neighbor any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy sojourners that are in thy land within thy gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>in his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto Jehovah, and it be sin unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shalt not wrest the justice [due] to the sojourner, [or] to the fatherless, nor take the widow`s raiment to pledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When thou gatherest [the grapes of] thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
