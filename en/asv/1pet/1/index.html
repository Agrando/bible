on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that [should come] unto you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>searching what [time] or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angel desire to look into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in [the time of] your ignorance:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but like as he who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if ye call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each man`s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with precious blood, as of a lamb without spot, [even the blood] of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of times for your sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
