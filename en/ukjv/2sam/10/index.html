And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Think you that David does honour your father, that he has sent comforters unto you? has not David rather sent his servants unto you, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will come and help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seems him good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.

And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and stroke Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
