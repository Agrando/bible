Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and stone workers: and they built David an house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? will you deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into yours hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David came to Baalperazim, and David stroke them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them opposite to the mulberry trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let it be, when you hear the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself: for then shall the LORD go out before you, to strike the host of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and stroke the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
