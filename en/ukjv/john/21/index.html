They say unto him, We also go with you. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jesus says unto them, Children, have all of you any food? They answered him, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and all of you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus says unto them, Bring of the fish which all of you have now caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus says unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He says unto him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my lambs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He says to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He says unto him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He says unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Love you me? And he said unto him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus says unto him, Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter seeing him says to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus says unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? follow you me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then went this saying (o. logos) abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
