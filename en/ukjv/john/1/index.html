Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said they unto him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What says you of yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom all of you know not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day John sees Jesus coming unto him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit (o. pneuma) descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit (o. pneuma) descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Spirit. (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and says unto them, What seek all of you? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He says unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first finds his own brother Simon, and says unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and says unto him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip finds Nathanael, and says unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says unto him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael says unto him, Whence know you me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and says unto him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? you shall see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he says unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter all of you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
