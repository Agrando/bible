and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day all of you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As all of you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who also declared unto us your (o. agape) love in the (o. pneuma) Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that all of you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That all of you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Giving thanks unto the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his (o. agape) dear Son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and irreproachable in his sight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If all of you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which all of you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the (o. logos) word of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Unto which I also labour, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
