In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word (o. rhema) be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which in time past have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Since all of you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which toward you is not weak, but is mighty in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Examine yourselves, whether all of you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know all of you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except all of you be reprobates?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I trust that all of you shall know that we are not reprobates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now I pray to God that all of you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that all of you should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are glad, when we are weak, and all of you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love (o. agape) and peace shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Greet one another with an holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the saints salute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love (o. agape) of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, (o. pneuma) be with you all.
