An end, the end has come upon the four corners of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now is the end come upon you, and I will send mine anger upon you, and will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense upon you all yours abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And mine eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense your ways upon you, and yours abominations shall be in the midst of you: and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end has come, the end has come: it watches for you; behold, it has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The morning has come unto you, O you that dwell in the land: the time has come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon you, and accomplish mine anger upon you: and I will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense you for all yours abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense you according to your ways and yours abominations that are in the midst of you; and all of you shall know that I am the LORD that strikes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold the day, behold, it has come: the morning is gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be wailing for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time has come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is concerning the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goes to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
