When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he has done he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? says the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet all of you say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in them; for his iniquity that he has done shall he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet says the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby all of you have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will all of you die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live all of you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
