So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, behold a door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he unto me, Son of man, have you seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD sees us not; the LORD has forsaken the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said also unto me, Turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations that they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said he unto me, Have you seen this, O son of man? turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he said unto me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
