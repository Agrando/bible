As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said I unto them, Cast all of you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk all of you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that all of you may know that I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then I said unto them, What is the high place unto which all of you go? And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; Are all of you polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit all of you whoredom after their abominations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For when all of you offer your gifts, when all of you make your sons to pass through the fire, all of you pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that all of you say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein all of you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Like I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD; Go all of you, serve all of you every one his idols, and hereafter also, if all of you will not hearken unto me: but pollute all of you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein all of you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And all of you shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there shall all of you remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein all of you have been defiled; and all of you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that all of you have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all of you shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O all of you house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Does he not speak parables?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
