Return unto me, and I will return unto you, says the LORD of hosts. But all of you said, Wherein shall we return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will a man rob God? Yet all of you have robbed me. But all of you say, Wherein have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All of you are cursed with a curse: for all of you have robbed me, even this whole nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Bring all of you all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in mine house, and prove me now herewith, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all nations shall call you blessed: for all of you shall be a delightsome land, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your words have been stout against me, says the LORD.
