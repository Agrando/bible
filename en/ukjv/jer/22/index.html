This has been your manner from your youth, that you obeyed not my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall eat up all your pastors, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make your nest in the cedars, how gracious shall you be when pangs come upon you, the pain as of a woman in travail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As I live, says the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck you thence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will give you into the hand of them that seek your life, and into the hand of them whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will cast you out, and your mother that bare you, into another country, where all of you were not born; and there shall all of you die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land unto which they desire to return, thither shall they not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus says the LORD, Write all of you this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
