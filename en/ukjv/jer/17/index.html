let it come now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow you: neither have I desired the woeful day; you know: that which came out of my lips was right before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be not a terror unto me: you are my hope in the day of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And say unto them, Hear all of you the word of the LORD, all of you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus says the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do all of you any work, but hallow all of you the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall come to pass, if all of you diligently hearken unto me, says the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and food offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But if all of you will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
