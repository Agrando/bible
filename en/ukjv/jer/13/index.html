For the greatness of yours iniquity are your skirts discovered, and your heels made bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may all of you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is your lot, the portion of your measures from me, says the LORD; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore will I discover your skirts upon your face, that your shame may appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen yours adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your whoredom, and yours abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto you, O Jerusalem! will you not be made clean? when shall it once be?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
