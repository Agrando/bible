is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Set you up guideposts, make you high heaps: set yours heart toward the highway, even the way which you went: return, O virgin of Israel, return to these your cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>How long will you go about, O you backsliding daughter? for the LORD has created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless you, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall come to pass, that like I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eats the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, says the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, says the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus says the LORD, which gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divides the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If those ordinances depart from before me, says the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus says the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the measuring line shall yet go forth opposite to it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
