Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ah Lord GOD! behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You show loving kindness unto thousands, and recompence the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for yours eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Which have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and have made you a name, as at this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And have brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And have given them this land, which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commandedst them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what you have spoken has come to pass; and, behold, you see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you have said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy you the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this city has been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof all of you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For thus says the LORD; Like I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof all of you say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, says the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
