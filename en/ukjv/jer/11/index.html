Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear all of you the words of this covenant, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have all of you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What has my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she has wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the LORD of hosts, that planted you, has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD has given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then you showed me their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for unto you have I revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
