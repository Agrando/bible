And he answered, Nothing: nevertheless let me go in any way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to Jeroboam, Take you ten pieces: for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto you, even ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it shall be, if you will hearken unto all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his position.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
