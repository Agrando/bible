And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom all of you sold into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that all of you sold me here: for God did send me before you to preserve life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For these two years has the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earring nor harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So now it was not you that sent me here, but God: and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Haste all of you, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near unto me, you, and your children, and your children's children, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there will I nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine; lest you, and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all of you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that all of you have seen; and all of you shall haste and bring down my father here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto your brethren, This do all of you; load your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and all of you shall eat the fat of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now you are commanded, this do all of you; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and food for his father by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that all of you fall not out by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
