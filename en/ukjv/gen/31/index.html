Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unexpectedly to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with delight, and with songs, with timbrel, and with harp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And have not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you have now done foolishly in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke unto me last night, saying, Take you heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now, though you would essentially be gone, because you sore longed after your father's house, yet wherefore have you stolen my gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Possibly you would take by force your daughters from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With whomsoever you find your gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern you what is yours with me, and take it to you. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob was angry, and find fault with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whereas you have searched all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock have I not eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto you; I bare the loss of it; of my hand did you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you had sent me away now empty. God has seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked you last night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now therefore come you, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If you shall afflict my daughters, or if you shall take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
