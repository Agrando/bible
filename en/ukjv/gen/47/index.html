And they said unto Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said moreover unto Pharaoh, In order to sojourn in the land are we come; for your servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying, Your father and your brethren are come unto you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in your presence?
