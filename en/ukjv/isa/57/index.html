Should I receive comfort in these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Upon a lofty and high mountain have you set your bed: even thither went you up to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behind the doors also and the posts have you set up your remembrance: for you have discovered yourself to another than me, and are gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you a covenant with them; you loved their bed where you saw it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you went to the king with ointment, and did increase your perfumes, and did send your messengers far off, and did debase yourself even unto hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are wearied in the greatness of your way; yet said you not, There is no hope: you have found the life of yours hand; therefore you were not grieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and you fear me not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall not profit you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When you cry, let your companies deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that puts his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And shall say, Cast all of you up, cast all of you up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always angry: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and stroke him: I hid me, and was angry, and he went on perversely in the way of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, says the LORD; and I will heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
