These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus says the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But all of you are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and all of you shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, all of you did not answer; when I spoke, all of you did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but all of you shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but all of you shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but all of you shall be ashamed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but all of you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And all of you shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay you, and call his servants by another name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be all of you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
