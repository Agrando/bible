Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yours eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yours heart shall meditate terror.
