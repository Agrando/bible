Then said I, Here am I; send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear all of you indeed, but understand not; and see all of you indeed, but perceive not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
