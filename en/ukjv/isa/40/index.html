And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withers, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows upon it: surely the people is grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withers, the flower fades: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Zion, that bring good tidings, get you up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bring good tidings, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor has taught him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will all of you liken God? or what likeness will all of you compare unto him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The workman melts a graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and casts silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that is so impoverished that he has no oblation chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have all of you not known? have all of you not heard? has it not been told you from the beginning? have all of you not understood from the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is he that sits upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That brings the princes to nothing; he makes the judges of the earth as vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will all of you liken me, or shall I be equal? says the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why says you, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Have you not known? have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He gives power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increases strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
