Moreover I will subdue all yours enemies. Furthermore I tell you that the LORD will build you an house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall come to pass, when your days be expired that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, which shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build me an house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that you have brought me until now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And yet this was a small thing in yours eyes, O God; for you have also spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What can David speak more to you for the honour of your servant? for you know your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, for your servant's sake, and according to yours own heart, have you done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O LORD, there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For your people Israel did you make yours own people for ever; and you, LORD, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let it even be established, that your name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David your servant be established before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you, O my God, have told your servant that you will build him an house: therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, LORD, you are God, and have promised this goodness unto your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may be before you for ever: for you bless, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
