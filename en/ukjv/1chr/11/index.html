Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said, Whosoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.
