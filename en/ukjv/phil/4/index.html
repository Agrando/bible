The Lord is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those things, which all of you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein all of you were also careful, but all of you lacked opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I speak in respect of lack: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Notwithstanding all of you have well done, that all of you did communicate with my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now all of you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning (o. logos) giving and receiving, but all of you only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For even in Thessalonica all of you sent once and again unto my necessity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. (o. logos)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
