And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he spoke unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar opposite to the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that all of you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that all of you have built you an altar, that all of you might rebel this day against the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But that all of you must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing all of you rebel to day against the LORD, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass all of you over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knows, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or food offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have all of you to do with the LORD God of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the LORD has made Jordan a border between us and you, all of you children of Reuben and children of Gad; all of you have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, All of you have no part in the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for food offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because all of you have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now all of you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
