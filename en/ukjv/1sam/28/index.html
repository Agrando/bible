And Achish said unto David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me to battle, you and your men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David said to Achish, Surely you shall know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you keeper of mine head for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that has a familiar spirit at Endor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray you, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the woman said unto him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto you? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known unto me what I shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Samuel, Wherefore then do you ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from you, and is become yours enemy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD has done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD has rent the kingdom out of yours hand, and given it to your neighbour, even to David:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because you obeyed not the voice of the LORD, nor executed his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore has the LORD done this thing unto you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines: and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Saul fell immediately all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, yours handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto your words which you spoke unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore, I pray you, hearken you also unto the voice of yours handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
