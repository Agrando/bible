And David avoided out of his presence twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son in law in the one of the two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king's son in law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Saul said, Thus shall all of you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
