am not I a Philistine, and all of you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall all of you be our servants, and serve us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for your brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how your brethren fare, and take their pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the men of Israel said, Have all of you seen this man that has come up? surely to defy Israel is he comes up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why came you down here? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of yours heart; for you are come down that you might see the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And David said unto Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I went out after him, and stroke him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and stroke him, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of armour formed by chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a pouch; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and rosy, and of a fair countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This day will the LORD deliver you into mine hand; and I will strike you, and take yours head from you; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and stroke the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and stroke the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And the king said, Enquire you whose son the teenager is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
