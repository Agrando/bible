And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he stroke the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, tomorrow you shall be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said unto Michal, Why have you deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
