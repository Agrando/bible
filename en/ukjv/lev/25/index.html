for you, and for your servant, and for your maid, and for your hired servant, and for your stranger that sojourns with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And for your cattle, and for the beast that are in your land, shall all the increase thereof be food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall number seven sabbaths of years unto you, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto you forty and nine years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall all of you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all of you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and all of you shall return every man unto his possession, and all of you shall return every man unto his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: all of you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: all of you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the year of this jubile all of you shall return every man unto his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you sell ought unto your neighbour, or buy ought of your neighbour's hand, all of you shall not oppress one another:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to the number of years after the jubile you shall buy of your neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>According to the multitude of years you shall increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years you shall diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits does he sell unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All of you shall not therefore oppress one another; but you shall fear your God:for I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wherefore all of you shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and all of you shall dwell in the land in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the land shall yield her fruit, and all of you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if all of you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all of you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in all of you shall eat of the old store.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for all of you are strangers and sojourners with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in all the land of your possession all of you shall grant a redemption for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If your brother be becoming poor, and has sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the surplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if your brother be becoming poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Take you no interest of him, or increase: but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You shall not give him your money upon interest, nor lend him your victuals for increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And if your brother that dwells by you be becoming poor, and be sold unto you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you, and shall serve you unto the year of jubile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And then shall he depart from you, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You shall not rule over him with rigour; but shall fear your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Both your bondmen, and your bondmaids, which you shall have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall all of you buy bondmen and bondmaids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall all of you buy, and of their families that are with you, which they brings forth in your land: and they shall be your possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And all of you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, all of you shall not rule one over another with rigour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by you, and your brother that dwells by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by you, or to the stock of the stranger's family:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
