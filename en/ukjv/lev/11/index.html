he is unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the coney, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the hare, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof;

they are unclean to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These shall all of you eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall all of you eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They shall be even an abomination unto you; all of you shall not eat of their flesh, but all of you shall have their carcasses in abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whatsoever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these are they which all of you shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the vulture, and the buzzard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Every raven after his kind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the swan, and the pelican, and the carrion vulture,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet these may all of you eat of every flying creeping thing that goes upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap likewise upon the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even these of them all of you may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And for these all of you shall be unclean: whosoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whosoever bears ought of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The carcasses of every beast which divides the hoof, and is not cloven footed, nor chews the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that touches them shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whatsoever goes upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso touches their carcass shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he that bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth;

whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And every earthen vessel, into where any of them falls, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and all of you shall break it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Of all food which may be eaten, that on which such water comes shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And if any part of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And if any beast, of which all of you may eat, die; he that touches the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he that eats of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that bears the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Whatsoever goes upon the belly, and whatsoever goes upon all four, or whatsoever has more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them all of you shall not eat; for they are an abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>All of you shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps, neither shall all of you make yourselves unclean with them, that all of you should be defiled thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For I am the LORD your God: all of you shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and all of you shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall all of you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For I am the LORD that brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: all of you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps upon the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
