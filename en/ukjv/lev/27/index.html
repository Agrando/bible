if it be a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man gives of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you value it, who are the priest, so shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto your estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation unto it, and it shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to your estimation it shall stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be decreased from your estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if he that sanctified the field will in any way redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the field, when it goes out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted;

but shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
