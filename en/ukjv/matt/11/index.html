A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what went all of you out in order to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what went all of you out in order to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if all of you will receive it, this is Elijah, which was in order to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But unto which shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And saying, We have piped unto you, and all of you have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and all of you have not lamented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine indulger, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then began he to reproach the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe unto you, Chorazin! woe unto you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum, which are exalted unto heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come unto me, all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and all of you shall find rest unto your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
