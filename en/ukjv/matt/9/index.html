And he arose, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at food in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eats your Master with publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But go all of you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples fast not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No man puts a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runs out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he spoke these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand upon her, and she shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; your faith has made you whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, You son of David, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus says unto them, Believe all of you that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils through the prince of the devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then says he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is abundant, but the labourers are few;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pray all of you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
