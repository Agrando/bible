And Jesus says unto them, Yea; have all of you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and infants you have perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If all of you have faith, and doubt not, all of you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if all of you shall say unto this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all things, whatsoever all of you shall ask in prayer, believing, all of you shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, (o. logos) which if all of you tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did all of you not then believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But what think all of you? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether of them two did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus says unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and all of you believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and all of you, when all of you had seen it, repented not afterward, that all of you might believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the lord therefore of the vineyard comes, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus says unto them, Did all of you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
