if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not leave the ninety and nine, and goes into the mountains, and seeks that which is gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word (o. rhema) may be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto you as an heathen man and a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever all of you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever all of you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as concerning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus says unto him, I say not unto you, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account (o. logos) of his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that you owe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O you wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you desired me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Should not you also have had compassion on your fellow servant, even as I had pity on you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if all of you from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
