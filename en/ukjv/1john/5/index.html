And it is the Spirit (o. pneuma) that bears witness, because the Spirit (o. pneuma) is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, (o. logos) and the Holy Spirit: (o. pneuma) and these three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, (o. pneuma) and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the Son of God has not life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that all of you may know that all of you have eternal life, and that all of you may believe on the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
