Hereby know we the spirit (o. pneuma) of truth, and the spirit (o. pneuma) of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another: for love (o. agape) is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. (o. agape)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this was manifested the love (o. agape) of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Herein is love, (o. agape) not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love (o. agape) is perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we have known and believed the love (o. agape) that God has to us. God is love; (o. agape) and he that dwells in love (o. agape) dwells in God, and God in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Herein is our love (o. agape) made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love; (o. agape) but perfect love (o. agape) casts out fear: because fear has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in love.
