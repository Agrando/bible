Wherefore he says, God resists the proud, but gives grace unto the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, all of you sinners; and purify your hearts, all of you double minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who are you that judge another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go to now, all of you that say, To day or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whereas all of you know not what shall be on the next day. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that all of you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now all of you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
