If any man offend not in word, (o. logos) the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, anywhere the governor decides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the embodiment of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is a wise man and imbued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if all of you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be implored, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
