Does God take care for oxen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or says he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that plows should plow in hope; and that he that threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do all of you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know all of you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that all of you may obtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
