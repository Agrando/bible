(o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which works all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the manifestation of the Spirit (o. pneuma) is given to every man to profit likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In order to one is given by the Spirit (o. pneuma) the word (o. logos) of wisdom; to another the word (o. logos) of knowledge by the same Spirit; (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>To another faith by the same Spirit; (o. pneuma) to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; (o. pneuma) to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But all these works that one and the very same Spirit, (o. pneuma) dividing to every man severally as he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For by one Spirit (o. pneuma) are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the body is not one member, but many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now has God set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they were all one member, where were the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now are they many members, yet but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of you: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our indecent parts have more abundant loveliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For our comely parts have no need: but God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That there should be no division in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now all of you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I unto you a more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
