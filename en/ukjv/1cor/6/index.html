Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because all of you go to law one with another. Why do all of you not rather endure wrong? why do all of you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nay, all of you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know all of you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you: but all of you are washed, but all of you are sanctified, but all of you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit (o. pneuma) of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know all of you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What? know all of you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, says he, shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is without the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What? know all of you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (o. pneuma) which is in you, which all of you have of God, and all of you are not your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For all of you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, (o. pneuma) which are God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
