for you do not enquire wisely concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to them that have it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also has set the one opposite to the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you destroy yourself ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be not over much wicked, neither be you foolish: why should you die before your time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good that you should take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not yours hand: for he that fears God shall come out of them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For there is not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest you hear your servant curse you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For oftentimes also yours own heart knows that you yourself likewise have cursed others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, this have I found, says the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Which yet my soul seeks, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lo, this only have I found, that God has made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
