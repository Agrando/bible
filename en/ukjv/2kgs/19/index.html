for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It may be the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard: wherefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that are left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall all of you say to your master, Thus says the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he has come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus shall all of you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwell between the cherubims, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>LORD, bow down yours ear, and hear: open, LORD, yours eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truthfully, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, O LORD our God, I plead to you, save you us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD God, even you only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, That which you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up yours eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By your messengers you have reproached the LORD, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have you not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I know your abode, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because your rage against me and your tumult has come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this shall be a sign unto you, All of you shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow all of you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and stroke in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons stroke him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his position.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
