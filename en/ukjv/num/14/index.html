And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be before they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a greater nation and mightier than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if you shall kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, I plead to you, let the power of my LORD be great, according as you have spoken, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pardon, I plead to you, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of your mercy, and as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to your word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into where he went; and his seed shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
