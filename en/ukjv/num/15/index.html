as all of you do, so he shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourns with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as all of you are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourns with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When all of you come into the land where I bring you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then it shall be, that, when all of you eat of the bread of the land, all of you shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All of you shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as all of you do the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall all of you heave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Of the first of your dough all of you shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if all of you have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken unto Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Even all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his food offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them;

and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a thread of blue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that all of you may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that all of you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which all of you use to go a whoring:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That all of you may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
