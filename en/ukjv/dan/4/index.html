Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate you, and the interpretation thereof to yours enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is you, O king, that are grown and become strong: for your greatness is grown, and reachs unto heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which has come upon my lord the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom shall be sure unto you, after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and yours iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of your tranquillity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What do you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to bring low.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
