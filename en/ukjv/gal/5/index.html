(o. agape)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All of you did run well; who did hinder you that all of you should not obey the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This persuasion comes not of him that calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that all of you will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, brethren, all of you have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love (o. agape) serve one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, (o. logos) even in this; You shall love your neighbour as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if all of you bite and devour one another, take heed that all of you be not consumed one of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, (o. pneuma) and all of you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, (o. pneuma) and the Spirit (o. pneuma) against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that all of you cannot do the things that all of you would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if all of you be led of the Spirit, (o. pneuma) all of you are not under the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, worldy jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit (o. pneuma) is love, (o. agape) joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Meekness, wilful restrain: against such there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live in the Spirit, (o. pneuma) let us also walk in the Spirit.
