for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, all of you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that all of you might affect them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, all of you that desire to be under the law, do all of you not hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which genders to bondage, which is Agar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that bear not; break forth and cry, you that travail not: for the desolate has many more children than she which has an husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, (o. pneuma) even so it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nevertheless what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
