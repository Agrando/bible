Yea, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that regards the day, regards it unto the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In order to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But why do you judge your brother? or why do you set at nothing your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then every one of us shall give account (o. logos) of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if your brother be grieved with your food, now walk you not charitably. (o. agape) Destroy not him with your food, for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he that in these things serves Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For food destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Have you faith? have it to yourself before God. Happy is he that condemns not himself in that thing which he allows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he that doubts is damned if he eat, because he eats not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
