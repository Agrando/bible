Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become useless; there is none that does good, no, not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and misery are in their ways:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the way of peace have they not known:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that what things whatsoever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
