For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore all of you must essentially be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For for this cause pay all of you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, (o. logos) namely, You shall love your neighbour as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love (o. agape) works no ill to his neighbour: therefore love (o. agape) is the fulfilling of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put all of you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
