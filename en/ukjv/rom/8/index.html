(o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For the law of the Spirit (o. pneuma) of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit (o. pneuma) the things of the Spirit. (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In order to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually (o. pneuma) minded is life and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But all of you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, (o. pneuma) if so be that the Spirit (o. pneuma) of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit (o. pneuma) of Christ, he is none of his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit (o. pneuma) is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit (o. pneuma) of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also retore life in your mortal bodies by his Spirit (o. pneuma) that dwells in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if all of you live after the flesh, all of you shall die: but if all of you through the Spirit (o. pneuma) do mortify the deeds of the body, all of you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit (o. pneuma) of God, they are the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For all of you have not received the spirit (o. pneuma) of bondage again to fear; but all of you have received the Spirit (o. pneuma) of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit (o. pneuma) itself bears witness with our spirit, (o. pneuma) that we are the children of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earn expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation groans and labors in pain together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, (o. pneuma) even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to know, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the Spirit (o. pneuma) also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit (o. pneuma) itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, (o. pneuma) because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that has risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love (o. agape) of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love (o. agape) of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
