And he answered him and said, You says it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he questioned with him in many words; (o. logos) but he answered him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Said unto them, All of you have brought this man unto me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man concerning those things whereof all of you accuse him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breast which never gave suck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And saying, If you be the king of the Jews, save yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you be Christ, save yourself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: (o. pneuma) and having said thus, he gave up the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, stroke their breasts, and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood far off, beholding these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
