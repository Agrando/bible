for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto you, and to show you these glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, (o. logos) which shall be fulfilled in their season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favoured, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, (o. logos) and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favour with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit (o. pneuma) shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For with God nothing (o. rhema) shall be impossible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word. (o. rhema) And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit: (o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For, lo, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirit (o. pneuma) has rejoiced in God my Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said unto her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings (o. rhema) were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, (o. pneuma) and prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, (o. pneuma) and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
