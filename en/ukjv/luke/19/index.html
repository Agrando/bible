You knew that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Wherefore then gave not you my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(And they said unto him, Lord, he has ten pounds.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For I say unto you, That unto every one which has shall be given; and from him that has not, even that he has shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Saying, Go all of you into the village opposite to you; in the which at your entering all of you shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if any man ask you, Why do all of you loose him? thus shall all of you say unto him, Because the Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose all of you the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke your disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things which belong unto your peace! but now they are hid from yours eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days shall come upon you, that yours enemies shall cast a trench about you, and compass you round, and keep you in on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And shall lay you even with the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone upon another; because you knew not the time of your visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but all of you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
