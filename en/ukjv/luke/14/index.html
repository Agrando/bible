And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they could not answer him again to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When you are bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than you be bidden of him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he that bade you and him come and say to you, Give this man place; and you begin with shame to take the low room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when you are bidden, go and sit down in the low room; that when he that bade you comes, he may say unto you, Friend, go up higher: then shall you have worship in the presence of them that sit to eat with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For whosoever exalts himself shall be brought low; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he also to him that bade him, When you make a dinner or a supper, call not your friends, nor your brethren, neither your kinsmen, nor your rich neighbours; lest they also bid you again, and a recompence be made you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when you make a feast, call the poor, the physically disabled, the lame, the blind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall be blessed; for they cannot recompense you: for you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when one of them that sat at food with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must essentially go and see it: I pray you have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray you have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the physically disabled, and the halt, and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you have commanded, and yet there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whosoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you, intending to build a tower, sits not down first, and counts the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lest lest by any means, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king, going to make war against another king, sits not down first, and consults whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an embassy, and desires conditions of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
