O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endures for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can show forth all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that does righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that you bear unto your people: O visit me with your salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That I may see the good of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with yours inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers understood not your wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of your mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They soon forgotten about his works; they waited not for his counsel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus they changed their glory into the embodiment of an ox that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgotten about God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke without due consideration with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto your holy name, and to triumph in your praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise all of you the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
