so shall you dwell in the land, and verily you shall be fed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Delight yourself also in the LORD: and he shall give you the desires of yours heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Commit your way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgment as the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not yourself because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not yourself in any way to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, you shall diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes upon him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD shall laugh at him: for he sees that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of many wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholds the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The LORD knows the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked borrows, and pays not again: but the righteous shows mercy, and gives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delights in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholds him with his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He is ever merciful, and lends; and his seed is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the LORD loves judgment, and forsakes not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt you to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
