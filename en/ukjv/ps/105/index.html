call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk all of you of all his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Glory all of you in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember his marvellous works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O all of you seed of Abraham his servant, all of you children of Jacob his chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He has remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying, Unto you will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtlely with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He stroke their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He spoke, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He stroke also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise all of you the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
