So did you get you a name, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you did divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors you threw into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You came down also upon mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And made known unto them your holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to your commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsook them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet you in your manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You gave also your good spirit to instruct them, and withheld not your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover you gave them kingdoms and nations, and did divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Their children also multiplied you as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land, concerning which you had promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells dug, vineyards, and olive yards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their backs, and slew your prophets which testified against them to turn them to you, and they wrought great provocations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after they had rest, they did evil again before you: therefore left you them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And testified against them, that you might bring them again unto your law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto your commandments, but sinned against your judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yet many years did you forbear them, and testified against them by your spirit in your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the people of the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Nevertheless for your great mercies' sake you did not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keep covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before you, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless you are just in all that is brought upon us; for you have done right, but we have done wickedly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor hearkened unto your commandments and your testimonies, wherewith you did testify against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that you gave unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it yields much increase unto the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
