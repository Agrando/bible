And he said, Of a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And frequently it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said unto him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him that believes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help you mine unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, (o. pneuma) saying unto him, You dumb and deaf spirit, (o. pneuma) I charge you, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they understood not that saying, (o. rhema) and were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that all of you disputed among yourselves by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sat down, and called the twelve, and says unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me: and whosoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he follows not us: and we forbad him, because he follows not us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For he that is not against us is on our part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because all of you belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if your hand offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life physically disabled, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if your foot offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if yours eye offend you, pluck it out: it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltiness, wherewith will all of you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
