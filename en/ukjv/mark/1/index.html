(o. pneuma)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit (o. pneuma) like a dove descending upon him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there came a voice from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And immediately the spirit (o. pneuma) drives him into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent all of you, and believe the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus said unto them, Come all of you after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; (o. pneuma) and he cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the unclean spirit (o. pneuma) had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commands he even the unclean spirits, (o. pneuma) and they do obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and soon they tell him of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If you will, you can make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and says unto him, I will; be you clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And says unto him, See you say nothing to any man: but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, (o. logos) insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
