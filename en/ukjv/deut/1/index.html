but all of you shall hear the small as well as the great; all of you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I commanded you at that time all the things which all of you should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which all of you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I said unto you, All of you are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has said unto you; fear not, neither be discouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all of you came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God does give us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Notwithstanding all of you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And all of you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Where shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The LORD your God which goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bare you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that all of you went, until all of you came into this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet in this thing all of you did not believe the LORD your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way all of you should go, and in a cloud by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Moreover your little ones, which all of you said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then all of you answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when all of you had girded on every man his weapons of war, all of you were ready to go up into the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest all of you be smitten before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So I spoke unto you; and all of you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And all of you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So all of you abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that all of you abode there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
