and that your days may be prolonged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that all of you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall love the LORD your God with all yours heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And these words, which I command you this day, shall be in yours heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in yours house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall bind them for a sign upon yours hand, and they shall be as frontlets between yours eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you shall write them upon the posts of your house, and on your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall be, when the LORD your God shall have brought you into the land which he swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you great and goodly cities, which you builded not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And houses full of all good things, which you filled not, and wells dug, which you dug not, vineyards and olive trees, which you planted not;
