and all of you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All of you shall not do so unto the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall all of you seek, and thither you shall come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thither all of you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there all of you shall eat before the LORD your God, and all of you shall rejoice in all that all of you put your hand unto, all of you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All of you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all of you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when all of you go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that all of you dwell in safety;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall all of you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which all of you vow unto the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all of you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, all of you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your male servants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he has no part nor inheritance with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Take heed to yourself that you offer not your burnt offerings in every place that you see:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatsoever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Only all of you shall not eat the blood; all of you shall pour it upon the earth as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstlings of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of yours hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put yours hands unto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Take heed to yourself that you forsake not the Levite as long as you live upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the LORD your God shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh, because your soul longs to eat flesh;

and that you enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You shall not do so unto the LORD your God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hates, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Whatsoever I command you, observe to do it: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
