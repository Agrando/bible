even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when all of you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Nevertheless the LORD your God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing unto you, because the LORD your God loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You shall not detest an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not detest an Egyptian; because you were a stranger in his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the host goes forth against yours enemies, then keep you from every wicked thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chances him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You shall have a place also without the camp, where you shall go forth abroad:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall have a paddle upon your weapon; and it shall be, when you will ease yourself abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up yours enemies before you; therefore shall your camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall dwell with you, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of your gates, where it likes him best: you shall not oppress him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not lend upon interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon interest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Unto a stranger you may lend upon interest; but unto your brother you shall not lend upon interest: that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you set yours hand to in the land where you go to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When you shall vow a vow unto the LORD your God, you shall not slack to pay it: for the LORD your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That which is gone out of your lips you shall keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as you have vowed unto the LORD your God, which you have promised with your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When you come into your neighbour's vineyard, then you may eat grapes your fill at yours own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When you come into the standing corn of your neighbour, then you may pluck the ears with yours hand; but you shall not move a sickle unto your neighbour's standing corn.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
