or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he has taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he takes a man's life to pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and makes merchandise of him, or sells him; then that thief shall die; and you shall put evil away from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so all of you shall observe to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what the LORD your God did unto Miriam by the way, after that all of you were come forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you do lend your brother any thing, you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall stand abroad, and the man to whom you do lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if the man be poor, you shall not sleep with his pledge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In any case you shall deliver him the pledge again when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless you: and it shall be righteousness unto you before the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of your brethren, or of your strangers that are in your land within your gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and sets his heart upon it: lest he cry against you unto the LORD, and it be sin unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But you shall remember that you were a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you thence: therefore I command you to do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When you cut down yours harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of yours hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you beat yours olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall remember that you were a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
