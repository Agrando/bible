(o. logos)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
