as the LORD had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Get you unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goes out unto the water; and you shall stand by the river's brink meeting him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in yours hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me unto you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, until now you would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus says the LORD, In this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will strike with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out yours hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and stroke the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
