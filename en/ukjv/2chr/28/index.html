And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who stroke him with a great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and all of you have slain them in a rage that reachs up unto heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now all of you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which all of you have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And said unto them, All of you shall not bring in the captives here: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, all of you intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which stroke him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his position.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
