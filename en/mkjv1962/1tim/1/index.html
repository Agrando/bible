Grace, mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even as I begged you to remain at Ephesus, when I was going to Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies (which provide doubts rather than the] nurture of God in faith).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>from which some, having swerved, have turned aside to foolish talking,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>desiring to be teachers of the law, neither understanding what they say nor that which they affirm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But we know that the law [is] good if a man uses it lawfully,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>knowing this, that the law [is] not made for a righteous one, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for fornicators, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and anything else that is contrary to sound doctrine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who strengthened me, because He counted me faithful, putting [me] into the ministry--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the [one] who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and insolent. But I obtained mercy, because being ignorant, I did [it] in unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>[And] the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Faithful [is] the Word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, as a pattern to those being about to believe on Him to life everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, [the] only wise God, [be] honor and glory forever and ever.
