But rather let them serve, because they are faithful and beloved, those of the good service receiving in return. Teach and exhort these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone teaches otherwise, and does not consent to wholesome words (those of our Lord Jesus Christ), and to the doctrine according to godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is proud, knowing nothing. [He is] sick concerning doubts and arguments, from which comes envy, strife, evil speakings, evil suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>meddling, of men whose minds have been corrupted and deprived of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness. Withdraw from such.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into the world, [and it is] clear that we can carry nothing out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But having food and clothing, we will be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they who will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is a root of all evils, of which some having lusted after, they were seduced from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, to which you are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I charge you before God (who makes all things alive) and [in the sight of] Christ Jesus (who witnessed the good confession to Pontius Pilate),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that you keep the commandment without spot and without blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For He in His own time will reveal [who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who alone has immortality, dwelling in light which cannot be approached, whom no one of men have seen, nor can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Charge the rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, He offering to us richly all things to enjoy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to share, to be generous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, guard the Deposit, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of falsely-named science,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with you. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
