A man with a measuring line in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what [is] its breadth and what is its length.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited, [as] towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in her midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I, says the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire all around, and will be the glory in her midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ho!
