The LORD shall make storm clouds, and He gives them showers of rain, grass to everyone in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For the family idols speak iniquity, and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams. They comfort in vain; therefore they wandered like a flock; they were troubled because there was no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for the LORD of hosts has visited His flock the house of Judah, and has made them as His beautiful horse in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Out of Him came the cornerstone; out of Him the nail; out of Him the battle bow; out of Him every oppressor together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they shall be like mighty ones who trample the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight because the LORD [is] with them, and they shall make the riders on horses ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will return to save them; for I have pity on them. And they shall be as though I had not cast them off; for I [ am] the LORD their God, and I will answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Ephraim shall be like a mighty one, and their heart shall rejoice as [by] wine. And their sons shall see and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I will hiss for them and gather them; for I have redeemed them. And they shall be many as they were many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in the distances; and they shall live with their sons and return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I will return them out of the land of Egypt, and I will gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; for [room] shall not be found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he shall pass through the sea of distress, and shall strike the waves in the sea; and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up. And the pride of Assyria shall be humbled, and the scepter of Egypt shall move away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in His name, says the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
