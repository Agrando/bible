And half of the city shall go into exile, and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the LORD shall go out and fight against those nations, like the day He fought in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which [is] before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall divide from its middle, from the east and to the west, a very great valley. And half of the mountain shall move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall flee to the valley of My mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it will be in that day, there shall not be light; the glorious ones shall shrink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it will be one day which shall be known to the LORD, neither day nor night; but it will happen that at evening time it shall be light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be in that day, living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them shall go toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea.

And it shall rise and dwell in its place, from Benjamin's Gate to the place of the First Gate; to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they shall dwell in it, and there shall never again be a shutting in, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem. Their flesh shall rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes shall rot in their sockets. And their tongue shall rot in their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall be in that day a great panic of the LORD shall be among them And they shall each one lay hold of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations all around shall be gathered, gold, and silver, and clothing in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so shall be the plague of the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and of all the beasts which shall be in these tents, like this plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be, everyone who is left of all the nations which came up against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall be, whoever will not come up from all the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, even on them shall be no rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the family of Egypt does not go up, nor come in, they shall have no rain, but the plague with which the LORD shall strike the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This shall be Egypt's offense, and the offense of all the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day there shall be on the bells of the horses, HOLY TO THE LORD.
