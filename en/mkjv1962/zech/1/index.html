But they did not hear nor listen to Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Your fathers, where [are] they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But My words and My statutes which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they returned and said, As the LORD of hosts planned to do to us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so He has done with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, it [is] the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I watched by night. And behold! a Man riding on a red horse, and He stood among the myrtle trees in the ravine. And behind Him were red, sorrel and white horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, O my lord, what [are] these? And the angel who talked with me said to me, I will show you what these [are].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These [are] those whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they answered the Angel of the LORD who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sits still and is at peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah against which You have cursed these seventy years?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD answered the angel who talked with me [with] good words, comfortable words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying, So says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion [with] a great jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And with great anger I am angry at the nations at ease; [in] that I was but a little angry, and they gave help for evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore so says the LORD: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies. My house shall be built in it, says the LORD of hosts. And a line shall be stretched over Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Cry out again, saying, So says the LORD of hosts: My cities shall yet be spread abroad through good, and the LORD shall again overflow with goodness, and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, four horns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said to the angel who talked with me, What [are] these? And he answered me, These [are] the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I said, What [are] these coming to do? And He spoke, saying, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who lifted up [their] horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
