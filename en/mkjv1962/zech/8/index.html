And they shall be My people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So says the LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that in the day the house of the LORD of hosts is laid, the temple is to be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For before these days there was no payment for man, nor was there payment for animal; and there was no peace to him from the adversary who went out or came in. For I sent every man, a man against his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But now I [will] not [be] to the remnant of this people as in the former days, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the seed [shall be] blessed; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it will be, as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear, but let your hands be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For so says the LORD of hosts: As I thought to punish you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, says the LORD of hosts, and I did not repent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so again I have thought in these days to do well to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These [are] the things that you shall do. [Each] man speak the truth to his neighbor. Judge [with] truth and justice for peace in your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And let each devise no evil in your heart [against] his neighbor; and love no false oath. For all these are things that I hate, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth [month], and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah for joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So says the LORD of hosts: There yet shall be peoples and inhabitants of many cities;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the residents of one shall go to another, saying, Let us go at once to seek favor of the face of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will go also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to seek the favor of the face of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So says the LORD of hosts: In those days ten men, out of all languages of the nations, shall take hold, and will seize the skirt of a man, a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
