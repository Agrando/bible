And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will take away his bloods out of his mouth, and his idolatries from between his teeth. But the remnant, even he, [shall be] for our God. And he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron like a Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will camp around My house because of an army, because of him who passed by, and because of him who returns. And no tyrant shall pass through them any more. For now I have seen with My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, your King comes to you. He is righteous and victorious, meek and riding on an ass, even on a colt, the son of an ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem. And the battle bow shall be cut off, and He shall speak peace to the nations; and His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You also, by the blood of Your covenant I have freed Your prisoners out of the pit in which is no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Turn to the stronghold, prisoners of hope; even today I declare that I will return to you double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have bent Judah for me [as] a bow; I filled it with Ephraim, and I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and make you as the sword of a mighty man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth like the lightning; and the Lord GOD shall blow the ram's horn, and shall go out with the windstorms of the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour and trample the slingstones.
