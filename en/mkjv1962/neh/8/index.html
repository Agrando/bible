And they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Ezra the priest brought the Law before the congregation, both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he read in it before the street in front of the Water Gate from the morning until noon, in front of the men and the women, and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people [listened] to the Book of the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people.

Do not mourn or weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to them, Go eat the fat and drink the sweet, and send portions to him for [whom] nothing is prepared. For [this] day [is] holy to our LORD. And do not be sorry, for the joy of the LORD [is] your strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Levites quieted all the people, saying, Be quiet, for the day [is] holy.
