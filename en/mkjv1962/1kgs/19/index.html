And he begged for his life, that he might die. And he said, It is enough. O LORD, take away my life. For I [am] no better than my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And as he lay and slept under a broom tree, behold, then an angel touched him and said to him, Arise, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he looked, and, behold, a cake [was] baked on the coals, and a jug of water at his head. And he ate and drank, and lay down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel of the LORD came to him the second time and touched him, and said, Arise, eat, because the journey [is] too great for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he came there to a cave and stayed there. And behold, the word of the LORD [came] to him, and He said to him, What [are] you [doing] here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah the God of Hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, thrown down Your altars, and have slain Your prophets with the sword. And I, I alone, am left. And they seek to take my life away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He said, Go forth and stand on the mountain before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke the rocks in pieces before the LORD. [ But] the LORD [was] not in the wind. And after the wind was an earthquake, [but] the LORD was not in the earthquake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after the earthquake was a fire, [but] the LORD [was] not in the fire. And after the fire [was] a still, small voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened when Elijah heard, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out, and stood at the cave entrance. And behold, a voice [came] to him and said, What [are] you [doing] here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah, God of Hosts, because the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, have thrown down Your altars, and have slain Your prophets with the sword. And I, I alone, am left. And they seek to take my life away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you come, anoint Hazael [to be] king over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi [to be] king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint [to be] prophet in your place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it will be, whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill. And whoever escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I have left seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he left there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, and he [was] plowing; twelve pairs [of oxen were] before him, and he [was] with the twelfth. And Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, please, let me kiss my father and my mother, and I will follow you. And he said to him, Go back again, for what have I done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he turned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave it to the people, and they ate. And he arose and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
