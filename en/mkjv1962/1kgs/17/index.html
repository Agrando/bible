And I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he went and did according to the word of the LORD. For he went and lived by the torrent Cherith, before Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the torrent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it happened after a while, the torrent dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Arise, go to Zarephath which [belongs] to Sidon, and live there. Behold, I have commanded a widow to keep you there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he arose and went to Zarephath, and came in to the entrance of the city, and, behold, the widow was gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, Please, bring me a little water in a vessel so that I may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as she was going to bring [it], he called to her and said, Please, bring me a piece of bread in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she said, [As] the LORD your God lives, I do not have a cake, but only a handful of meal in a pitcher and a little oil in a jar. And behold, I [am] gathering two sticks, so that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, so that we may eat it and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elijah said to her, Do not fear, go. Do as you have said. But first make me a little cake of it, and bring [it] to me. And then make for you and for your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For so says the LORD God of Israel, The pitcher of meal shall not be emptied, nor shall the jar of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah. And she and he and her house ate [many] days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the pitcher of meal was not consumed, and the jar of oil did not fail, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke by Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened after these things the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick. And his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said to Elijah, What do I have to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to call my sin to remembrance and to kill my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft, where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, have You also brought evil on the widow with whom I am staying, by slaying her son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, please let this child's soul come to him again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the room into the house and delivered him to his mother. And Elijah said, See! Your son lives!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know this, that you [are] a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth [is] truth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
