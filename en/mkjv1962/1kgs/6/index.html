Ten cubits [was] its breadth on the front of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And for the house he made windows of narrow frames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And against the wall of the house he built floors all around, [against] the walls of the house all around, of the temple and of the sanctuary. And he made rooms all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The lowest story [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] six cubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house he made narrowed ledges for the house all around, so as not to lay hold of the walls of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when it was being built, the house was built of stone made ready beforehand. And there was not heard in the house a hammer or an axe, [or] any iron tool, while it was being built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The door for the middle story [was] in the right side of the house. And they went up with winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he built the house and finished it. And he covered the house [with] beams and rows of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he built the side-stories on all the house, five cubits high. And they rested on the house [with] timbers of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the word of the LORD came to Solomon saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>[As to] this house which you are building, if you will walk in My statutes and do My judgments and keep all My commandments, to walk in them, then I will perform My work with you which I spoke to David your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will live among the sons of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Solomon built the house and finished it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he built the walls of the house inside with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling. He covered [them] on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar. He even built [them] for it inside, for the sanctuary, for the Holy of Holies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the house, that [is], the temple before [it], was forty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the cedar of the house inside [was] carved with gourds and open flowers. All [was] cedar; there was no stone seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he prepared the Holy of Holies in the house inside, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Holy of Holies in the front part [was] twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in height. And he overlaid it with pure gold, and covered the altar of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Solomon overlaid the house inside with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across before the Holy of Holies. And [he] overlaid it with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until he had finished all the house. Also all of the altar that [belonged] to the Holy of Holies, he overlaid with gold:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And inside the Holy of Holies he made two cherubs [of] olive wood, ten cubits high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And one wing of the cherub [was] five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits; ten cubits from the ends of its wings even to the ends of its wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the other cherub [was] ten cubits. Both the cherubs were of one measure and one size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The height of the one cherub [was] ten cubits, and so [was] the other cherub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he set the cherubs inside the inner house. And they stretched forth the wings of the cherubs so that the wing of the one touched the [one] wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he overlaid the cherubs with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he carved all the walls of the house all around with carved figures of cherubs and palm trees and open flowers, inside and out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the floor of the house was overlaid with gold inside and out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As to the entrance of the holy place he made doors [of] olive wood. The lintel [and] side posts were a fifth part,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the two doors [were of] olive wood. And he carved on them carvings of cherubs and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubs and on the palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So also he made side posts for the entrance of the temple from the olive tree, a fourth part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the two doors [were of] fir tree. The two leaves of the one door [were] folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he carved [on them] cherubs and palm trees and open bowers. And he covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he built the inner court with three rows of cut stone, and a row of cedar beams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the fourth year, in the month Zif, the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which [is] the eighth month, the house was finished as to all its parts, and as to all its plans. So he was seven years in building it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
