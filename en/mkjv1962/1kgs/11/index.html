Solomon clung to these in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For it happened when Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods. And his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as [was] the heart of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and Solomon did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and did not [go] fully after the LORD like his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill which [is] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And likewise he did for all his foreign wives, and burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD [was] angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; and he did not keep that which the LORD commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to Solomon, Since this is done by you, and since you have not kept My covenant and My statutes which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I will not do it in your days, for David your father's sake, [but] I will tear it out of the hand of your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Only, I will not tear away all the kingdom, [but] I will give one tribe to your son for David My servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it happened the LORD stirred up a foe to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He [was] of the king's seed in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For it happened when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had stricken every male in Edom--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for Joab remained there six months with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>it happened that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go to Egypt, Hadad [being] still a little child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they arose out of Midian and came to Paran. And [they] took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and appointed food for him, and gave him land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him the sister of his own wife for a wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, even Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart so that I may go to my own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me that, behold, you seek to go to your land? And he answered, Nothing; however, you shall certainly send me away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God stirred up [another] foe, to him, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gathered men to him, and became head over a band when David killed them. And they went to Damascus and lived in it, and reigned in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he was a foe to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief which Hadad [did]. And he hated Israel and reigned over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name [was] Zeruah, a widow, he too lifted up [his] hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this [was] the cause that he lifted up [his] hand against the king. Solomon built Millo [and] repaired the breaks of the city of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the man Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of war. And Solomon, seeing that the young man was doing work, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh found him in the way. And he had clothed himself with a new garment. And the two of them [were] alone in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahijah caught hold of the new robe on him, and tore it [in] twelve pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces for yourself. For so says the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but he shall have one tribe for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the goddess of the sons of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways, to do [what is right] in My eyes, and to keep My statutes and My judgments, as David his father did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose, because he kept My commandments and My statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And to his son I will give one tribe, so that David My servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for Me, to put My name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in My ways, and do [what is] right in My sight, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as David My servant did, it shall happen that I will be with you and build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And for this I will afflict the seed of David, but not forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, [are] they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel [were] forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
