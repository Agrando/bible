And go to Shiloh. Behold, there [is] Ahijah the prophet, who told me about [being] king over this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And take ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey with you, and go to him. And he will tell you what shall become of the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose and went to Shiloh. And she came to the house of Ahijah. And Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were set because of his age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to ask a thing of you for her son, for he [is] sick. This and this you shall say to her, for when she comes in, she shall act as a stranger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it happened when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, he said, Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you acting as a stranger? For I [am] sent to you [with] a hard thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go tell Jeroboam, So says the LORD God of Israel, I lifted you up from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. And you have not been as My servant David who kept My commandments, and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only [what was] right in My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you have done evil above all who were before you, for you have gone and made yourself other gods, and molded images, to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates against the wall, bound and free in Israel, and will sweep away the rest of the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away the dung, until it is all gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Those of Jeroboam who die in the city, the dogs shall eat. And those who die in the field, the fowls of the air shall eat. For the LORD has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And arise, get down to your own house. When your feet enter into the city, the boy shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him. For he only of Jeroboam shall come down to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD shall raise up a king over Israel for Himself, a king who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. And what? Even now!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the LORD shall strike Israel as the reed waves in the water, and He shall root up Israel out of this good land which He gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherahs, provoking the LORD to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned, and that he made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jeroboam's wife arose, and left, and came to Tirzah. When she came to the doorsill the boy died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred and how he reigned, behold, [they] are written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the days which Jeroboam reigned [were] twenty-two years. And he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam [was] forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD chose out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. And his mother's name [was] Naamah, an Ammonitess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they also built high places for themselves, and images, and Asherahs, on every high hill and under every green tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And also the sodomite was in the land. They did according to all the hateful things of the nations which the LORD cast out before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt, he came up against Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house. He took all away. And he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed [them] to the hands of the chief of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it happened when the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard carried them and brought them back into the guard chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, [are] they not written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all [their] days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name [was] Naamah, an Ammonitess. And his son Abijam reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
