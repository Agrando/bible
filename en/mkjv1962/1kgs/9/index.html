I have made this house which you have built holy, to put My name there forever. And My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if you will walk before Me as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you; [and] if you will keep My statutes and My judgments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom on Israel forever, as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall not be cut off to you a man on the throne of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If you shall at all turn from following Me, you or your sons, and will not keep My commandments [and] My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then I will cut off Israel from the face of the land which I have given them. And this house which I have made holy for My name I will cast out of My sight. And Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As to this house [which] is exalted, everyone who passes by it shall be amazed and shall hiss. And they shall say, Why has the LORD done this to this land and to this house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they shall answer, Because they left the LORD their God who brought out their fathers from the land of Egypt, and have taken hold on other gods and have worshiped them and served them. On account of this the LORD has brought on them all this evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened at the end of twenty years, Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desires. Then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him. And they did not please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, What cities [are] these which you have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hiram sent to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this [is] the reason of the labor force which King Solomon raised to build the house of the LORD and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had gone up and had taken Gezer and had burned it with fire, and had slain the Canaanites who lived in the city. And he had given it [for] a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the lower,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he built all the store-cities which Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all the people [who were] left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who [were] not of the sons of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel also were not able to destroy completely, on those Solomon laid a tribute of bond-service to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Solomon did not make any slave out of the sons of Israel. But they [were] men of war, and his servants, and his rulers, and his commanders, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These [were] the chief of the officers who [were] over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty who ruled over the people who labored in the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which had been built for her. And he built Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built to the LORD, and he burned incense on the altar which [was] before the LORD. And he finished the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which [is] beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came to Ophir, and brought gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought [it] to king Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
