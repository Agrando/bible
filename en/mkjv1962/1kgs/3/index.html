Only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there. For that [was] the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night. And God said, Ask what I shall give you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Solomon said, You have shown to Your servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before You in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with You. And You have kept this great kindness for him, that You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as [it is] today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king instead of David my father. And I [am] a little child; I do not know to go out or come in!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Your servant [is] in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a numerous people who cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And give to Your servant an understanding heart, to judge Your people, to discern between good and bad. For who is able to judge this, Your great people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the word was good in the eyes of the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, and have not asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to judge justly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>behold, I have done according to your words. Lo, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart, so that there was none like you before you, and after you none shall arise like you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I also have given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like you all your days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you will walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Solomon awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then there came two women, harlots, to the king, and stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the one woman said, O my lord, this woman and I live in one house. And I was bore a child with her in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it happened the third day after I gave birth, this woman bore a child also. And we [were] together; there was no stranger with us in the house, except the two of us in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this woman's child died in the night, because she laid on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me, while your servant was sleeping, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When I arose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, [it was] dead. And when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son whom I bore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the other woman said, No, but the living [is] my son, and the dead [is] your son. And this one said, No, but the dead is your son, and the living is my son. So they spoke before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the king said, The one says, This [is] my son who lives, and your son [is] the dead. And the other says, No, but your son [is] the dead, and my son [is] the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the woman whose son [was] the living child said to the king, for her womb yearned over her son. And she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor yours; divide [it] !</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no way kill it. She [is] the mother of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged. And they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God [was] in him to do judgment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
