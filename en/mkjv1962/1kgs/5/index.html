For Hiram was always a lover of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You know how David my father could not build a house to the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which were around him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But now the LORD my God has given me rest all around. [There is] no foe nor evil happening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold, I purpose to build a house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place; he shall build a house to My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now command that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon, and my servants shall be with your servants. And I will give you hire for your servants according to all that you shall say. For you know that not a man among us can cut timber like the Sidonians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it happened when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed [be] the LORD this day, who has given David a wise son over this great people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hiram sent to Solomon saying, I have heard that for which you sent to me. I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My servants shall bring [them] down from Lebanon to the sea. And I will bring them by sea in floats to the place that you shall name. And I will cause them to be left there, and you shall receive  them]. And you shall fulfill my desire in giving food for my household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees, all his desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat [for] food for his household, and twenty measures of pure oil. So Solomon gave to Hiram year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon. And the two of them made a treaty together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel. And the labor force [was] thirty thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month, by courses. They were a month in Lebanon, [and] two months at home. And Adoniram was over the labor force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand woodcutters in the mountains,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>besides the chief of Solomon's overseers who [were] over the work, thirty-three hundred, who ruled over the people who labored in the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, cut stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Giblites cut out and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
