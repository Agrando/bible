And he finished all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he built the house of the forest of Lebanon. Its length [was] a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And [it was] covered with cedar above on the beams [that lay] on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And windows [were] in three rows, and light [was] against light [in] three rows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And all the doors and posts [were] square, with the windows. And the front of a window [was] against a window [in] three rows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he made a porch of pillars. Its length [was] fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. And the porch [was] before them, and the pillars and the roof [were] over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he made a porch of the throne where he judged, the porch of judgment. And [it was] covered with cedar from floor to floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As to his house where he lived, the other court [was] within the porch, as this work was. Solomon also made a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken, like this porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All these [were] of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, inside and out, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the foundation [was] of costly stones, huge stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And above [were] costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stone and cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the great court all around [was] with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He [was] the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And he was filled with wisdom and understanding, and cunning to work all works in bronze. And he came to King Solomon and did all his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he cast two pillars of bronze, eighteen cubits [was] the height of the one pillar. And a line of twelve cubits went around the second pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he made two capitals [of] melted bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital [was] five cubits, and the height of the other capital five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He made gratings, grating work [with] twisted threads of chain-work, for the capitals on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he made the pillars. And two rows were all around on the one grating, to cover the capitals on the top with the pomegranates. And so he did for the other capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the capitals on the top of the pillars in the porch [were] lily-work, four cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the capitals on the two pillars [had pomegranates] on the upper part, over against the belly which [was] by the grating; and the pomegranates [were] two hundred in rows all around on the other capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple. And he set up the right pillar and called its name, Jachin. And he set up the left pillar, and called its name, Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And on the top of the pillars [was] lily-work. So the work of the pillars was finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, all around it. And its height [was] five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits went around it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And under its brim [were] gourds, going around it, ten by the cubit, going all around the sea. The gourds [were] cast in two rows when it was cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It stood on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east. The sea [was set] on top of them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it [was] a handbreadth thick, and its brim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, [with] a bud of a lily. It contained two thousand baths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he made ten bases of bronze, four cubits the length of the one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the work of the bases [was] this [way]: they had borders, and the borders were between the stays.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And on the borders that [were] between the ledges [were] lions, oxen, and cherubs. And a pedestal was on the stays above. And beneath the lions and oxen [were] wreaths of hanging-work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the one base had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze. And its four feet [were] supports to them; under the basin were casted supports [with] wreaths at each side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And its mouth within and above the capital [was] a cubit. And its mouth [was] round [like] the work of a pedestal, a cubit and half of the cubit. And also on its mouth were carvings; and their borders were square, not round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And under the borders [were] four wheels. And the axletrees of the wheels [were] in the base. And the height of a wheel [was] a cubit and a half.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the work of the wheels [was] like the work of a chariot wheel, their axletrees, and their rims, and their hub, and their spokes, [were] all cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And [there were] four supports to the four corners of one base, and the supports were of the very base itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the top of the base [was] a round compass of a half a cubit high. And on the top of the base its sides and its borders [were] from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he engraved cherubs, lions, and palm trees on the plates of its sides, and on its borders, as the place of each, with wreaths all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So he made the ten bases, one casting, one measure, one form was to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he made ten basins of bronze. One basin contained forty baths. The one basin was four cubits, one basin on the one base, to the ten bases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. And he set the sea on the right side of the house, eastward, across from the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work that he did for] King Solomon [for] the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two pillars, and the bowls of the capitals on the top of the two pillars, and the two gratings to cover the two bowls of the capitals on the top of the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two gratings; two rows of pomegranates for each grating, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which [were] on the face of the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and the ten bases, and ten basins on the bases,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. All these vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD [were of] burnished bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The king cast them in the plain of Jordan, in the thick soil of the ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed] because [they were] exceeding many; the weight of the bronze was not searched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Solomon made all the vessels in the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which [was] the Bread of the Presence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right and five on the left, in front of the Holy of Holies, with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs [of] gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire-pans [of] pure gold, and the hinges of gold for the doors of the inner house, the Holy of Holies, and for the doors of the house, the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So all the work that King Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated: the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, he had put into the treasuries of the house of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
