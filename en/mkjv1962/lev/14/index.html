He shall be brought to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the priest shall go forth out of the camp. And the priest shall look, and behold, [if] the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>then the priest shall command to take two clean live birds for him that is to be cleansed, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He shall take the living bird, and the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the slain bird, over the running water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he shall sprinkle on him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water so that he may be clean. And after that he shall come into the camp, and shall stay outside his tent seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eye-brows; even all his hair shall he shave off. And he shall wash his clothes. He also shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three-tenth parts of fine flour [for] a food offering, mixed with oil, and one log of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priest who is cleansing, and the man who is to be cleansed, shall stand with them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the priest shall take one male lamb and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them [for] a wave offering before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he shall kill the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place. For as the sin offering [is] the priest's, so is the trespass offering. It [is] most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the priest shall take from the log of oil and pour into the palm of his own left hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil in his left hand and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And of the rest of the oil in his hand, the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the trespass offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the rest of the oil in the priest's palm he shall pour on the head of him that is to be cleansed. And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest shall offer the sin offering and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the food offering on the altar. And the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if he [is] poor and his hand cannot reach [so much], then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one-tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a food offering, and a log of oil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, such as his hand can reach.

And the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This [is] the law of him in whom [is] the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to reach in his cleansing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When you come into the land of Canaan which I give you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house in the land of your possession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and if he that owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, A plague [is] seen by me in the house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to see the plague, so that all that [is] in the house may not become unclean. And afterwards the priest shall go in to see the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he shall look on the plague. And behold, [if] the plague [is] in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the priest shall come again the seventh day and shall look. And behold, [if] the plague has spread in the walls of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague [is], and they shall throw them into an unclean place outside the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside all around, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off outside the city in an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they shall take other stones and put [them] in the place of those stones. And he shall take other mortar and shall plaster the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if the plague comes again and breaks out in the house after he has taken away the stones and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>then the priest shall come and look. And behold, [if] the plague has spread in the house, it [is] a fretting leprosy in the house. It [is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber of it, and all the mortar of the house, and he shall carry [them] out of the city into an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he that goes into the house all the days that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he that lies in the house shall wash his clothes. And he that eats in the house shall wash his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And if the priest shall come in and look, and, behold, the plague has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the plague is healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he shall take two birds to cleanse the house, and cedar-wood, and scarlet [dye], and hyssop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet dye, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field, and make an atonement for the house. And it shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This [is] the law for all kinds of plague of leprosy and scab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and for the leprosy of a garment and of a house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and for a rising and for a scab and for a bright spot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>to teach when [it is] unclean and when it is clean. This [is] the law of leprosy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
