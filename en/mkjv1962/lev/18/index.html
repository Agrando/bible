And you shall not do like the doings of the land of Canaan, where I bring you. Neither shall you walk in their ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You shall do My judgments and keep My ordinances, to walk in them. I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live in them. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>None of you shall approach to any who are near of kin to him, to uncover [their] nakedness. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father or the nakedness of your mother.
