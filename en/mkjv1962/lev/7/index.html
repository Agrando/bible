It is most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In the place where they kill the burnt offering, they shall kill the trespass offering. And he shall sprinkle its blood on the altar all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he shall offer all its fat; he shall offer the fat tail of it, and the fat that covers the inward parts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and the two kidneys, and the fat on them, on the loins, and the fold above the liver, beside the kidneys, he shall take away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the priest shall burn them on the altar for a fire offering to the LORD. It is a trespass offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Every male among the priests shall eat of it. It shall be eaten in the holy place. It [is] most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As the sin offering, so [is] the trespass offering. There is one law for them. The priest that makes atonement with it, it is his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the priest that offers any man's burnt offering, that priest shall have the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered; it is his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the food offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan and on the griddle, shall be the priest's that offers it; it is his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every food offering mixed with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one like another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this [is] the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which he shall offer to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mixed with oil, of fine flour, fried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Besides the cakes, he shall offer [for] his offering unleavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And from it he shall offer one cake out of the whole sacrifice for a heave offering to the LORD, to the priest that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings; it is his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if the sacrifice of his offering [is] a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice. And on the next day also the rest of it shall be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the rest of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if [any] of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offerings is eaten at all the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it. It shall be an abomination, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the flesh that touches any unclean [thing] shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. And as for the flesh, all who are clean shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the soul that eats [of] the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that pertain to the LORD, having his uncleanness on him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the soul that shall touch any unclean [thing], of the uncleanness of man, or any unclean animal, or an unclean abominable thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, You shall not eat any fat of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the fat of a dead body, and the fat of a thing torn, may be used in any other use.
