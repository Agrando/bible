I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do not turn to idols, nor make molten gods to yourselves. I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it of your own free will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the next day. And if anything remains until the third day, it shall be burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it [is] abominable. It shall not be accepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And anyone that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of the LORD. And that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corner of your field. And you shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall not glean your vineyard. And you shall not gather the leavings of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and the stranger. I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall not steal, nor lie, nor be deceitful to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall not swear by My name falsely; nor shall you profane the name of your God. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall not defraud your neighbor nor rob [him]. The wages of him who is hired shall not stay with you until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shall fear your God. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. You shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; [but] you shall judge your neighbor in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You shall not go [as] a slanderer among your people; you shall not stand against the blood of your neighbor. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall always rebuke your neighbor, and not allow sin on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people; but you shall love your neighbor as yourself. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall keep My statutes. You shall not let your cattle breed with different kinds. You shall not sow your field with two kinds [of] seed. And you shall not allow clothing mixed of linen and wool to come on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And whoever lies with a woman with semen, and she is a slave-girl, betrothed to a husband and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her, there shall be an inquest. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he has done. And the sin which he has done shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit of them as uncircumcised. It shall be uncircumcised three years to you. It shall not be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in the fourth year all the fruit of them shall be holy to praise the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fifth year you shall eat of the fruit of it, so that it may yield to you its increase. I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You shall not eat [anything] with the blood. You shall not divine, nor conjure [spirits].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You shall not round the side of your head, nor mar the edge of your beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks on you. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You shall not prostitute your daughter, to cause her to be a whore, lest the land go whoring, and the land become full of wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>You shall keep My sabbaths and revere My sanctuary. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You shall not turn to those that have familiar spirits, nor seek to spiritists to be defiled by them. I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You shall rise up before the gray head and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a stranger lives with you in your land, you shall not oppress him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself. For you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures and weights, or in quantity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin. I [am] the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And you shall observe all My statutes and all My judgments, and do them. I [am] the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
