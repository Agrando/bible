And eat it there with the bread in the basket of consecrations, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation seven days, until the days of your consecration are at an end. For He shall consecrate you seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As He has done this day, the LORD has commanded you to do, to make an atonement for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And you shall remain [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, so that you do not die. For so I am commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
