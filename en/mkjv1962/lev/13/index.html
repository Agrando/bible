And [if] the hair in the plague has turned white, and the plague in sight [is] deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy. And the priest shall look on him and shall pronounce him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if the bright spot [is] white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight is not deeper than the skin, and the hair of it has not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the plague seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the priest shall look on him the seventh day. And behold, [if] the plague in his sight is stayed; the plague has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall look on him again in the seventh day. And, behold, [if] the plague [is] somewhat dark; the plague has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean. It [is] a scab. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the scab spreads greatly in the skin after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And [if] the priest sees that, behold, the scab spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] a leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the priest shall look. And, behold, if the rising is white in the skin, and it has turned the hair white and [there is] live raw flesh in the rising,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>it [is] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh. And the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a leprosy breaks out greatly on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the [one who has] the plague from his head even to his foot, to all that appears to the eyes of the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>then the priest shall look. And behold, [if] the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the plagued one clean. It has all turned white. He is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean. The raw flesh [is] unclean; it [is] a leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, he shall come to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the priest shall look on him. And, behold, the plague has turned to white, then the priest shall pronounce the plagued one clean. He [is] clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the flesh has a boil in his skin, and it has healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and in the place of the boil there is a white rising or a bright spot, a reddish white, it shall be shown to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and if the priest sees it, and behold, it [is] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair of it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] a plague of leprosy broken out in a boil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the priest looks on it, and, behold, [there are] no white hairs in it, and it [is] not lower than the skin, but has become dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if it spreads greatly in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] a plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if the bright spot stays in its place, not spreading, it [is] a burning boil. And the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Or if there is flesh in which the skin has a hot burning, and the raw [flesh] of the burning [becomes] a white bright spot, reddish or white,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then the priest shall look on it. And behold, the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and [it is] in sight deeper than the skin, it [is] leprosy broken out of the burning. Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] the plague of leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the priest looks on it, and behold, there [is] no white hair in the bright spot, and it [is] no lower than the [other] skin, but is somewhat dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the priest shall look on him the seventh day. If it spreads farther in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] the plague of leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if the bright spot stays in its place, and does not spread in the skin, but [is] somewhat faded, it [is] a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it [is] a scar of the burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If a man or woman has in them a plague on the head or the beard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>then the priest shall see the plague. And behold, if it [is] in sight deeper than the skin, and a yellow thin hair [is] in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] a dry scab, a leprosy on the head or beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if the priest looks on the plague of the scab, and behold, it [is] not in sight deeper than the skin, and no black hair [is] in it, then the priest shall shut up the plagued one [with] the scab seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague. And behold, [if] the scab does not spread, and no yellow hair [is] in it, and the scab [is] not in sight deeper than the skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he shall be shaven, but shall not shave the scab. And the priest shall shut up [the one who has] the scab seven days more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scab. And behold, [if] the scab has not spread in the skin, nor [is] in sight deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if the scab spreads very much in the skin after his cleansing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then the priest shall look on him, and behold, if the scab is spread in the skin, the priest shall not look for shining yellow hair. He [is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if in his eyes the scab is stabilized, and black hair is growing up in it, the scab is healed. He [is] clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Also if a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of their flesh, white bright spots,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then the priest shall look. And behold, [if] pale white bright spots [are] in the skin of their flesh, it [is] a pale spot springing up in the skin. He [is] clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when a man's head grows bald; he [is] bald. He [is] clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if his head grows bald from the edge of his face, he [is] forehead bald. He [is] clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And if there is in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore, it [is] a leprosy sprung up in his bald head or his bald forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the priest shall look on it. And behold, [if] the rising of the sore is reddish white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appears in the skin of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he [is] a man with leprosy. He [is] unclean. The priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean. His plague [is] in his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And as for the leper in whom the plague [is], his clothes shall be torn, and his head shall be bare, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean! Unclean!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>All the days in which the plague [is] in him he shall be defiled. He is unclean. He shall live alone. His dwelling [shall be] outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if there is any garment that has the plague of leprosy in it, in a wool garment or a linen garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>or in the warp or in the woof, of linen or of wool, or in a skin or in anything of skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it [is] a plague of leprosy. And it shall be shown to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the priest shall look on the plague, and shut up [that which has] the plague seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day. If the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any skin [or] in any work that is made of skin, the plague  is] a fretting leprosy. It [is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of skin in which the plague is. For it [is] a fretting leprosy. It shall be burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or the woof, or anything of skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>then the priest shall command that they wash [the thing] in which the plague is. And he shall shut it up seven days more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the priest shall look on the plague after it is washed, and behold, [if] the plague has not changed its color and the plague has not spread; it [is] unclean. You shall burn it in the fire. It [is] eaten away in its inside or in its outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And if the priest looks, and behold, the plague [is] somewhat dark after the washing of it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And if it appears still in the garment, or in the warp or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it [is] a spreading [plague]. You shall burn that which [is] in it [is] the plague [is] with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And the garment which you shall wash, either warp or woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, if the plague has departed from them, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This [is] the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp or woof or anything of skins, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
