The priest shall value him according to the ability of him who vowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if [it is] an animal of which they bring an offering to the LORD, all that one gives of such to the LORD shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And if he shall at all change animal for animal, then it and the exchange of it shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if [it is] any unclean animal, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the animal before the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest value it, so shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth [part] of it to what you judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when a man shall sanctify his house [to be] holy to the LORD, then the priest shall judge it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest shall judge it, so shall it stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if he who sanctified it desires to redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the silver of your judgment, and it shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD [some part] of a field that he owns, then your judgment shall be according to its seed; a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to your judgment it shall stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the silver according to the years that remain, even until the year of jubilee, and it shall be taken from your estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if he who sanctified the field desires in any way to redeem it, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be made sure to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted. The possession of it shall be the priest's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if [a man] sanctifies to the LORD a field which he has bought, which [is] not of the fields he owns,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then the priest shall count to him the worth of your estimation, until the year of jubilee. And he shall give your estimation in that day, a holy thing to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to him who owns [it in] the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all your judgments shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>However, the first-born of an animal, which should be the LORD's first-born, no man shall sanctify it, whether an ox, or sheep, it is the LORD's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if [it is] of an unclean animal, then he shall redeem it according to your estimation, and shall add a fifth [part] of it to it. Or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>However, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, either of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Every devoted thing [is] most holy to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Nothing devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed, [but] shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, [is] the LORD's. [It is] holy to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if a man will at all redeem anything of his tithes, he shall add to it the fifth [part] of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And all the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, all that passes under the rod, a tenth shall be holy to the LORD</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it. And if he changes it at all, then both it and the change of it shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These [are] the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in Mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
