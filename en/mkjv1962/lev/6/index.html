He shall give it on the day of his guilt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, together with an amount set by you, for a trespass offering, to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD, and it shall be forgiven him for anything of all that he has done by being guilty in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This [is] the law of the burnt offering. It is the burnt offering for burning on the altar all night to the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the priest shall put on his linen garment. And he shall put his linen breeches on his flesh and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar. And he shall put them beside the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he shall strip off his garments and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not be put out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order on it. And he shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The fire shall always be burning on the altar. It shall never go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this [is] the law of the food offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD before the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he shall take from it his handful of the flour of the food offering, and of the oil of it, and all the frankincense which is on the food offering, and shall burn [it] on the altar for a sweet savor, the memorial of it, to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten [with] unleavened bread in the holy place. They shall eat it in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it [as] their portion of My offerings made by fire. It [is] most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All the males among the sons of Aaron shall eat of it. [It shall be] a statute forever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire. Everyone that touches them shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This [is] the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day [he is] anointed, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a continual food offering, half of it in the morning and half of it at night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It shall be made in a pan with oil; you shall bring it in. And you shall offer the baked pieces of the food offering, a sweet savor to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the priest of his sons, who is anointed in his stead, shall offer it. [It is] a statute forever to the LORD. It shall be wholly burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For every food offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt. It shall not be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This [is] the law of the sin offering. In the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before the LORD. It [is] most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in the holy place, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy. And when any of its blood is sprinkled on any garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled in the holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. And if it is boiled in a bronze pot, it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>All the males among the priests shall eat of it. It [is] most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And no sin offering, of which [any] of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation for atonement in the sanctuary, shall be eaten. It shall be burned up in the fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
