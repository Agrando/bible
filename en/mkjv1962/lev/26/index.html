And you shall not set up any image of stone in your land in order to bow down to it. For I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You shall keep My sabbaths and revere My sanctuary. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time. And you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down and none shall make [you] afraid. And I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight. And your enemies shall fall by the sword in front of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish My covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall eat of the old provision, and clear away the old because of the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will set My tabernacle among you. And My soul shall not abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I [am] the LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from being their bondmen. And I have broken the bonds of your yoke, and made you go upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you will not listen to Me, and will not do all these commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if you shall despise My statutes, or if your soul hates My judgments, so that you will not do all My commandments, so that you break My covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will also do this to you: I will even appoint terror over you, consumption, and burning fever, consuming the eyes and causing sorrow of heart. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set My face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies. They that hate you shall reign over you. And you shall flee when none pursues you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if you will not yet listen to Me for all this, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heaven like iron and your earth like bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And your strength shall be spent in vain. For your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the field yield their fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if you walk contrary to Me, and will not listen to Me, I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also send wild beasts among you, who shall bereave you. And I will destroy your cattle, and make you few. And your highways shall be deserted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if you will not be reformed by Me by these things, but will still walk contrary to Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then I will walk contrary to you and will punish you seven [times more] for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword on you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant. And when you are gathered inside your cities, I will send the plague among you. And you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver [you] your bread again by weight. And you shall eat and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if you will not for all of this listen to Me, but will walk contrary to Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then I will walk contrary to you also in fury. And I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your high places and cut down your images, and throw your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and My soul shall despise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will make your cities waste and cause your sanctuaries to be deserted. And I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will turn the land into wasteland. And your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you. And your land shall be waste, and your cities waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lies waste, and [you are] in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest and enjoy its sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lies waste it shall rest, because it did not rest in your sabbaths when you lived on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And on those of you that are left I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as if fleeing from a sword. And they shall fall when none pursues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they shall fall on one another, as if it were before a sword, when none pursues. And you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that are left of you shall putrefy in their wilful sin in your enemies' lands. And also they shall putrefy with them in the perversities of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>If they shall confess their wilfulness and the wilfulness of their fathers, with their sin which they sinned against Me, and that also they have walked contrary to Me--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I also have walked contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they then pay for their iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham I will remember. And I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also shall be forsaken by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lies waste without them. And they shall accept the punishment of their iniquities; because, even because they despised My judgments, and because their soul hated My statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I hate them, to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them. For I [am] the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But for their sakes, I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, so that I might be their God. I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These [are] the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between Him and the sons of Israel in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
