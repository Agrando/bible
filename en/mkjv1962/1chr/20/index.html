And he came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and destroyed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David took the crown of their king from off his head and found its weight a talent of gold. And precious stones [were] in it. And it was set on David's head, and he also brought exceeding much spoil out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he brought out the people who [were] in it. And [they] sawed with saws and with sharp tools of iron, and with the axes. And so David did with the cities of the sons of Ammon.
