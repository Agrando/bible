And I will subdue all your enemies. And I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it will be, when your days have ended so that you must go [to be] with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, who shall be from your sons. And I will make his kingdom sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. And I will not take My mercy away from him as I took [it] from him who was before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will settle him in My house, and in My kingdom forever. And his throne shall be established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who [am] I, O, Jehovah God, and what is my house, that You have brought me here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God, for You have also spoken of Your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What can David [say] more to You for the honor of Your servant? For You know Your servant!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, for Your servant's sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, in making known all [these] great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O LORD, [there is] none like You, neither [any] God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what one nation in the earth [is] like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem [to be] His own people, to make You a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before Your people whom You have redeemed out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And You have chosen Your people Israel for Yourself, for a people forever. And You, LORD, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now, O LORD, let the thing which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as You have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let it even be established, so that Your name may be magnified forever, saying, The LORD of hosts [is] the God of Israel, a God to Israel. And [let] the house of David Your servant be established before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For You, O my God, have told Your servant that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found [in his heart] to pray before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, LORD, You [are] God, and have promised this goodness to Your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And now let it please You to bless the house of Your servant so that it may be before You forever. For You have blessed, O LORD, and it [is] blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
