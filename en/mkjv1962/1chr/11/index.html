And the LORD your God said to you, You shall feed My people Israel, and you shall be ruler over My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron. And David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites [were] the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the people of Jebus said to David, You shall not come in here. But David took the stronghold of Zion, which [is] the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first and was chief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David lived in the stronghold. Therefore they called it the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he built the city all around, even from Millo all around. And Joab repaired the rest of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts [was] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And these [were] the chief of the mighty men whom David [had], making themselves strong with him in his kingdom, with all Israel to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this [is] the number of the mighty men whom David [had]: Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains. He lifted up his spear against three hundred, who were killed by him at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, he was one of the three mighty ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was with David at Pas-dammim. And there the Philistines were gathered together to battle and a portion of the field was full of barley. And the people fled from before the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they set themselves in the midst of that place, and delivered it, and killed the Philistines. And the LORD saved [them] by a great deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And three of the mighty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam. And the Philistine army camped in the Valley of the Giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David [was] then in the stronghold, and the Philistines garrison [was] then at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David longed and said, Oh that someone would give me drink from the water of the well of Bethlehem, which [was] by the gate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the three broke through the Philistine army and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David. But David would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, May my God forbid me to do this thing. Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in danger? For they brought it with their lives. And he [was] not willing to drink it. These three mighty ones did these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Abishai the brother of Joab [was] chief of the three. For lifting up his spear against three hundred, he killed them, and had a name among the three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Of the three, he was more honorable than the two for he was their captain. However, he did not attain the first three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a mighty man of Kabzeel, had done many acts. He killed two lion-like men of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he killed an Egyptian, a man of stature, five cubits high. And in the Egyptian's hand [was] a spear like a weaver's beam. And he went down to him with a staff and wrenched the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and killed him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These [things] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had the name among the three mighty ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but did not attain the [first] three. And David set him over his court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the mighty ones of the army: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Ahiezer the Anathothite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Ithai a son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Hezro of Carmel, Naarai the son of Ezbai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
