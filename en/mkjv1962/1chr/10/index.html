And the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the battle went sorely against Saul. And the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and pierce me with it, lest these uncircumcised ones come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not, for he was very much afraid.
