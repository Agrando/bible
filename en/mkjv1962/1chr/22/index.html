And he set masons to cut squared stones to build the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings, and bronze in abundance without weight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and also cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought in cedar trees in abundance to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said, Solomon my son [is] young and tender, and the house to be built for the LORD is to be highly magnificent, for a name and for beauty to all the lands. I will now prepare for it. And David prepared abundantly before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed much blood and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to My name because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. And I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall build a house for My name. And he shall be My son, and I [will be] his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, my son, may the LORD be with you and bless you, and build the house of the LORD your God as He has said of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Only may the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and direct you concerning Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then you shall prosper, if you take heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments with which the LORD charged Moses, concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage. Do not fear, nor be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver, and of bronze and iron without weight, for it is in abundance. I have prepared timber also, and stone, and you may add to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there [are] many workmen with you, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of skillful men for every kind of work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Of the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may the LORD be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David commanded all the rulers of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side? For He has given the people of the land into my hand. And the land is humbled before the LORD and before His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God. Arise therefore and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
