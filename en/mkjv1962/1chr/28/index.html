I [had] in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God said to me, You shall not build a house for My name, because you [have been] a man of war and have shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For He has chosen Judah to be the ruler, and of the house of Judah the house of my father. And in my father's house He was pleased to make me king over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons), He has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said to me, Solomon your son shall build My house and My courts, for I have chosen him [to be] My son, and I will be his Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will establish his kingdom forever if he will always do My commandments and My judgments, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God, so that you may possess this good land and leave [it] for an inheritance for your sons after you forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind. For the LORD searches all hearts and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you. But if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take heed now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary.

And he gave for the lampstands of silver by weight, for the lampstand and for its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and by weight gold for the tables of the showbread, for every table; silver for the tables of silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and pure gold for the flesh-hooks, and the bowls, and the cups; and for the golden basins by weight for each basin, and by weight for each basin of silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the altar of incense refined gold by weight, and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubs, who spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All [was] in writing from the hand of the LORD. He made me understand all the work of this pattern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do [it]. Do not fear, nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, my God, [will be] with you. He will not fail you nor leave you until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites are for all the service of the house of God.
