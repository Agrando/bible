And bring the number of them to me so that I may know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joab answered, May the LORD add to His people a hundred times, but my lord the king, [are] they not all my lord's servants? Why then does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the king's word prevailed against Joab. And Joab departed and went up and down all Israel, and came again to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to David. And in all Israel there were one million and a hundred thousand men who drew sword. And in Judah [were] four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Levi and Benjamin he did not count among them; for the king's word was evil to Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was evil in the eyes of God as to this thing. And He struck Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to God, I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. But now, I beseech You, remove the iniquity of Your servant for I have done very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go and speak to David, saying, So says the LORD: I offer you three [things]. Choose one of them so that I may do it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Gad came to David and said to him, So says the LORD, Choose for yourself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>either three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtake you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, even the plague in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the border of Israel. And now say what word I shall bring again to Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to Gad, I am in great distress. Let me fall now into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies [are] very great. But do not let me fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD sent a plague on Israel. And there fell seventy thousand men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. And as he was destroying, the LORD looked. And He repented of the evil and said to the angel who destroyed, Enough! Stay your hand now! And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between the earth and the heavens, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. And David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said to God, Did not I command to number the people? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed. But these sheep, what have they done? I pray You, let Your hand be on me, O LORD my God, and on my father's house, but not on Your people, that they should be plagued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and set up an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David went up at the word of Gad which he spoke in the name of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ornan turned back and saw the angel. And his four sons with him hid themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out of the threshing-floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, so that I may build an altar in it to the LORD. You shall give it to me for the full price, so that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Ornan said to David, Take for yourself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. Lo, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the food offering. I give it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And King David said to Ornan, No, but I will truly buy it for the full silver. For I will not take what [is] yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David built an altar there to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD. And He answered him from Heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the LORD commanded the angel, and he put up his sword again into its sheath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, [were] at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But David could not go before it to ask of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
