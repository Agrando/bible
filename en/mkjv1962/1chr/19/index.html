And his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun, in order to comfort him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the rulers of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, Is David honoring your father in your eyes, because he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Hanun took David's servants and shaved them, and cut off their garments in half, to the buttocks, and sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And [some] came and told David how the men were treated. And he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards are grown, and [then] return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves stink before David, and Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia and out of Maachah of Syria, and out of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they hired thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and pitched before Medeba. And the Ammonites gathered themselves from their cities and came to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David heard, and he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Ammon came out and put the battle in order before the gate of the city. And the kings who had come [were] by themselves in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, and he chose out of all the choice young men of Israel and set in order against the Syrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he delivered the rest of the people into the hand of his brother Abishai. And they set in order against the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me. But if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves bravely for our people, and for the cities of our God. And let the LORD do what is good in His sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joab and the people with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle. And they fled before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they also fled before his brother Abishai. And they entered into the city. And Joab came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Syrians saw that they were beaten before Israel, and sent messengers and drew forth the Syrians who [were] beyond the river. And Shophach the captain of the army of Hadarezer went before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told to David. And he gathered all Israel and passed over Jordan and came on them. And he set in order against them. And David set in order against the Syrians, and they fought with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the Syrians fled before Israel. And David killed seven thousand of the Syrians [in] chariots, and forty thousand footmen; and he killed Shophach the commander of the army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were beaten before Israel, and they made peace with David and became his servants. And Syria was not willing to help the sons of Ammon any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
