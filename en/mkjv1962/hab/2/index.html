Though it lingers, wait for it; because it will surely come. It will not tarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the soul of him is lifted up, [and] is not upright; but the just shall live by his faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And also wine indeed betrays a proud man, and [he is] not content. He widens his soul like Sheol, and he [is] like death, and is not satisfied, but gathers all nations to himself, and heaps to himself all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Shall not all these lift up a parable against him, and a mocking riddle to him, and say, Woe to him who increases [what is] not his! Until when, then, shall he load the pledges on himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Shall not those who strike you rise up suddenly, and [those] who shake you awake, and you become a prize to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because you have stripped many nations, all the rest of the people shall strip you; because of men's blood, and the violence of the land, of the city, and of all who dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe [to] him who robs evil booty for his house, to set his nest on high, to be delivered from the hand of evil!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have planned shame to your house, to make an end of many people, and are sinning [in] your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Woe [to] him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, [is it] not for the LORD of hosts that the people labor only for fire; yea, the nations weary themselves only for vanity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe [to] him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring out your wineskin, and also making [him] drunk, that you may look on their nakedness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You are filled with shame instead of glory; drink also, and [be] seen as one uncircumcised! The cup of the LORD's right hand shall turn on you, and disgrace [shall be] your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the ruin of beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of man, and the violence of the land, the city, and all those dwelling in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What does an image profit, for its maker has carved it; a molten image, and a teacher of lies? For does the maker trust in his work on it, to make dumb idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe [to] him who says to the wood. Awake! To a dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it [is] overlaid [with] gold and silver, and no breath is in its midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the LORD [is] in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
