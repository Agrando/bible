O LORD, give new life [to] Your work in the midst of years; in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covers the heavens, and His praise fills the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And [His] brightness is as the light; rays from His hand [are] His, and there [was] a hiding of His strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A plague went before Him, and lightning went forth at His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook nations, and the everlasting mountains were shattered; the eternal hills bowed down. His ways [are] everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw the tents of Cushan under calamity; the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Did the LORD burn against rivers? Or [was] Your anger against the rivers? Or Your wrath against the sea? [For] You ride on horses, Your chariots of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You make Your bow naked, [according to] the oaths of the rods of [Your] word. Selah. You have cut through the earth [with] rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They saw You; mountains trembled. The storm of water passed over; the deep uttered its voice [and] lifted up its hands on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun [and] moon stood still in their dwelling. At the light of Your arrows they go, and at the shining of Your gleaming spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You march into the land in fury; You thresh nations in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You went forth for the salvation of Your people, for salvation with Your anointed. You struck the head from the house of the wicked, to bare the foundation to the neck. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You pierced the head of his warriors with his shafts; they storm out to scatter me; their rejoicing [is] to devour the meek in a secret place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You trod in the sea with] Your horses, the foaming of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I heard and my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice. Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself that I might rest in the day of trouble; to come up against the people; he cuts him off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Though the fig tree shall not blossom, and fruit is not on the vines; the labor of the olive fails, and the fields yield no food. The flock is cut off from the fold, and no herd [is] in the stalls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah the Lord [is] my strength, and He will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and He will make me to walk on my high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
