And you came out with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: I will therefore spread out My net over you with an assembly of many peoples; and they shall lift you up in My net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will leave you on the land; I will cast you on the face of the field, and cause all the birds of the heavens to remain on you, and I will fill the beasts of all the earth with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will put your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when I put you out, I will cover the heaven and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I will make all the bright lights of the heavens dark over you, and will set darkness on your land, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your breaking among the nations, into the lands which you have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, I will make many people amazed at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble at [every] moment, [each] man for his own life, in the day of your fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For so says the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>By the swords of the mighty, I will cause your host to fall, the fearful of the nations, all of them. And they shall spoil the pride of Egypt, and all its host shall be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will also destroy all its beasts from beside the great waters. Nor shall the foot of man stir them any more, nor shall the hoofs of beasts stir them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make their waters sink, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When I shall make the land of Egypt a ruin, and the land shall be stripped of its fullness; when I shall strike all those who dwell in it; then they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This [is] the mourning with which they shall mourn her. The daughters of the nations shall mourn her; they shall mourn for her, for Egypt and for all her multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It was also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth of the month, [that] the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and bring it down, her and the daughters of the majestic nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down [into] the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Than whom are you more lovely? Go down and be laid with the uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They shall fall in the midst of [those] slain by the sword; she is delivered to the sword; they draw her and all her multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with those who help him. They have gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Assyria [is] there and all her company. His graves [are] around him; all of them are slain, fallen by the sword;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>their graves are set in the sides of the Pit, and her company is all around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, those who caused terror in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There [is] Elam and her multitude all around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living. Yet they have borne their shame with those who go down to the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude. Her graves [are] all around him; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; though their terror was given in the land of the living, yet they have borne their shame with those who go down to the Pit. He is put among the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There [is] Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude. Her graves [are] all around him. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they gave their terror in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they shall not lie with the mighty [that are] fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to hell with their weapons of war. And they have put their swords under their heads, but their sins shall be on their bones, though they [were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yea, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shall lie with [those] slain with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There [is] Edom, her kings, and all her rulers, who with their might are laid by [those] slain by the sword. They shall be with the uncircumcised and with those who go down to the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There [are] the rulers of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain in their terror. They are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army killed by the sword, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I had put his terror in the land of the living. And he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with [those] slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
