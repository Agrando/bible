In the latter years you shall come into the land turned back from the sword, gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have always been waste. (But he has been brought out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you shall go up, coming like a storm. You shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you and all your bands, and many peoples with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: And it shall be in that day that things shall come into your heart, and you shall devise an evil plan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you shall say, I will go up to the land of open spaces. I will go [to] those at ease, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and there are no bars nor gates to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in order to take a spoil, and to steal a prize; to turn your hand on the inhabited waste places, and on the people gathered out of the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, who dwell in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sheba and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all their young lions, shall say to you, Have you come to take a spoil? Have you gathered your company to steal a prize, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, So says the Lord Jehovah: In that day when My people of Israel dwells securely, shall you not know [it] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you shall come from your place out of the recesses of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall come up on My people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. It shall be in the last days, and I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: [Are] you he of whom I have spoken in former days, by the hand of My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days [and] years that I would bring you against them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall be on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, My fury shall come up in My face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For in My jealousy [and] in the fire of My wrath I have spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great quaking in the land of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all the men on the face of the earth, shall quake at My presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains, says the Lord Jehovah. [Each] man's sword shall be against his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will judge him with a plague and with blood. And I will rain on him, and on his bands, and on the many peoples with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire and brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself. And I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
