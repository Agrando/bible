And I will bring you up from the recesses of the north, and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your bands, and the people with you. I will give you for food to the birds of prey of every kind, and [to] the beasts of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You shall fall on the face of the field, for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will send a fire on Magog, and on the secure inhabitants of the coasts. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel. And I will not [let them] profane My holy name any more. And the nations shall know that I [am] the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, it is coming, and it will be done, says the Lord Jehovah. This [is] the day of which I have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go out and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the javelins, and the spears. And they shall burn them with fire seven years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>so that they shall take no wood out of the field, nor cut down [any] out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons for fire. And they shall plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it will be in that day I will give to Gog a place there, a grave in Israel, the valley of those who pass by, east of the sea. And it shall stop the [noses] of those who pass by. And there they shall bury Gog and all his multitude. And [they] shall call [it], The Valley of the Multitude of Gog.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the house of Israel shall bury them, to cleanse the land, seven months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all the people of the land shall bury. And it shall be a name to them, the day when I am glorified, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And men shall separate those who continually pass through the land, burying those who passed through, who remain on the face of the earth, to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they shall search.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And [as] they pass, those who pass through the land, and [any] man sees a bone, then he shall build a post beside it, until the buriers have buried it in The Valley of the Multitude of Gog.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And also the name of the city [is] The Multitude. And they shall cleanse the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you, son of man, So says the Lord Jehovah. Speak to the bird of every wing, and to every beast of the field: Gather yourselves and come; gather yourselves from all around to My sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, of rams, lambs, goats, [and] bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall eat fat until you are full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall be filled at My table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, all the men of war, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will set My glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see My judgments which I have done, and My hand that I have laid on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the house of Israel shall know that I [am] Jehovah their God from that day and forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the nations shall know that the house of Israel was exiled for their iniquity. Because they sinned against Me, therefore I hid My face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies. So they all fell by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>According to their uncleanness and according to their sins I have done to them, and have hidden My face from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: And I will return the captivity of Jacob, and will have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for My holy name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[after] they have borne their shame and all their sins by which they have sinned against Me, when they dwell securely in their land and no one terrifies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>when I have brought them again from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God who exiled them among the nations. But I have gathered them to their own land, and have not left any of them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Nor will I hide My face from them any more, for I have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
