And behold, twenty-five men were at the opening of the gate; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And He said to me, Son of man, these [are] the men who plot evil and give wicked advice in this city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>who say, [It is] not near; let us build houses; this [city is] the pot, and we [are] the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, O son of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak: So says the LORD: So you have said, O house of Israel, for I Myself know the elevations of your spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have multiplied your dead in this city, and you have filled its streets with the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom you have laid in her midst, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the pot. But I will bring you out of her midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword on you, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring you out of her midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel, and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This [city] shall not be your pot, nor shall you be the flesh in her midst. But I will judge you in the border of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and you shall know that I [am] the LORD. For you have not walked in My statutes, nor have you done My judgments, but have done after the customs of the nations all around you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened when I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. And I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! Will You make a full end [of] the remnant of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Again the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your redemption, and all the house of Israel, of all that have heard the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying to all of them, Go far away from Jehovah; this land is given to us for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Though I have sent them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the lands, yet I will be to them as a little sanctuary in the lands where they had gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore say, So says the Lord Jehovah: I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the lands, in those where you were scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall come there, and they shall take away all its hateful things and all its abominations from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will remove the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances, and do them. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And [as] to [those whose] heart is going [after] their hateful things, and [also] their heart [is after] their disgusting idols, I will give their way on their own heads, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and the wheels beside them. And the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. And the vision that I had seen went up from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I spoke to the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
