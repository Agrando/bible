Your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And [as for] your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse [you]. And you were not salted, nor swaddled at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>No eye pitied you, to do any of these to you, to have compassion on you. But you were thrown out into the open field, because your life was despised in the day that you were born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to you in your blood, Live!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have caused you to multiply like the bud of the field, and you are grown, and you are great; and you come [in] the finest ornaments. [Your] breasts are formed, and hair is grown, yet you [were] naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I passed by you and looked on you, and, behold, your time [was] the time of love. And I spread my skirt over you and covered your nakedness. And I swore to you and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord Jehovah. And you became Mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I washed you with water; I washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I also clothed you [with] embroidered work, and I shod you [with] dugong [sandals]. And I wrapped you in fine linen, and I covered you [with] silk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I adorned you [with] ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands and a chain on your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you were adorned with gold and silver; and your clothing [was of] fine linen and silk and embroidered work. You ate fine flour and honey and oil; and you were exceedingly beautiful. And you advanced to regal estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And your name went out among the nations, because of your beauty; for it [was] perfect in My beauty, which I had put on you, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But you trusted in your beauty, and played the harlot because of your name, and poured out your fornications on all who passed by; it was his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you took from your clothes and adorned your high places with different colors, and fornicated on them, [such as] had not come, nor shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you have taken beautiful things of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made images of males, and fornicated with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And [you] took your embroidered dresses and covered them, and you have given to their face My oil and My incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also My food which I gave you, fine flour and oil and honey [with which] I fed you, you have given it to their face for a soothing aroma. And it happened, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to Me, and you gave these to them for food. [Are] your fornications small?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have slaughtered My sons and gave them to cause these to pass through [the fire] for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all your hateful deeds and your fornications you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, [and] squirming in your blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe, woe to you says the Lord Jehovah! [For] it happened after all your evil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[that] you have also built yourself a mound, and you have made yourself a high place in every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You have built your high place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty to be despised, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and have multiplied your fornications.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You have also whored with the Egyptians, your neighbors great of flesh, and have multiplied your fornications to provoke Me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, behold, therefore I have stretched out My hand over you, and drew back your portion. And I gave you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your wicked way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have whored with the Assyrians, without your being satisfied; yea, you whored and yet you were not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And your whoredom is idolatry in the land of Canaan, [to the] Chaldean, and yet you were not satisfied with this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How weak is your heart, says the Lord Jehovah, since you do all these, the work of a woman, an overbearing harlot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>in that you build your mound at the head of every way, and make your high place in every street. Yet you have not been as a harlot, scorning wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>[Like] the adulterous wife, instead of her husband, she takes strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They give a gift to all harlots, but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them to come to you from all around, for your fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And in you was the opposite from [those] women in your fornications, since no one whores after you, and in your giving wages, and hire is not given to you. [In] this you are opposite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore, O harlot, hear the Word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness was bared in your fornications with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your sons whom you gave to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>behold, therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have been pleased, even all [whom] you loved, with all whom you have hated; I will even gather them against you from all around, and will uncover your nakedness to them, and they will see all your nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will judge you with judgments of adulteresses, and with shedders of blood. And I will give you blood and fury and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will also give you into their hand, and they will tear down your mound, and will demolish your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, and shall take your beautiful things, and leave you naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall also raise a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and cut you with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. And I will make you stop whoring; and also, you shall not give hire again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I will make My fury to rest against you, and My jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet and will be angry no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have troubled Me in all these [things]; so, behold, I will also repay your way on [your] head, says the Lord Jehovah. And you shall not commit this wickedness above all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, all who use proverbs shall use [this] proverb against you, saying, As the mother, [so is] her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You [are] your mother's daughter, who despises her husband and her sons. And you [are] the sister of your sisters, who despise their husbands and their sons. Your mother [was] a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And your older sister [is] Samaria, she and her daughters who dwell at your left hand. And your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, [is] Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet you have not walked according to their ways, nor done according to their hateful deeds; but, as [if it were] a very little [thing], you were corrupted more than they were in all your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>[As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, Sodom your sister, she nor her daughters, has not done as you have done, you and your daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom; pride. Fullness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters. Nor did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they were haughty and did abominable things before Me, so I turned away as I saw [fit].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Nor has Samaria sinned [as much] as half your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters in all your abominations which you have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>You also, who have judged your sisters, bear your own shame for your sins which you have committed more abominable than they. They are more righteous than you! Yes, blush and bear your shame, since you have justified your sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I shall return their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then [also] the captivity of your captivity in their midst;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>that you may bear your shame, and blush in all that you have done, since you are a comfort to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, then you and your daughters shall return to your former state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of [your] reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all her neighbors, the daughters of the Philistines who hated you from all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>You are bearing your wickedness and your abominations, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For so says the Lord Jehovah: I will even deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And you shall remember your ways and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your older and your younger. And I will give them to you for daughters, but not by [your] covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>so that you may remember and be ashamed; and it will not be [possible] to open [your] mouth any more because of your shame; in that I am propitiated for all that you have done, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
