And the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell on me there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I looked, and behold! A likeness as the look of fire; from the appearance of His loins and downward, [like] fire. And from His loins and upward as the look of brightness, like the color of polished bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He put out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head. And the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the opening of the inner gate facing north, where there [was] a seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, behold! The glory of the God of Israel [was] there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now to the way of the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward at the gate of the altar the image of jealousy [was] at the entrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they do; even the great abominations which the house of Israel is doing here, that I should go far off from My sanctuary? But turn again, [and] you shall see greater abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He brought me to the opening of the court; and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He said to me, Son of man, dig in the wall now. And I dug in the wall, and, behold, an opening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me. Go in and see the evil abominations that they do here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I went in and saw. And behold, every kind of creeping thing, and hateful beast, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were carved on the wall all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, standing among them, these were before them, and each man with his censor in his hand. And the odor of the cloud of incense was rising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each man in his image room? For they are saying, The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He also said to me, You turn again, [and] you shall see greater evils that they are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He brought me to the opening of the gate of the LORD's house, toward the north. And behold, women were sitting there, weeping for Tammuz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He said to me, Have you seen, O son of man? Turn yet again, [and] you shall see greater evils than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and behold, at the opening of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, [were] about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they bowed themselves eastward to the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He said to me, Have you seen, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they do the hateful things which they do here? For they have filled the land with violence and have turned to provoke Me to anger. And lo, they put the branch to their nose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will also deal with fury; My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in My ears [with] a loud voice, I will not hear them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
