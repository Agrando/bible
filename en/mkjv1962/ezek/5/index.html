Then take scales to weigh, and divide the [hair].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You shall burn a third part with fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you shall take a third part [and] beat around it with a sword; and you shall scatter a third part in the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Also you shall take a few of them in number, and tie them up in your skirts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then take of them again, and throw them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for a fire shall come forth from them into all the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: This [is] Jerusalem. I have set it in the middle of the nations, and all around her [are] the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she has changed My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and [defiled] My laws more than the countries that [are] all around her; for they have rejected My judgments and My laws; they have not walked in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you multiplied more than the nations that [are] all around you, [and] have not walked in My laws, neither have kept My judgments, nor have done according to the judgments of the nations all around you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>therefore so says the Lord Jehovah; Behold, I, even I, [am] against you, and will carry out judgments in your midst before the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will do in you that which I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the fathers shall eat the sons in your midst, and the sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments in you, and I will scatter the whole remnant of you into all the winds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also withdraw; nor shall My eye spare you, nor will I have any pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A third part of you shall die with the plague, and shall be consumed with the famine in your midst. And a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So My anger shall be fulfilled, and I will cause My fury to rest on them, and I will be comforted. And they shall know that I the LORD have spoken [it] in My zeal, when I have fulfilled My fury in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make you a waste and a curse among the nations that [are] all around you, in the sight of all who pass by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an chastening and a horror to the nations which [are] all around you, when I shall execute judgments against you in anger and in fury and in rebukes [among them]. I the LORD have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for [their] ruin, which I will send to destroy you; even I will increase the famine on you, and break your staff of bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yea, I will send on you famine and evil beasts, and you will be bereaved. And pestilence and blood shall pass among you; and I shall bring a sword on you. I the LORD have spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
