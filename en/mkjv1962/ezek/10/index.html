In the expanse over the head of the cherubs appeared the look of the form of a throne, like a sapphire stone, above them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And He spoke to the man clothed [with] linen, and said, Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter [them] on the city. And he went in before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the cherubs were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the glory of the LORD rose from the cherub, over the threshold of the house. And the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sound of the cherubs' wings was heard over the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when He speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it happened when He had commanded the man clothed [with] linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubs; he went in then and stood beside the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubs to the fire between the cherubs, and he lifted it and put [it] into the hands of the one clothed with linen. And he took [it] and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the form of a man's hand was seen under the wings of the cherubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I looked, and behold, the four wheels [were] beside the cherubs, one wheel was by one cherub, and another wheel by one cherub; and the wheels looked like the color of a stone of Tarshish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And their appearance was as one, the four of them, as if the wheel were in the midst of the wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they went, they went on their four sides. They did not turn as they went, for to the place where the head faces, after it they went. They did not turn as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels [were] full of eyes all around, [even] their wheels that the four of them had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the wheels, it was cried to them in my hearing, Whirling wheel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And four faces were to each one. The first face [was] the face of a cherub, and the second face [was] the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the cherubs rose up. This [is] the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the cherubs went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubs lifted their wings to soar from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them, even they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they stood still, [these] stood still, and when they rose up, [these] lifted up. For the spirit of the living creature [was] in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the glory of the LORD went from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the cherubs lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels also [were] beside them. And he stood at the door of the eastern gate of the LORD's house. And the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This [is] the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they [were] cherubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Four, [even] four faces [are] to each; and four wings to each. And the form of a man's hands [was] under their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the form of their faces, they [are] the faces that I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances even theirs.
