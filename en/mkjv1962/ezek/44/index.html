And it [was] shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the LORD said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it. Because Jehovah, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>[It is] for the ruler; the ruler shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD. He shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And He brought me by the way of the north gate before the house. And I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. And I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD said to me, Son of man, note carefully: see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all its laws. And set your heart to the entrance of the house, with all the exits of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, This says the Lord Jehovah: O house of Israel, let it be more than enough for you, of all your hateful deeds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>that you have brought strangers, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to profane it, [even] My house, when you offer My bread, the fat and the blood. And they have broken My covenant because of all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you have not kept the charge of My holy things, but you have set keepers of My charge in My sanctuary for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: No son of an alien, uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh, shall enter into My sanctuary, or any son of an alien among the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the Levites who have gone far away from Me, when Israel went astray; those who went astray from Me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, overseers at the gates of the house and ministering to the house. They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore I have lifted up My hand against them, says the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they shall not come near Me, to do the office of a priest to Me, nor to come near any of My holy things, in the most holy place; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all its service, and for all that shall be done in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near Me to minister to Me, and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table, to minister to Me, and they shall keep My charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall be, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with bleached [linen] clothing. And no wool shall come on them while they serve in the gates of the inner court, and inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Turbans of bleached [linen] shall be on their heads, and shall have bleached [linen] undergarments on their loins. They shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court of the people, they shall put off their clothes in which they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers. And they shall put on other clothes, so that they shall not sanctify the people with their own clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nor shall they shave their heads nor allow their hair to grow long; they shall only trim their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And every priest shall not drink wine when they enter the inner court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nor shall they take for their wives a widow nor her who is put away. But they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow who had a priest before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall teach My people to discern between the holy and common, and between the unclean and the clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in a dispute they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to My judgments. And they shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My assemblies, and they shall keep My sabbaths holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he shall not come near any dead person to defile [himself;] but he may defile themselves for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister who has had no husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, to the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall be to them for an inheritance. I [am] their inheritance. And you shall give them no possession in Israel; I [am] their possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They shall eat the food offering, and the sin offering, and the guilt offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the first of all the firstfruits of all, and every offering of all, of every [kind] of your sacrifices, shall be the priest's. You shall also give the priest the first of your dough, so that he may cause the blessing to rest in your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The priests shall not eat of anything that died of itself, or is torn, whether it is bird or animal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
