Also set the camp against it, and set [battering] rams against it all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And take an iron griddle to yourself, and set it [for] a wall of iron between you and the city. And set your face against it, and it shall be under attack. And you shall set a battle against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Also lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; [according] to the number of days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when you have fulfilled them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days; a day for a year; a day for a year, I have set for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and your arm [shall be] uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, behold, I will lay bands on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to [another] until you have ended the days of your siege.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Take also to yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. [According] to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And your food which you shall eat [shall be] by weight twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall also drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin.

And they shall eat bread by weight, and with care. And they shall drink water by measure, and in silence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that they may lack bread and water, and be stricken dumb with one another, and waste away in their iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
