And His voice [was] like the sound of many waters. And the earth shone with His glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it looked the same as the vision which I saw, even according to the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. And the visions [were] like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar. And I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose view is eastward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner chamber. And behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard [Him] speaking to me from the house. And standing by me [was] a Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He said to me, Son of man, the house of Israel shall no more defile the place of My throne, and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever; neither they, nor their kings, by their fornication, nor by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In their setting of their doorstep by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost; and the wall between Me and them, they have even defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have done. And I have consumed them in My anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now [let] them put away their fornication, and the dead bodies of their kings from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You, son of man, declare [to] the house of Israel, the [temple] house, so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. And let them measure [its] size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, the form of the house, and its arrangement, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its statutes, and all its forms, and all its laws, make known to them. And write them before their eyes, so that they may observe all its form, and all its statutes, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This [is] the law of the house. On the top of the mountain [is] all its border, all around, most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these are the measures of the altar by the cubit. The cubit [is] a cubit and a span; even the base [shall be] a cubit, and the width a cubit, and its border by its edge all around  shall be] a span. And this [is the upper part of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And from the base on the ground even to the lower ledge [shall be] two cubits, and the width one cubit. And from the smaller ledge even to the greater ledge [shall be] four cubits, and the width one cubit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the altar hearth [shall be] four cubits, and from the altar hearth and upward [shall be] four horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the altar hearth [shall be] twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square in its four sides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the ledge [shall be] fourteen long and fourteen wide in its four sides. And the border around it [shall be] half a cubit, and its base a cubit around. And its steps shall face eastward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said to me, Son of man, so says the Lord Jehovah: These [are] the statutes of the altar in the day of its being made to offer on it burnt offerings, and to sprinkle blood on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests the Levites, who [are] of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to minister to Me, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall take of its blood and put [it] on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around. So you shall cleanse and purge it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and he shall burn [it] in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And on the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering. And they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed it with the bull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Every day [for] seven days you shall prepare a goat [for] a sin offering. They also shall prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Seven days they shall purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate [themselves].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when these days are expired, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings before the altar, and your peace offerings. And I will accept you, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
