And the hand of the LORD was on him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I looked, and behold, a windstorm came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire flashing itself, and a brightness to it all around, and out of its midst, like the color of polished bronze out of the middle of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also out of its midst [came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] how they looked; they had the likeness of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And four faces [were] to each, and four wings to each.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like the color of burnished copper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the [hands] of a man [extended] from under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them [had] their faces and their wings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>joining each one to the other [by] their wings. They did not turn in their going; each one went toward the front of their face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the likeness of their faces: the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right [side] to the four of them; and the face of an ox on the left side to the four of them; and the face of an eagle to the four of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So their faces [were]. And their wings [were] stretched upward; to each, the two [wings] of each one were joined; and two [wings] covered their bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And each went toward the front of their faces. To where the spirit was to go, there they went; they did not turn in their going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the likeness of the living creatures: they looked like burning coals of fire; like the appearance of torches. It was continually circling among the living creatures. And the fire [was] bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the living creatures kept running and returning, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I looked at the living creatures, behold, one wheel [was] on the earth by the living creatures, with its four faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship [was] the color of beryl, and the four of them had one likeness. And their appearance and their workmanship [was] like a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they went, they went on their four sides; [and] they did not turn when they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And their rims: they [were] even high; they were even awesome. And their rims [were] full of eyes all around the four of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels went beside them; and in the lifting up of the living creatures from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherever the spirit was to go, there they went; there the spirit [was] to go, and the wheels were lifted up along with them. For the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In their going, [these] went; and in their standing still, these stood still. And in their lifting up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them. For the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And there [was] a likeness over the heads of the living creature; an expanse, like the color of awesome crystal stretched out over their heads from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And under the expanse their wings [were] straight, the one toward the other. Each one had two [wings] covering on this [side], and to each two covering on that [side of] their bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, in their going [was] the sound of tumult, like the sound of an army. In their standing still, they let down their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there was a voice from the expanse which [was] over their heads, in their standing still, and they let down their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And from above the expanse that [was] over their heads [was] a likeness like a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne. And on the likeness of the throne [was] a likeness looking like a man on it from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I saw [Him] looking like the color of polished bronze, looking like fire all around within it. From the likeness of His loins even upward, and from the likeness of His loins even downward, I saw [Him], looking like fire, and it had brightness all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain looks, so the brightness all around looked. This was how the likeness of the glory of the LORD looked. And I saw. And I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
