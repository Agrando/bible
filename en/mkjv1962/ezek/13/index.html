And say to those who prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear the Word of Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have not gone up into the breaks, nor built the wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD says. And the LORD has not sent them; but they hoped to confirm [their] word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Did you not see a vain vision, and speak a lying divination? Yet you say, The LORD says; although I have not spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have spoken vanity and seen a lie, therefore, behold, I [am] against you, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And My hand shall be against the prophets who see vanity and who divine a lie. They shall not be in the council of My people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because, even because they made My people go astray, saying, Peace; and [there was] no peace; and he builds a wall, and lo, [others] daubed it with lime.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Say to those who daub [with] lime, yes, it shall fall; [there] will be a flooding rain; and you, O hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind will break.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, behold, when the wall has fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where [is] the daubing with which you have daubed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: I will even break [it with] a stormy wind in My fury. And there shall be an flooding rain in My anger, and hailstones in fury to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will break down the wall that you have daubed [with] lime, and touch it to the ground; yea, I will bare its base. And it shall fall, and you shall be destroyed in her midst; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will fulfill My wrath on the wall and on those who daubed it [with] lime. And I will say to you, The wall [is] no more; and, Those who daubed [are] no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and [there is] no peace, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart. And prophesy against them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to those sewing bands to all joints of my hands, and make long veils for the head of every [man] of stature, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and will you save alive the souls for yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls that should not die; and to save alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against your bands with which you are hunting the souls there, to make them fly. And I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, the souls which you are hunting, to make them fly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also I will tear your long veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because with lies you have saddened the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and have made the hands of the wicked strong, so that he should not turn from his wicked way, by promising him life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>therefore you shall not see vanity, and you shall not divine any divination. and I will deliver My people out of your hands; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
