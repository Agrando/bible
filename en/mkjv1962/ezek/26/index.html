She is shattered, the doors of the peoples, she has turned to me; I shall be filled; she is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I [am] against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, [as] the sea causes its waves to come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her and make her like a shining rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It shall be a spreading place of nets in the middle of the sea. For I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah. And it shall become a spoil to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her daughters who [are] in the field shall be killed by the sword; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon on Tyre, a king of kings from the north, with horses and with chariots and with a company of horsemen, and many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He shall kill your daughters with the sword in the field. And he shall make siege walls against you, and pour out a siege mound against you, and lift up the shield against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because of his many horses, their dust shall cover you. Your walls shall shake at the sound of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your gates, as [men] enter a city that is breached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>With the hoofs of his horses he shall trample all your streets. He shall kill your people by the sword, and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they shall plunder your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise. And they shall break down your walls and destroy your desirable houses. And they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be heard no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make you like a shining rock. You shall be [a place] to spread nets on; you shall be built no more; for I the LORD have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So says the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Shall not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, when the slain groan, when the slaughter is made in your midst?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And all the rulers of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their embroidered garments. They shall clothe themselves [with] trembling; they shall sit on the ground and tremble at [every moment, and be amazed at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they shall take up a mourning for you, and say to you, How you who lived by the sea are destroyed, the famous city which was strong in the sea, she and her people who caused their terror [to be] on all who lived in it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the coastlands shall tremble in the day of your fall; yea, the coastlands by the sea shall be troubled at your going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For so says the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make you a ruined city, like the cities that have no inhabitants; when I shall bring up the deep on you, and great waters shall cover you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>when I shall bring you down with those who go down into the Pit, with the people of old time, and shall set you in the low parts of the earth, in places ruined in days of old, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you have no inhabitants (but I gave glory in the land of the living)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will give you terrors, and you [will] not [be]. Though you are sought, yet you shall never be found forever says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
