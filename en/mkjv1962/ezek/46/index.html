But on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the ruler shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate outside, and shall stand by the gatepost. And the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. And he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the people of the land shall worship [at] the door of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and in the new moons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the burnt offering that the ruler shall offer to the LORD in the sabbath day [shall be] six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the food offering [shall be] an ephah for a ram, and the food offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in the day of the new moon [it shall be] a bull without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram. They shall be without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he shall prepare a food offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as his hand shall be able to get, and a hin of oil to an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when the ruler shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and by its way he shall go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when the people of the land come before the LORD in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate. And he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate. He shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall leave opposite it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the ruler shall go in among them when they go in. And when they go out, he shall go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in the feasts and in the appointed feasts the food offering shall be an ephah to a bull, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the ruler shall prepare a free-will burnt offering or peace offerings willingly to the LORD, [one] shall then open to him the gate that faces eastward, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the Sabbath day. And he shall go out. And after his going out, one shall shut the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall daily prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, a lamb without blemish, a son of a year. You shall prepare it every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall prepare a food offering for it every morning, the sixth of an ephah, and the third of a hin of oil, to make the fine flour moist; a food offering every day by an ordinance forever to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they shall prepare the lamb, and the food offering, and the oil, every morning for a burnt offering continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: If the ruler gives a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance of it shall be his sons'; it [shall be] their possession by inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty. Afterwards. it shall return to the ruler, but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the ruler shall not take of the people's inheritance, oppressing them out of their possession. But he shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own possession; so that My people may not be scattered, each man from his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he brought me through the entry which [was] at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, facing north. And behold, there [was] a place on the two sides westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the food offering, so that they may not bear [them] out into the outer court to sanctify the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he led me out into the outer court and he made me pass by the four corners of the court. And behold, in every corner of the court there [was] a court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the four corners of the court [were] enclosed courts, forty [cubits] long and thirty wide, one measure to the four of them, being made in corners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And a row [was] all around in them, all around the four of them. And boiling water [was] made under the rows all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to me, These [are] the places of those who boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
