And he brought me into the chamber that [was] across from the separate place and which [was] in front of the building to the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Before the length of a hundred cubits [was] the north door, and the width [was] fifty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Across from the twenty cubits which [were] for the inner court, and across from the pavement which [was] for the outer court, gallery [was] on gallery in three stories.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And before the chambers [was] a walk of ten cubits width inward, a way of one cubit. And their doors [were] northward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the upper chambers [were] shorter; for the galleries used up more space than the lower and middle ones in the building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For they [were] in three [stories], but there [were] no columns to them like the columns of the courts. So [the third] story was made narrower than the lower and the middle stories from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the wall that [was] outside near the chambers, toward the outer court on the front of the chambers, its length [was] fifty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the length of the chambers that [were] in the outer court [was] fifty cubits. And lo, in front of the temple [was] a hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And under these chambers [was] the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>in the width of the wall of the court eastward, to the front of the separate area, and to the front of the building [were] chambers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the way in front of them looked like the chambers which [were] northward, as their length, so their width. And all their exits [were] as their patterns, and as their doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as the doors of the chambers that [were] southward [was] a door in the head of the way, [even] the way directly in front of the wall eastward, as one enters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to me, The north chambers [and] the south chambers which [are] in front of the separate place, they [are] holy chambers, where the priests shall eat, [those] who approach to the LORD shall eat the most holy [things]. There they shall lay the most holy things, and the food offering, and the sin offering, and the guilt offering. For the place [is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the priests enter, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but they shall lay their clothes there by which they minister in them, for they are holy. And they shall put on other clothes, and shall approach that which is for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he finished measuring the inner house; he brought me out the way of the gate whose view is eastward, and measured all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed, all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He measured the north side, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He measured the south side, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He turned to the west side, measuring five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He measured it by the four sides. It had a wall all around, five hundred long, and five hundred wide, to make a separation between the holy place and the common place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
