Since you have not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I will make Mount Seir a ruin, and cut off from it the one passing through, and the one returning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will fill his mountains [with] his dead. [In] your hills, and your valleys, and all your rivers, those slain with the sword shall fall in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will make you ruins forever, and your cities shall not be inhabited. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because you have said, These two nations and these two lands shall be mine, and we shall possess it; yet the LORD was there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>therefore, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will act by your anger and by your envy which you have shown out of your hatred against them. And I will make Myself known among them when I have judged you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall know that I [am] the LORD. I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, Desolation! They are given to us for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So with your mouth you have boasted against Me, and have multiplied your words against Me. I have heard [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you a ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As you rejoiced at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, so I will do to you. You shall be a desolation, O Mount Seir and all Idumea, even all of it. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
