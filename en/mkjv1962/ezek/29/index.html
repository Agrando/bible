You shall fall on the open fields; you shall not be removed nor gathered. I have given you for food to the beasts of the field and to the birds of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all the people of Egypt shall know that I [am] the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When they took you by your hand, you broke and tore off all their shoulder. And when they leaned on you, you shattered and made all their loins stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and cut off man and beast from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the land of Egypt shall be a desert and waste; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, because he has said, The river [is] mine, and I have made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, and therefore I [am] against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt a complete waste, a ruin, from Migdol [to] Syene, even to the border of Ethiopia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, and you shall not live in it forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the land of Egypt a ruin in the midst of the ruined lands; and her cities shall be deserted forty years among the cities [that are] laid waste. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will scatter them through the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet so says the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return [to] the land of Pathros, into their homeland. And they shall be a low kingdom there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It shall be the lowest of the kingdoms, and shall no more exalt itself above the nations. For I will make them so few, that they shall no more rule over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall never again be the hope of the house of Israel, recalling the iniquity of their turning after them. And they shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened in the twenty-seventh year, in the first [month], in the first of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre. Every head [was] made bald, and every shoulder was peeled. Yet neither he nor his army had any pay for Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he shall take her host, and take her spoil, and seize her plunder. And it shall be the wages for his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have given him the land of Egypt [for] his labor with which he served against it, because they worked for Me, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that day I will make a horn spring up to the house of Israel, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
