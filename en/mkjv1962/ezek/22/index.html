And you shall make her know all her abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And you shall say, So says the Lord Jehovah: The city sheds blood in her midst that her time may come, and makes idols against herself to defile [herself].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are guilty in your blood that you have shed; and you have defiled yourself in your idols you have made. And your days [are] brought near, and have come to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[Those who are] near and [those] far from you shall mock against you, O defiled of name, abounding in tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, the rulers of Israel, each man by his might, have been in you in order to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In you they have despised father and mother. In your midst they have dealt with the stranger by oppression. In you they oppressed the orphan and the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You have despised My holy things, and have profaned My sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In you are men of slander to shed blood; and in you they eat on the mountains; in your midst they do unchaste acts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In you they have uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in you they have humbled her defiled by impurity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And a man has done abomination with his neighbor's wife; and a man has defiled his daughter-in-law in unchaste acts; and a man has humbled within you his sister, his father's daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In you they have taken bribes to shed blood. You have taken usury and increase, and you gained by extortion of your neighbors, and you have forgotten Me, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And behold, I have struck My palm against your unjust gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Can your heart stand, or can your hands be strong, in the day that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and [I] will act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you in the lands, and will destroy your uncleanness out of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you will be profaned in you before the eyes of the nations, and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me. All of them [are] bronze, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the middle of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the middle of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[As they] gather silver, and bronze, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it to melt [it], so I will gather [you] in My anger and in My fury, and I will leave [you there] and melt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will gather you and blow on you in the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in the middle of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so you shall be melted in the middle of it; and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out My fury on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Son of man, say to her: You [are] a land not being cleansed, nor rained on in the day of disgust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>A plot [by] her prophets [is] in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they multiplied her many widows in her midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Her priests have broken My law and have defiled My holy things. They have put no difference between the holy and the common, and have not taught between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from My sabbaths, and I am defiled among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Her rulers in her midst [are] like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood and to destroy souls, to get unjust gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And her prophets have daubed themselves [with] lime, seeing vanity and divining lies to them, saying, So says the Lord Jehovah; when the LORD has not spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The people of the land have used oppression and practiced robbery, and they have troubled the poor and needy. Yea, [they] have oppressed the stranger without right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I sought for a man among them who should wall up a wall for the land, and stand in the break before me, that I should not destroy it. But I did not find one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I have poured out My fury on them. I have burned them up with the fire of My wrath. I have given their way on their heads, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
