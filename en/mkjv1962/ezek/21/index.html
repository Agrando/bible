It shall not return any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you, son of man, groan with the breaking of [your] loins; and groan with bitterness before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it will be when they say to you, Why do you groan? You shall answer, Because of the news [that] it is coming; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak  as] water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Son of man, prophesy and say, So says the LORD. Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It is sharpened in order to slaughter; it is polished so that there may be a flash to it. Or shall we rejoice? You are despising the rod of My son, [as if it were] every tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He has given it to be polished, to be taken by the hand. The sword, it is sharpened, and it it polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Cry and howl, son of man; for it [shall be] on My people; it [shall be] on all the rulers of Israel. They are thrown to the sword with My people; Therefore slap [your] thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because [it is] a trial, and what if even the despising rod shall not be? says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you, son of man, prophesy and strike [your] hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain. It [is] the sword of the slain, the great one that surrounds them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that [their] heart may melt, and many stumble at all [their] gates. I have given the threatening sword. Ah! It is made like lightning; it is wrapped for a slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Sharpen yourself on the right! Set yourself on the left, wherever your face is set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And also I, I will also strike My hands together, and I will cause My fury to rest. I the LORD have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Word of the LORD came to me again, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you, son of man, set for yourself two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. Both of them shall come out of one land. And create a hand at the head of the way to the city; create it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall set a way that the sword may enter [into] Rabbah of the Ammonites, and [into] Judah, into fortified Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the king of Babylon shall stand at the parting of the way, at the head of the two highways, to practice divination. He shall shake arrows; he shall ask household idols; he shall look at the liver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>At his right shall be the divining [for] Jerusalem, to set [battering] rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering-rams against the gates, to pour out and to build a siege wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall be to them an empty divining before their eyes, those who have sworn oaths to them. But He will remember iniquity, that they may be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, in that your sins are revealed in all your deeds; because you have been remembered, you shall be taken with the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you, O slain, wicked king of Israel, of whom has come his day in the time of iniquity of the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: Remove the diadem, and take off the crown. This [shall] not [be] as it was. Lift up the low one, and put down the high one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ruin, ruin, ruin, I will appoint it. Also this shall not be until the coming of Him whose is the right. And I will give it to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you, son of man, prophesy and say, So says the Lord Jehovah concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their shame. Even say: The sword, the sword [is] drawn, polished for slaughter to make an end, that [it may be] like lightning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>while they see false visions for you, while they divine a lie to you, to put you on the necks of the slain of the wicked whose day has come in the day of iniquity; [it shall have] an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will pour out My disgust on you; with the fire of My wrath I will blow against you, and give you into the hand of burning men, able to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You shall be for food to the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall be remembered no [more]; for I the LORD have spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
