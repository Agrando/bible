So says the Lord Jehovah: Because you said, Aha, against My sanctuary when it was defiled, and against the land of Israel when it was ruined, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>therefore, behold, I will give you to the sons of the east for a possession. And they shall set their camp sites among you, and put among you their dwellings. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will make Rabbah a pasture [for] camels, and the Ammonites a crouching-place [for] flocks. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have clapped [your] hands and stamped the foot, and rejoiced in heart with all your spite against the land of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>behold, therefore I will stretch out My hand on you, and will give you as a prize to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the lands. I will destroy you, and you shall know that I [am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab and Seir say, Behold, the house of Judah [is] like all the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities, from his borders, the glory of the land, even Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to the men of the east with the Ammonites. And I will give them in possession so that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will execute judgments on Moab; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended and revenged himself on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: I will also stretch out My hand on Edom, and will cut man and beast off from it; and I will make it a waste from Teman, even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel. And they shall do in Edom according to My anger and according to My fury. And they shall know My vengeance, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So says the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have taken vengeance; yes, have taken vengeance with spite in [their] soul, to destroy [with] never-ending enmity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will stretch out My hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and will destroy the rest of the sea coast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will execute great vengeance on them with rebukes; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
