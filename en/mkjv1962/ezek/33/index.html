His blood shall be on himself. But he who takes warning shall deliver his soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if the watchman sees the sword coming, and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned; if the sword comes and takes [any] person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity. But I will require his blood at the watchman's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore you shall hear the Word from My mouth, and warn them from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die; if you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked one shall die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But, if you warn the wicked of his way, to turn from it; if he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you, son of man, speak to the house of Israel. So you have spoken, saying, When our transgressions and our sins [are] on us, and we are wasting away in them, How then shall we live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Say to them: [As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I have no delight in the death of the wicked, except in the turning of the wicked from his way, and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, son of man, say to the sons of your people: The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression. As for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it in the day he turns from his wickedness. Nor shall the righteous be able to live for his [righteousness] in the day that he sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When I shall say to the righteous [that] he shall surely live; if he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he has committed, he shall die for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; if he turns from his sin and does justice and right;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[if] the wicked gives back the pledge, gives again what he had robbed, walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, then he shall surely live; he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>None of his sins that he has committed shall be called to his memory. He has done justice and right; he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet the sons of your people say, The way of the Lord is not fair. But as for them, their way is not fair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall even die by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But if the wicked turns from his wickedness and does justice and right, he shall live by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, I will judge you, each one according to his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it was in the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth [month], on the fifth of the month, one who escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD's hand was on me in the evening, before he who had escaped came. And He had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was dumb no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Son of man, those who live in those wastes of the land of Israel are speaking, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land. But we [are] many; the land is given to us for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; and shall you possess the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You stand on your sword, you work abomination, each defiling his neighbor's wife. And shall you possess the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Speak to them in this way, So says the Lord Jehovah: [As] I live, surely those who [are] in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and I will give him who [is] in the open field to the beasts to be eaten up, and those in the forts and in the caves shall die of the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I have made the land a ruin, and the pride of her strength has ceased. And the mountains of Israel shall be a waste, so that none shall pass through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have made the land a ruin because of all their abominations which they have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you, son of man, the sons of your people are still talking about you by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and speaking to one another, each man to his brother, saying, I pray you, come and hear what is the word which comes from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they come to you as the people come, and they sit before you [as] My people, and they hear your words. But they will not do them. For with their mouth they show much love, [but] their heart goes after their unjust gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And lo, you [are] to them as a singer of love songs [with] a beautiful voice, and able to play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this happens; lo, it will come; then they shall know that a prophet has been among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
