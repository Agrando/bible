And he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he went inside and measured the pillar of the door, two cubits; and the door [was] six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple. And he said to me, This [is] the Holy of Holies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of each side room [was] four cubits, all around the house on [every] side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the side chambers [were] a side chamber over a side chamber, three stories, and thirty times. And [they] entered the wall of the house for the side chambers all around, that they might be fastened, for they [were] not fastened to the wall of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there [was] a widening, and a winding upwards [and] upwards to the side chambers. For the winding around of the house went upward [and] upward, all around the house. On account of this the width of the house went upward, and so from the lowest it went up to the highest by the middle [story].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I also saw the height of the house all around. The foundations of the side rooms [were] a full reed, six large cubits by joining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The width of the wall, which [was] for the side chamber to the outside, [was] five cubits, and what [was] left between the side chambers that [were] of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And between the chambers [was] the width of twenty cubits, circling the house all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the door of the side chamber [was] toward the open space, one door northward and one door southward. And the width of the place of the open space [was] five cubits all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the building that [was] before the separate place at the end of the way of the west [was] seventy cubits wide. And the wall of the building [was] five cubits wide all around, and its length, ninety cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he measured the house, a hundred cubits long. And the separate place, and the building, and its wall, [were] a hundred cubits long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the width of the front of the house and of the separate place eastward [was] a hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he measured the length of the building to the front of the separate place which [was] behind it; and its gallery from here and from there, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple and the porches of the court,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the thresholds, and the latticed narrow windows, and the galleries all around, their three stories across from the threshold, with wood panelings all around, and [from] the ground up to the windows; and the windows [were] covered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>to that above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall around inside and outside, by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it [was] made with cherubs and palm trees, and a palm tree [was] between cherub and cherub. And each cherub had two faces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the face of a man [was] toward the palm tree from here, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree from there. It [was] made through all the house all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From the ground to above the door [were] cherubs and palm trees made, and [on] the wall of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The temple doorposts [were] squared, and the face of the sanctuary. The looks of the one was like the looks of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The altar of wood [was] three cubits high, and its length two cubits. And its corners, and its length, and its walls, [were] of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And two doors [leaves] [were] to [each] of the doors, two turning doors, two for the one door, and two for the other door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And on them, on the temple doors, [were] made cherubs and palm trees like those made on the walls, and thick wood on the face of the porch outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And latticed windows, and palm trees, [were] from here and from there, on the sides of the porch, and on the side chambers of the house, and wooden [canopies].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
