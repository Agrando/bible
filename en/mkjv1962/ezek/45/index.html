The length [shall be] twenty-five thousand [cubits long, and the width ten thousand. It shall be holy in all its borders all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Of this there shall be five hundred by five hundred cubits for the sanctuary, square all around; and fifty cubits around shall be for its open space.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And from this measure you shall measure the length of twenty-five thousand, and the width of ten thousand. And in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It is the holy [portion] of the land for the priests, it shall be for the ministers of the sanctuary who come near to minister to the LORD. And it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the twenty-five thousand cubits in length, and the ten thousand in width, shall also be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, for themselves for a possession, twenty rooms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall give the possession of the city, five thousand [cubits] wide, and twenty-five thousand long, beside the offering of the holy [portion].
