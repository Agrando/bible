Should I at all be inquired of by them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore speak to them, and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him in it by the host of his idols;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>so that I may capture the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are estranged from Me by their idols, all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore say to the house of Israel, So says the Lord Jehovah: Repent and turn from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger who lives in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to ask of him concerning Me; I the LORD will answer him Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will set My face against that man, and I will make him desolate for a sign and for proverbs. And I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the prophet, if he is deceived, and he speaks a word, I the LORD have deceived that prophet. And I will stretch out My hand on him and will destroy him in the midst of My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall bear their iniquity. As the iniquity of the inquirer, so the iniquity of the prophet shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So that the house of Israel may never again go astray from Me, nor be defiled again with all their transgressions, but they are to Me My people, and I will be to them for God, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Word of the LORD came again to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Son of man, when a land sins against Me by traitorous betraying, then I will stretch out My hand on it, and will break the staff of its bread, and will send famine on it, and will cut off man and beast from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And [though] these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver [only] their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I cause destroying beasts to come through the land, and they spoil it so that it is deserted, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[though] these three men were in its midst, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters. They only shall be delivered, but the land shall be deserted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Or [if] I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>though these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they [only] shall be delivered themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or [if] I send a plague into that land, and pour out My fury on it in blood, to cut off man and beast from it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>though Noah, Daniel, and Job [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter. They shall [only] deliver their own souls by their righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For so says the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send My four evil judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the destroying beast, and the plague, to cut off man and beast from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant in it that shall be brought out, sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come out to you, and you shall see their way and their doings. And you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I brought on Jerusalem, [for] all that I have brought on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall comfort you when you see their way and their doings. And you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
