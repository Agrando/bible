Then whoever first stepped in after the troubling of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Jesus saw him lying, and knowing that he had spent much time, He said to him, Do you desire to be made whole?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The infirm man answered Him, Sir, when the water is troubled, I have no one to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another steps down before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus says to him, Rise, take up your bed and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked. And it was a sabbath on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore the Jews said to him who had been healed, It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for you to take up the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them, He who made me whole said to me, Take up your bed and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he did not know Him who had cured him, for Jesus had moved away, a crowd being in the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you are made whole. Sin no more lest a worse thing come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then, because of this, the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was His father, making Himself equal with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself but what He sees the Father do. For whatever things He does, these also the Son does likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all the things that He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these, so that you may marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raises the dead and makes alive, even so the Son of man makes alive whomever He wills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>so that all should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes on Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they who hear shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to the Son to have life within Himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is [the] Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do not marvel at this, for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves shall hear His voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and shall come forth, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil to the resurrection of condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can do nothing of My own self. As I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of [the] Father who has sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things I say so that you might be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a burning and shining light, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have greater witness than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me that I should finish them, the works which I do themselves witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He sending Me, the Father Himself, has borne witness of Me. Neither have you heard His voice at any time nor seen His shape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you do not have His Word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He has sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life. And they are the ones witnessing of Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and you will not come to Me that you might have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I do not receive honor from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me. If another shall come in [his] own name, him you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe, [you who] receive honor from one another and do not seek the honor that [comes] from God only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is [one] who accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe My words?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
