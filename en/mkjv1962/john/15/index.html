And every one that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bring forth more fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now you are clean through the Word which I have spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither [can] you unless you abide in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the Vine, you [are] the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered. And they gather and cast [them] into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, so you shall be My disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father has loved Me, so I have loved you; continue in My love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love, even as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have spoken these things to you so that My joy might remain in you and your joy might be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one has greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master does. But I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain; that whatever you shall ask of the Father in My name, He may give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I command you, that you love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before [it hated] you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they have kept My saying, they will also keep yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who hates Me hates My Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them the works which no other did, they would not have had sin. But now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But that the Word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated Me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the Comforter has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He shall testify of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with Me from [the] beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
