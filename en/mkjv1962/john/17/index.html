Glorify Your Son so that Your Son also may glorify You,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>even as You have given Him authority over all flesh so that He should give eternal life to all You have given Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have glorified You upon the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now Father, glorify Me with Yourself with the glory which I had with You before the world was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave to Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they have known that all things, whatever You have given Me, are from You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I have given to them the words which You gave Me, and they have received [them] and have known surely that I came out from You. And they have believed that You sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all Mine are Yours, and Yours [are] Mine; and I am glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now I am in the world no longer, but these are in the world, and I come to You, Holy Father. Keep them in Your name, those whom You have given Me, so that [they] may be one as We [are].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those that You have given Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world that they might have My joy fulfilled in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have given them Your Word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I do not pray for You to take them out of the world, but for You to keep them from the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sanctify them through Your truth. Your Word is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As You have sent Me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I sanctify Myself for their sakes, so that they also might be sanctified in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I do not pray for these alone, but for those also who shall believe on Me through their word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that they all may be one, as You, Father, [are] in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You have sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I have given them the glory which You have given Me, that they may be one, even as We are one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them as You have loved Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Father, I desire that [those] whom You have given Me, that they may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me, for You have loved Me before [the] foundation of [the] world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>O righteous Father, indeed the world has not known You; but I have known You, and these have known that You have sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I made known to them Your name, and will make [it] known, so that the love [with] which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
