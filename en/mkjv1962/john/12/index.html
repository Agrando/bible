And Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said one of His disciples (Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], who was to betray Him)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why was this ointment not sold [for] three hundred denarii and given to [the] poor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and held the moneybag and carried the things put [in].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jesus said, Let her alone. She has kept this for the day of My burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you have the poor with you always; but you do not always have Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then a great crowd of the Jews learned that He was there. And they did not come for Jesus' sake only, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom He had raised from [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus to death also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the next day, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, a great crowd who had come to the Feast</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him. And [they] cried, Hosanna! Blessed [is] the King of Israel who comes in [the] name of [the] Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And finding an ass colt, Jesus sat on it; as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes sitting on the foal of an ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But His disciples did not know these things at the first. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and [that] they had done these things to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the crowd witnessed, those who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because of this the crowd also met Him, because they heard that He had done this miracle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the Pharisees said among themselves, Do you see how you gain nothing? Behold, the world has gone after Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the Feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip came and told Andrew. And again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who loves his life shall lose it. And he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant shall be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour? But for this cause I came to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify Your name! Then there came a voice from the heaven [saying], I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the crowd who stood by and heard said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is [the] judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But He said this, signifying what kind [of] death He was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The crowd answered Him, We have heard out of the law that Christ lives forever. How do you say, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness come upon you. For he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the Light, believe in the Light so that you may become sons of Light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and was hidden from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But [though] He had done so many miracles before them, yet they did not believe on Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>so that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they should not see with [their] eyes nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said these things when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Still, however, even out of the rulers, many did believe on Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Jesus cried out and said, He who believes on Me does not believe on Me but on Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come [as] a Light into the world, so that whoever believes on Me should not remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any one hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him, for I do not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken of Myself, but [the] Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that His command is life everlasting. Therefore whatever I speak, even as the Father said to Me, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
