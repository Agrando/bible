But an hour is coming that everyone who kills you will think that he bears God service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they will do these things to you because they have not known the Father nor Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I have told you these things so that when the hour shall come you may remember that I told you of them. And I did not say these things to you at the beginning because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, Where do You go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I depart, I will send Him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when that One comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Concerning sin, because they do not believe on Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>concerning righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear [them] now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, when He, the Spirit of Truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth. For He shall not speak of Himself, but whatever He hears, He shall speak. And He will announce to you things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will announce [it] to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and will announce [it] to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little [while] and you will not see Me; and again a little [while], and you will see Me, because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then His disciples said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little [while] and you will not see Me, and again a little and you will see Me? And, Because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little [while]? We do not know what He is saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and said to them, Do you seek answers with one another concerning this, because I said, A little [while] and you shall not see Me; and again a little while, and you shall see Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. And you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The woman has grief when she bears, because her hour has come. But when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, because of the joy that a man is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And therefore you now have sorrow. But I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day you shall ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in My name, He will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Before now you have asked nothing in My name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have spoken these things to you in parables, but the time is coming when I shall no more speak to you in parables, but I will show you plainly of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At that day you will ask in My name; and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world. Again I leave the world and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The disciples said to Him, Lo, now You speak plainly and speak no parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that You know all things and do not need that anyone should ask You. By this we believe that You have come forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the hour comes, yea, has now come, that you will be scattered, each man to [his] own things, and you will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have spoken these things to you so that you might have peace in Me. In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
