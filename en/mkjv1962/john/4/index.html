Jesus, therefore, being wearied with [His] journey, sat thus upon the well. [It] was about [the] sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, How do you, being a Jew, ask a drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me to drink, you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman said to Him, Sir, you have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where then do you have that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children and his cattle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for you have had five husbands, and [he] whom you now have is not your husband. In that you spoke truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you shall neither worship the Father in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You worship what you do not know, we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to worship Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God [is] a spirit, and they who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When He has come, He will tell us all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, I AM, the One] speaking to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And upon this His disciples came and marveled that He talked with the woman. However, no one said, What do You seek, or why do You talk with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman then left her waterpot and went into the city and said to the men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come see a man who told me all things that I ever did. Is this One] not the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they went out of the city and came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the meantime His disciples were asking Him, saying, Master, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But He said to them, I have food to eat which you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore the disciples said to one another, No one brought Him [anything] to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of [Him] who sent Me and to finish His work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, It is] yet four months, and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white to harvest already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to life eternal, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And in this is the saying true, One sows and another reaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Other men labored, and you have entered into their labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed upon Him because of the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that I ever did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then as the Samaritans had come to Him, they begged Him that He would stay with them. And He stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed because of His own word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying, for we have heard [Him] ourselves and know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And after two days He departed from there and went into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in [his] own native-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then when He had come into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When He heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and begged Him that He would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told [him], saying, Your son lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then he asked of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said to him, Yesterday [at the] seventh hour the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This [is] the second miracle Jesus did, when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
