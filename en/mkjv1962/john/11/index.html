If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because there is no light in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said these things; and after that He said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps. But I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then His disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps, he will get well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He had spoken of taking rest in sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Thomas (he being called Twin) said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then when Jesus came, He found him already being held in the tomb four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bethany was near Jerusalem, fifteen stadia away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to comfort them concerning their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she met Him. But Mary was sitting in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I know that even now, whatever You will ask of God, God will give You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said to Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life! He who believes in Me, though he die, yet he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And saying these things, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher has come and calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as she heard, she arose quickly and came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, [they] followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, seeing Him, Mary fell down at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then when He saw her weeping, and also the Jews who came with her weeping, Jesus groaned in the spirit and troubled Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And [He] said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the Jews said, Behold how He loved him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And some of them said, Was not this Man who opened the eyes of the blind able also to cause that even this one should not have died?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus, groaning in Himself again, came to the tomb. And it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who died, said to Him, Lord, by this time he stinks. For it is [the] fourth [day].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus answered her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they took away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up [His] eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I know that You hear Me always, but because of the people who stand by I said [it], so that they may believe that You have sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And saying these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, Here! Outside!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with sheets, and his face was bound with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Untie him and let [him] go!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the chief priests and Pharisees gathered a sanhedrin, and said, What can we do? For this man does many miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him alone this way, all will believe on him. And the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest of that year, said to them, You do not know anything at all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he did not speak this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not for that nation only, but also that He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then from that day they took counsel together that they might kill Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Therefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but He went away from there to a country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and continued there with His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the Jews' Passover was near. And many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then they sought Jesus, and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, What does it seem to you, that He will not at all come to the feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And all the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands, that if anyone knew where He was, he should make [it] known so that they might seize Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
