You believe in God, believe also in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In My Father's house are many mansions; if [it were] not [so], I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, so that where I am, you may be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And where I go you know, and the way you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You go, and how can we know the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to him, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one comes to the Father but by Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also. And from now on you know Him and have seen Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to him, Have I been with you such a long time and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. And how do you say, Show us the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do you not believe that I [am] in the Father and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak of Myself, but the Father who dwells in Me, He does the works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe Me that I [am] in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the very works themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes on Me, the works that I do he shall do also, and greater [works] than these he shall do, because I go to My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatever you may ask in My name, that I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you ask anything in My name, I will do [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If you love Me, keep My commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, so that He may be with you forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive because it does not see Him nor know Him. But you know Him, for He dwells with you and shall be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet a little [while] and the world does not see Me any more. But you see Me. Because I live, you shall live also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that day you shall know that I [am] in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me. And he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will reveal Myself to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, Lord, how is it that You will reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loves Me, he will keep My Word. And My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who does not love Me does not keep My words, and the Word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have spoken these things to you, being present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have heard how I said to you, I go away and I am coming to you [again]. If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, I go to the Father, for My Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now I have told you before [it] happens, so that when it happens you might believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I shall no longer speak many things with you, for the ruler of this world comes, and he has nothing in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father has given Me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go away from here.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
