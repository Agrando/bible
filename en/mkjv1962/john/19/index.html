And they put a purple robe on Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they struck Him with their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Pilate went out again and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you so that you may know that I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And [Pilate] said to them, Behold the man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then when the chief priests and under-officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify [Him]! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And [he] went again into the praetorium and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Pilate said to him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, You could have no authority against Me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From this [time], Pilate sought to release Him. But the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then when Pilate heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement (but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was [the] preparation of the Passover, and about [the] sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold your king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried out, Away with [him]! Away with [him]! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he delivered Him up to them that He might be crucified. And they took Jesus and led [Him] away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And bearing His cross, He went out to a place called, [The Place] of a Skull (which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate wrote a title and put [it] on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, the king of the Jews, but that he said, I am king of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then when they had crucified Jesus, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, one part to each soldier; and also [His] tunic. And the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore they said among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to find whose it shall be (that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among them, and  for] my garment they cast lots). Therefore the soldiers did these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And His mother stood by the cross of Jesus, and His mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then when Jesus saw [His] mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, Woman, behold your son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her into [his] own [home].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then a vessel full of vinegar was set. And they filled a sponge with sour wine and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, It is finished! And He bowed [His] head and gave up the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews, because it was Preparation, begged Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath. For that sabbath was a high day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers pierced His side [with] a lance, and instantly there came out blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he who saw bore record, and his record is true. And he knows that he speaks true, so that you might believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things were done so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of Him shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another Scripture says, They shall look upon [Him] whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews) begged of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave permission. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Nicodemus also came, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then they took the body of Jesus and wound it with linens with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews to bury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one yet had been placed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There, then, because of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
