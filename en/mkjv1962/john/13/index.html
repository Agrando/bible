And He took a towel and girded Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>After that He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel with which He was girded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered and said to him, You do not know what I do now, but you shall know hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to Him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no need except to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit. And you are clean, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He knew who would betray Him. Therefore He said, You are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So after He had washed their feet and had taken His garments and had reclined again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call Me the Teacher, and Lord, and you say well, for I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If then I, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his master, neither is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I do not speak of you all; I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From now I tell you before [it] comes, so that when it happens you may believe that I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I send receives Me. And he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had said this, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you shall betray Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the disciples looked upon one another, wondering of whom He spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But there was one of His disciples leaning upon Jesus' bosom, the one whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore signaled to him to ask whom it might be of whom He spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And lying on Jesus' breast, he said to him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the morsel when I have dipped [it]. And dipping the morsel, He gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, the [son] of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the morsel, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But no one reclining knew for what [reason] He spoke this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some thought, because Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need [of] for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He then, having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then when he had left, Jesus said, Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God is glorified in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself, and shall immediately glorify Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, I am with you yet a little while. You shall seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come, so I now say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. As I have loved you, you should also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this all shall know that you are My disciples, if you have love toward one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where do You go? Jesus answered him, Where I go you cannot now follow Me, but you shall follow Me afterward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to Him, Lord, why cannot I follow You now? I will lay down my life for Your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for My sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow until you have denied Me three times.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
