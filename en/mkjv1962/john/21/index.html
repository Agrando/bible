And He revealed [Himself] this way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Simon Peter, and Thomas called [the] Twin, and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Simon Peter said to them, I am going out to fish. They said to him, We will go with you also. They went out and entered into a boat immediately. And that night they caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when the morning had come, Jesus stood on the shore. But the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jesus said to them, Children, do you have anything to eat? They answered Him, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find. Therefore they cast, and now they no longer had [the] strength to draw, from the multitude of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then that disciple whom Jesus loves said to Peter, It is the Lord! Then hearing that it is the Lord, Simon Peter girded on [his] coat (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits), dragging the net of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then when they went up on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish lying on [it], and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesus said to them, Bring from the fish which you have now caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of big fish, a hundred and fifty-three. And [though] there were so many, the net was not torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus said to them, Come, break fast. And none of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave to them, and in the same way the little fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This [is] now the three times Jesus was revealed to His disciples, [He] being risen from [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then when they broke fast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to him the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him a third [time], Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things, You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you wished. But when you grow old, you shall stretch forth your hands and another shall gird you and carry [you] where [you] do not wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He spoke this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following (the one who also leaned on His breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he who betrays You?)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, If I desire that he remain until I come, what [is that] to you? You follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then this saying went abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die, but, If I desire that he remain until I come, what [is that] to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there are also many things, whatever Jesus did, which, if they should be written singly, I suppose the world itself [could] not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
