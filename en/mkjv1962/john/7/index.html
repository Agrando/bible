If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For His brothers did not believe in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You go up to this feast; I am not yet going up to this feast; for My time is not yet fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Jews sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the crowd concerning Him, for some said, He is a good man; others said, No, but he deceives the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, no one spoke openly of Him, because of the fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, not being taught?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone desires to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God, or I speak from Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law? And [yet] not one of you keeps the law! Why do you seek to kill Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The crowd answered and said, You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because of this Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers,) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath day so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry at Me because I have made a man entirely sound on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then some of those from Jerusalem said, Is this not the one they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But lo, he speaks publicly, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers truly know that this is the Christ indeed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However, we know this one, from where he is; but when Christ comes, no one knows from where He is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus cried in the temple as He taught, saying, You both know Me, and you know from where I come. And I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to seize Him, but no one laid [a] hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And many of the crowd believed on Him, and said, When the Christ comes, will He do more miracles than these which this One has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard that the crowd murmured such things concerning Him. And the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while I am with you, and [then] I go to Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shall seek Me and shall not find [Me]. And where I am, you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then the Jews said among themselves, Where is he about to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the Dispersion of the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What saying is this that He said, You shall seek Me and shall not find [Me], and where I am, you cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And in the last day of the great feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who believes on Me, as the Scripture has said, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>(But He spoke this about the Spirit, which they who believed on Him should receive; for [the] Holy Spirit was not yet [given], because Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then when they heard the Word, many of the people said, Truly this is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, Does the Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has the Scripture not said that Christ comes from the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them desired to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, Why have you not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, Never did any man speak as does this Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the Pharisees answered them, Also, have you not been deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Is it not true that] not any of the rulers or of the Pharisees have believed into him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this crowd, not knowing the law, is cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus said to them, (he who came to Jesus [by] night, being one of them),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Does our law judge the Man before it hears Him and knows what He does?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search the scriptures and see that a prophet has not been raised out of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they each went to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
