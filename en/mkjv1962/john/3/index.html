Can he enter the second [time] into his mother's womb and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Spirit breathes where He desires, and you hear His voice, but you do not know from where He comes, and where He goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel and do not know these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what we know and testify what we have seen. And you do not receive our witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no one has ascended up to Heaven except He who came down from Heaven, the Son of man who is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who believes on Him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the condemnation, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, because their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he who practices truth comes to the Light so that his works may be revealed, that they exist, having been worked in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea. And [He] stayed there with them and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And John was also baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John had not yet been cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then a question from John's disciples arose with the Jews about purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, He baptizes, and all come to Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves bear witness to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has the bride is [the] bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Then my joy is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must increase, but I [must] decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is earthly and speaks from the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and what He has seen and heard, that He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who believes on the Son has everlasting life, and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
