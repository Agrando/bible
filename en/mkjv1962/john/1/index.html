And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of [the] Father, full of grace and of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, This was [He] of whom I spoke: He who comes after me has been before me, for He was preceding me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And out of His fullness we all have received, and grace for grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the law came through Moses, [but] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one has seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then they said to him, Who are you so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say of yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they who were sent were from the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him and said, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor that Prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but One stands among you whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He it is who, coming after me, who has been before me; of whom I am not worthy to loosen the thong of His sandal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day John sees Jesus coming to him and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is He of whom I said, After me comes a Man who has been before me, for He preceded me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I did not know Him, but that He be revealed to Israel, therefore I have come baptizing with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and He abode on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water, that One said to me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon Him, He is the One who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I saw and bore record that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again, the next day afterward, John stood with two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And looking upon Jesus as He walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, What do you seek? They said to Him, Rabbi (which is called, being translated, Teacher), where do you live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where He lived, and stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two who heard John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first found [his] own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being translated, the Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus saw him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which translated is, A stone).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The day after, Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee. And He found Philip and said to him, Follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses wrote in the law and the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, Can there be any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater [things] than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see Heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
