He and His disciples entered into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Judas who betrayed Him also knew the place. For Jesus oftentimes went there with His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Judas, having received a band and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon Him, went out and said to them, Whom do you seek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I AM! And Judas who betrayed Him also stood with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then as soon as He had said to them, I AM, they went backward and fell to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then He asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered, I have told you that I AM. Therefore if you seek Me, let these go away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(that the word might be fulfilled which He spoke, [Of] those whom You have given Me, I have lost not one of them).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. And the servant's name [was] Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jesus said to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath. The cup which My Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the band, and the chiliarch, and under-officers of the Jews together seized Jesus and bound Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple went out, the one who was known to the high priest, and spoke to her who kept the door and brought Peter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the girl who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also [one] of this man's disciples? He said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold. And they warmed [themselves]. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the high priest asked Jesus of His disciples and of His teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where the Jews always resort, and I have said nothing in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why do you ask Me? Ask those who heard me what I have said to them. Behold, they know what I said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when He had spoken this way, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Annas had sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Then they said to him, Are you not also [one] of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the servants of the high priest, being kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter then denied again. And immediately a cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the praetorium. And it was early. And they did not go into the praetorium, that they should not be defiled, and that they might eat the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Pilate went out to them and said, What charge do you bring against this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered and said to him, If he were not an evildoer, then we would not have delivered him up to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Pilate said to them, You take him and judge him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He spoke signifying what death He was about to die).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Pilate entered into the praetorium again and called Jesus and said to him, Are you the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered him, Do you say this thing of yourself, or did others say it to you about Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would fight so that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But now My kingdom is not from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate then said to Him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say [it] that I am a king. To this [end] I was born, and for this cause I came into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate said to Him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you have a custom that I should release one to you at the Passover. Then do you desire that I release to you the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas! But Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
