For they know his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what it was which He spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jesus said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the door. If anyone enters in by Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come so that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away. And the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The hireling flees, because he is a hireling and does not care for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the Good Shepherd, and I know those that [are] Mine, and I am known by those who are Mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Even as the Father knows Me, I also know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have other sheep who are not of this fold. I must also lead those, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I might take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down from Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment from My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then a division occurred again among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you hear him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not words of one who has been possessed by a demon. A demon is not able to open [the] eyes of blind ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And [the Feast] of Dedication took place at Jerusalem, and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's Porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Jews encircled Him and said to Him, How long do you make us doubt? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, I told you and you did not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, they bear witness of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you did not believe because you are not of My sheep. As I said to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give to them eternal life, and they shall never ever perish, and not anyone shall pluck them out of My hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father who gave [them] to me is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck [them] out of My Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from My Father; for which of these do you stone Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered Him, saying, We do not stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If He called those gods with whom the Word of God was, and the Scripture cannot be broken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you say [of Him] whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may know and believe that the Father [is] in Me, and I in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then they again sought to seize Him, but He went forth out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And He went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John baptized at the first, and He stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to Him and said, John indeed did no miracle, but all things that John said concerning this One were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed on Him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
