But the Word of God is not chained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For faithful is the Word, for if we died with [Him], we shall also live with [Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If we suffer, we shall also reign with [Him]. If we deny [Him], He also will deny us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If we do not believe [Him], [yet] He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Put [them] in memory of these things, charging them before the Lord not to dispute about words to no profit, to the subverting of the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[Study] earnestly to present yourself approved to God, a workman that does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But shun profane, vain babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And their word will eat like a gangrene; among whom [are] Hymeneus and Philetus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and who overthrow the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal:  The] Lord knew those who are His. And, Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore if anyone purges himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified and useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But flee youthful lusts, and follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they give birth to strifes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the servant of [the] Lord must not strive, but to be gentle to all, apt to teach, patient,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>in meekness instructing those who oppose, if perhaps God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of [the] truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and [that] they awake out of the snare of the Devil, having been taken captive by him, so as to do the will of that one.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
