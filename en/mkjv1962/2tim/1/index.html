Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I thank God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>taking recollection of the unfeigned faith that is in you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice.
