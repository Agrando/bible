But we beseech you, brothers, that you abound more [and more] ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and that you try earnestly to be quiet and to do [your] own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that you may walk becomingly toward those outside, and that you may lack nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are asleep, that you be not grieved, even as others who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will also bring with Him all those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we say this to you by the Word of [the] Lord, that we who are alive [and] remain until the coming of the Lord shall not go before those who are asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord Himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God.
