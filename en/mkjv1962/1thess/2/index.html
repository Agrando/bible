[For] laboring night and day in order not to put a burden on any one of you, we preached the gospel of God to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You and God [are] witnesses how holily and justly and blamelessly we were to you who believe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>even as you know how we exhorted and comforted and testified to each one of you, as a father to his children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to His kingdom and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And for this cause we thank God without ceasing, that when you received [the] Word of hearing, of God, you welcomed [it as] the Word of God, not as a word of men, but [as] it is, truly [the] Word of God, which also effectually works in you who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also have suffered these things by [your] own countrymen, even as they also by the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, also driving us out and they do not please God and [being] contrary to all men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always; but the wrath has come upon them to [the] uttermost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, my brothers, when we were taken away from you for an hour's time (in presence, not in heart), more abundantly we were eager with much desire to see your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore we desired to come to you, truly I, Paul, both once and twice; but Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what [is] our hope or joy, or crown of rejoicing? [Are] you not even [to be] in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are our glory and joy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
