And how do you see it now? When compared to it, [is it] not as nothing in your eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD. And be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong all people of the land, says the LORD, and work; for I [am] with you, says the LORD of hosts</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[with the] Word who cut a covenant with you when you came out of Egypt, and My Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For so says the LORD of hosts: Yet once, it [is] a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will shake all the nations; and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The silver [is] Mine, and the gold [is] Mine, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, says the LORD of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the twenty-fourth of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So says the LORD of hosts: Now ask the priests the law, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If one carries holy flesh in the [skirt] of his garment, and touches his [skirt] to bread, or boiled food, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Haggai said, If [one] unclean of body touches these, is it unclean? And the priests answered and said, It is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Haggai answered and said, So [is] this people, and so [is] this nation before Me, says the LORD. And so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there [is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now, I ask you, set your heart on it; from this day and onward, before the placing of a stone on a stone in the temple of the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>from then onward, [one] came to a heap of twenty [measures], and there were [but] ten; one came to the wine vat to draw off fifty from the winepress, and there were [but] twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I struck you with blight and with mildew, and with hail, in all the labors of your hands; yet you did not [turn] to Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now set your heart from this day and forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month], from the day that the LORD's temple was founded. Set your heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[Is] the seed still in the barn? Yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, have not brought forth. From this day I will bless [you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And a second time the Word of the LORD came to Haggai in the twenty-fourth of the month, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall come down, each one by the sword of his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, says the LORD, and will make you like a signet; for I have chosen you, says the LORD of hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
