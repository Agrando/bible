truly the first [tabernacle] had also ordinances of divine service and an earthly sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For the first tabernacle was prepared, in which [was] both the lampstand, and the table, and the setting out of the loaves, which is called Holies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And after the second veil [was] a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all around with gold, in which [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And over it were the cherubs of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat (about which we cannot now speak piece by piece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when these things were ordained in this way, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But once [in] the year into the second the high priest [goes] alone, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Holy Spirit signifying [by] this [that] the way into the Holiest of all was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him who did the service perfect as regards the conscience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[which stood] only in meats and drinks, and different kinds of washings and fleshly ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Christ had become a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by [His] own blood [He] entered once for all into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>how much more shall the blood of Christ (who through [the] eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God) purge your conscience from dead works to serve [the] living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And for this cause He is the Mediator of the new covenant, so that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first covenant, those who are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where a covenant [is], the death of him covenanting must be offered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For a covenant [is] affirmed over [those] dead, since it never has force when The one covenanting is living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>From which we see that neither was the first [covenant] dedicated without blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For [when] Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, [he] took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore [it was] necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified [with] these, but the heavenly things themselves were purified] with better sacrifices than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Christ has not entered into the [Holy of] Holies made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, even as the high priest enters into the [Holy of] Holies every year with the blood of others</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>(for then He must have suffered often since [the] foundation of the world), but now once in the end of the world He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so Christ was once offered to bear [the] sins of many. And to those who look for Him He shall appear the second [time] without sin to salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
