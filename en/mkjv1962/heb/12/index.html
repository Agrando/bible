Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For truly they chastened [us] for a few days according to their own pleasure, but He for our profit, that [we] might be partakers of His holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now chastening for the present does not seem to be joyous, but grievous. Nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who are exercised by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because of this, straighten up the hands which hang down and the enfeebled knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow peace with all, and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>looking diligently lest any fail of the grace of God, or lest any root of bitterness springing up disturb [you], and by it many are defiled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(lest there [be] any fornicator, or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he did not find any place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you have not come to the mountain that might be touched and that burned with fire, nor to blackness and darkness and tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words (which [voice] they who heard begged that a word should not be spoken to them any more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for they could not endure the thing commanded, And if so much as a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and so fearful was the sight [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have come to Mount Zion and to [the] city of [the] living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the [general] assembly and church of the first-born who are written in Heaven, and to God [the] judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than [that of] Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See [that] you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape, those who refused him that spoke on earth, much more we [shall not escape] if we turn away from Him who speaks from Heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, Yet once more I will not only shake the earth, but also the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this [word], Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, so that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for also, Our God [is] a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
