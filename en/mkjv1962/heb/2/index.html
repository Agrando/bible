You crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to Him, He did not leave anything not subjected to Him. But now we do not see all things having been subjected to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see Jesus, who [was] made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He by [the] grace of God should taste death for every [son].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it became Him, for whom [are] all things and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons into glory, to perfect the Captain of their salvation through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both He who sanctifies and they who are sanctified [are] all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, I will put My trust in Him. And again, Behold Me and the children whom God has given Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since then the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise partook of the same; that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death (that is, the Devil),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For truly He did not take [the nature of] angels, but He took hold of [the] seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore in all things it behoved him to be made like [His] brothers, that He might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of [His] people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in that He Himself has suffered, having been tempted, He is able to rescue those who are being tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
