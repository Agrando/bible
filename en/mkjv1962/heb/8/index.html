Therefore [it is] necessary that this One have something to offer also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if indeed He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who serve the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned of God when he was about to make the tabernacle. For, He says See [that] you make all things according to the pattern shown to you in the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which was built upon better promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if that first [covenant] had been without fault, [then] no place would have been sought for the] second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For finding fault with them, He said to them, Behold, days are coming, says [the] Lord, and I will make an end on the house of Israel and on the house of Judah; a new covenant shall be,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their mind and write them in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they shall not each man teach his neighbor, and each man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know Me, from the least to the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In that He says, A new [covenant], He has made the first one old. Now that which decays and becomes old [is] ready to vanish away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
