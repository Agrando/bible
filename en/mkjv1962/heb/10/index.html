Because the worshipers, when they had been once for all purged, would have had no more conscience of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again of sins every year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore when He comes into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but You have prepared a body for Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin You have had no pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, Lo, I come ( in the] volume of the Book it is written of Me) to do Your will, O God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Above, when He said, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin You did not desire, neither did You have pleasure in them (which are offered according to the Law),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then He said, Lo, I come to do Your will, O God. He takes away the first so that He may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By this will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And indeed every priest stands daily ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down [on the] right of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>from then on expecting until His enemies are made His footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Holy Spirit also is a witness to us; for after He had said before,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>also [He adds, their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter into the [Holy of] Holies by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, His flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and [having] a High Priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and [our] bodies having been washed with pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering (for He is faithful who promised),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is], but exhorting [one another], and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful looking for judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He who despised Moses' law died without mercy on [the word of] two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy of punishment, the [one] who has trampled the Son of God, and who has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know Him who has said, Vengeance [belongs] to Me, I will repay, says [the] Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But call to memory the former days, in which (after you were illuminated) you endured a great fight of afflictions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>indeed being exposed both by reproaches and afflictions, and while you became companions of those who lived so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For you both sympathized with my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in Heaven a better and an enduring substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great [recompense of] reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For you have need of patience, so that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yet a little while, and He who shall come will come and will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now, the Just shall live by faith. But if he draws back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of those] withdrawing to destruction, but of those who believe to [the] preserving of [the] soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
