And by it he, being dead, yet speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>By faith Enoch was translated [so as] not to see death, and he was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But without faith [it is] impossible to please [Him], for he who comes to God must believe that He is and [that] He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, having been warned by God of things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark to [the] saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness [which is] according to faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out into a place which he was afterward going to receive for an inheritance. And [he] went out, not knowing where he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs of the same promise with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged Him who had promised [to be] faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because of this came into being [from] one, and that of one] having died, even as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died by way of faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off. And they were persuaded of [them] and embraced [them] and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they who say such things declare plainly that they seek a fatherland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from which they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now they stretch forth to a better [fatherland], that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. And he who had received the promises offered up his only-begotten [son] ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>of whom it was said that in Isaac your Seed shall be called,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>concluding that God [was] able to raise him up, even from [the] dead, from where he even received him, in a figure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, [when he was] dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith, Joseph dying remembered concerning the Exodus of the sons of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, having been born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw [he was] a beautiful child. And they were not afraid of the king's commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Having become great, Moses by faith refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest He who destroyed the first-born should touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry [land], which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah; also David, and Samuel and the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped [the] mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received their dead raised to life again, and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings; yes, more, of bonds and imprisonments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawed in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, did not receive the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>for God had provided some better thing for us, that they should not be made perfect without us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
