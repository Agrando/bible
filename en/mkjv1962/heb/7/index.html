[He was] first by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, [he] remains a priest continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now consider how great this man [was], to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And truly they [who are] of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priest, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, from their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And without all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And here men who die receive tithes; but there he [receives them], of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if I may say so, Levi, also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore if perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made in the law also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man gave attendance at the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it is still far more evident, since there arises another priest after the likeness of Melchizedek,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who is made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For He testifies, You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly there] is a putting away of the commandment which went before, because of the weakness and unprofitableness of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did], by which we draw near to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And inasmuch as [He was] not made priest] without an oath</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(for those priests were made without an oath, but this one was made with an oath by Him who said to Him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they truly were many priests, because they were not allowed to continue because of death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost those who come unto God by Him, [since He] ever lives to make intercession for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For such a high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who does not need, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice daily, first for his own [sins] and then for the people's sins. For He did this once for all, when He offered up Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Law appoints men high priests who have infirmity, but the word of the swearing of an oath, after the Law, [has consecrated] the Son forever, having been perfected.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
