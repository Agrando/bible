And they built the altar of the God of Israel in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as [it is] written in the law of Moses the man of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they set the altar on its bases, for fear [was] on them because of the people of those countries. And they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings both morning and evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as [it is] written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And afterward they [offered] the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were set apart, and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They gave silver also to the masons and to the carpenters. And they gave meat and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and to the people of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all they who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began. And they chose the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jeshua stood up together [with] his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, to set forward the workmen in the house of God the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their robes with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to David king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, because [He is] good, for His mercy [endures] forever toward Israel.
