From the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. From the sons of David, Hattush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>From the sons of Shechaniah, from the sons of Parosh, Zechariah. And with him were counted by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>From the sons of Pahath-moab, Eli-hoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>From the sons of Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sons also of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And from the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And from the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>From the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And from the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And from the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty eight males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And from the last sons of Adonikam, these: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>From the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I gathered them to the river which runs to Ahava. And we stayed there in tents three days. And I looked over the people and the priests, and did not find there any of the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I sent them with command to Iddo the chief of the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, to his brothers the temple slaves, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And by the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of understanding, from the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah from the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>also of the temple slaves whom David and the rulers had chosen for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty temple slaves. All of them were called by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I called a fast there at the river Ahava, so that we might humble ourselves before our God, in order to seek from Him a right way for us and for our little ones, and for all our goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I was ashamed to ask of the king troops and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God [is] on all those who seek Him for good, but His power and His wrath  are] against all those who forsake Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So we fasted and prayed to our God for good. And He was pleased to hear us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, the offering of the house of our God, which the king and his counselors and his lords, and all Israel who were there, had offered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of a hundred talents, of gold a hundred talents</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and twenty basins of gold of a thousand drams, and two vessels of fine copper as desirable as gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I said to them, You [are] holy to the LORD, and the vessels [are] holy. And the silver and the gold [are] a free-will offering to the LORD God of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Watch and keep [them] until you weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and the chief of the fathers of Israel at Jerusalem [in] the rooms of the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring [them] to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth of the first month, to go [to] Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was on us, and He delivered us from the hand of [the] enemy, and from ambushers by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we came to Jerusalem and stayed there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest. And with him [was] Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them [was] Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They were weighed by number [and] by weight of every one. And all the weight was written at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The sons of those who had been exiled, who had come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve young bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats [for] a sin offering. All this [was] a burnt offering to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they delivered the king's orders to the king's lieutenants and to the governors of [the province] Beyond the River. And they helped the people and the house of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
