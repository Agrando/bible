Yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the women, and such as have been born of them, according to the counsel of the Lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. And let it be done according to the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Arise, for [this] matter [belongs] to you. We also [will be] with you. Be of good courage and act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Ezra arose and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel to swear that they should do according to this word. And they swore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God and went into the room of Johanan the son of Eliashib. And he went there, and he ate no bread nor drank water. For he mourned because of the sin of those who had been exiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the sons of the captivity, to gather themselves to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and that who ever would not come within three days, according to the advice of the rulers and the elders, all he owned would be lost, and he himself separated from the congregation of the exiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves to Jerusalem within three days. It [was] the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month. And all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of [this matter, and for the great rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, You have sinned, and have taken strange women to increase the sin of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now confess to the LORD God of your fathers, and do His pleasure. And separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you have said, so we must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the people [are] many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside. And the work is not of one or two days. For we who have sinned in this thing are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And let our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all those who have taken strange women in our cities, come at a set time, and with them the elders of every city and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter has turned from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah made a stand against this. And Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sons of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, [with] certain heads of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by names, were separated. And they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they made an end with all the men who had taken strange women by the first day of the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And among the sons of the priests, these were found who had taken strange women: From the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers were Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they gave their hands that they would put away their women.
