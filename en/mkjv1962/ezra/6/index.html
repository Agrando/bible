And in it [was] a record written thus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem. Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations of it be strongly laid. The height of it  shall be] sixty cubits, and the breadth of it shall be sixty cubits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>[with] three rows of great stones and a row of new timber.
