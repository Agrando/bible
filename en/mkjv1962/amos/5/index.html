There is none to raise her up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: The city that went out [by] a thousand shall leave a hundred, and that which went out [by] a hundred shall have ten left in the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For so says the LORD to the house of Israel: Seek Me, and you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But do not seek Bethel nor enter into Gilgal, and do not pass to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Bethel shall come to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest He break out like a fire [on] the house of Joseph and devour it, and there be none to put it out in Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness [in] the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>seek Him who created the Pleiades and Orion, and who turned the deep darkness into the morning and He darkened the day [into] night. Seek Him who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth; the LORD  is] His name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who causes destruction to flash out against the strong, and destruction comes against the fortress</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They hate him who rebukes in the gate, and they despise him who speaks uprightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So, because of your trampling on the poor, and you take tribute of grain from him; you have built houses of carved stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted desirable vineyards, but you shall not drink wine from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I know your many transgressions and your many sins. They afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the understanding ones shall keep silent in that time; for it [is] an evil time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate. It may be that the Lord Jehovah of hosts will be gracious [to] the remnant of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the LORD, the God of hosts, the Master, says this: Wailing [shall be] in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the tiller to mourning, and those who are skillful in mourning to wailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there [shall be] wailing in all vineyards; for I will pass through you, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Woe to those desiring the day of the LORD! What [is] this for you? The day of the LORD [is] darkness and not light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>as [if] a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[Shall] not the day of the LORD [be] darkness and not light? Even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not delight in your solemn assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your food offerings, I will not be pleased. Nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take the noise of your songs away from Me; for I will not hear the melody of your stringed instruments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But let judgment roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have you offered sacrifices and offerings to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you have carried the booth of your king and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So I will cause you to go into exile beyond Damascus, says the LORD, the God of hosts [is] His name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
