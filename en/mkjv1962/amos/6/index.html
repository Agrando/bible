And the house of Israel came to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Pass to Calneh, and see; and from there go to Hamath the great. Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. [Are they] better than these kingdoms, or their border greater than your border?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You who put the evil day far away, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who lie on beds of ivory, and those sprawling on their couches, and eat lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who chant with the mouth of the harp; they invent instruments of music for themselves, like David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the best of oils; nor do they grieve for the breaking of Joseph!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So now they shall go into exile with the first of the exiles. And the feast of those who stretch themselves shall cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself, says the LORD, the God of hosts: I despise the glory of Jacob, and hate his palaces; and I will shut up the city and all its fullness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be if ten men remain in one house, then they shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he who burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say to [him] left in the recesses of the house, Are any still with you? And he shall say, No. Then he shall say, Hush! For not one shall mention the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, behold, the LORD commands, and He will strike the great house into pieces, and the little house [into] cracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Shall horses run on the rock? Will one plow [there] with oxen? For you have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>you who rejoice in nothing, who say, Have we not taken horns to ourselves by our own strength?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But behold, I will raise a nation up against you, O house of Israel, says the Lord, the God of hosts. And they shall oppress you from the entrance to Hamath to the torrent of the Arabah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
