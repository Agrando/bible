How can Jacob stand? For he [is] small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The LORD repented for this; it shall not be, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord Jehovah made me see this: And behold, the Lord Jehovah was calling to contend by fire. And it consumed the great deep, and [it was] devouring part of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I said, O Lord Jehovah, I pray You, cease. How can Jacob stand? For he [is] small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The LORD repented for this; this also shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He made me see this: And behold, the Lord was standing by the plumbline-wall, and a plumbline in His hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumbline. Then the Lord said, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of My people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the high places of Isaac shall be wasted, and the holy places of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has plotted against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For so Amos says: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely go into exile out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Amaziah said to Amos, O seer, go, flee for yourself into the land of Judah; and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But do not prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king's temple, and it [is] the king's royal house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah: I [was] no prophet, nor [was] I a prophet's son. But I [was] a herdsman and a gatherer [from] sycamore trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD took me from behind the flock, and the LORD said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now then hear the Word of the LORD. You say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not drop [words] against the house of Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the LORD says this: Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line. And you shall die in a defiled land; and Israel shall surely go into exile out of his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
