Will a young lion cry out of his den unless he has caught?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will a bird fall into a trap [on] the ground, and there is no bait for it? Will a trap spring up from the ground, and nothing at all be caught?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a ram's horn is blown in a city, will the people not also tremble? If there is a calamity in a city, has the LORD not also done it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Lord Jehovah will do nothing unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken; who will not prophesy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Make [it] heard at the palaces of Ashdod, and the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: Gather yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great uproars in its midst, and the oppressed in its midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they do not know to do right, says the LORD, those who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the Lord Jehovah says this: An enemy! And he [shall be] all around the land; and he shall bring you down from your strength, and your palaces shall be plundered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So says the LORD: As the shepherd takes two legs out of the mouth of the lion, or a piece of an ear; so shall the sons of Israel be taken out, those who dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus [on] a couch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hear and testify in the house of Jacob, says the Lord Jehovah, the God of hosts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel on him, I will also visit the altars of Bethel. And the horns of the altar shall be cut off and shall fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will strike the winter house together with the summer house, and the houses of ivory shall perish. And the great houses shall be swept away, says the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
