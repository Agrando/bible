And the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it; because they deported [as] exiles to deliver up a complete [population] to Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour its palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will cut off the people from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn My hand against Ekron. And the rest of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it. Because they delivered up [as] exiles a complete [population] to Edom, and did not remember the brotherly covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, which shall devour its palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Edom, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it.
