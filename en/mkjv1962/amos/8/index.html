And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then the LORD said to me, The end has come to My people Israel: I will never pass by them any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, says the Lord Jehovah. The dead bodies [shall be] many. In every place one shall throw [them] out, saying, Hush!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear this, you who trample the poor, even to make the humble of the land to fail,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>saying, When will the new moon be gone so that we may sell grain? And the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small and the shekel great, and perverting the balances by deceit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals; and sell the chaff of the wheat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The LORD has sworn by the Glory of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Shall not the land tremble for this, and all who dwell in it mourn? And all of it shall rise up like the light. And it shall overflow and sink like the Nile of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be in that day, says the Lord Jehovah, I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the light of day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will turn your feast into mourning, and all your songs into weeping; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head. And I will make it like the mourning of an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, the days come, says the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land; not [a famine] of bread nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the Word of the LORD, and shall not find [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men shall faint for thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They who swear by the sin of Samaria and say, [As] your God lives, O Dan; and, [As] the way of Beer-sheba lives; even they shall fall and never rise up again.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
