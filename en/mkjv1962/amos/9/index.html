And He said, Strike the capital of the door, so that the thresholds shall shake; and break them on the head of all of them. And I will kill the last of them with the sword. Not one of them fleeing will flee, and not a fugitive of them will escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If they dig into hell, there My hand shall take them. And if they go up to the heavens, I will bring them down from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out from there. And if they are hidden from My sight in the bottom of the sea, I will command the serpent there, and he shall bite them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if they go into captivity before their enemies, I will command the sword there, and it shall kill them; and I will set My eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord Jehovah of hosts [is] He who touches the land, and it shall melt, and all who dwell in it shall mourn. And all of it shall rise up like the Nile, and sink down like the Nile of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[It is] He who builds His staircase in the heavens, and He has founded the [heavens] on the earth; He who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth; the LORD [is] His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Are you not like sons of the Ethiopians to Me, O sons of Israel, says the LORD? Have I not brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah [are] on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth; except that I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For lo, I will command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, as one shakes with a sieve, yet not a grain shall fall [to] the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not draw near, or come in front about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In that day I will raise up the booth of David that has fallen, and close up its breaks; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the nations [on] whom My name is called, says the LORD who is doing this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that the plowman and the reaper shall draw near, the treader of grapes, and he who draws along the seed.
