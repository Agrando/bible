And you shall cast down the high place, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Come to Bethel and transgress; to Gilgal and multiply transgressing [at] Gilgal. And bring your sacrifices for the morning, your tithes for three years;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving from that [which is] leavened, and cry out; call out the voluntary offerings! For so you love [to do], O sons of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, and you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I have also withheld the rain from you, when [there were] yet three months to the harvest. And I caused rain to fall on one city and caused it not to rain on another city; one piece was rained on, and the piece on which it did not rain dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So two [or] three cities wandered to one city to drink water, but they were not satisfied; yet you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have stricken you with blasting and mildew. When your gardens and your vineyards, and your fig trees. and your olive trees increased, the creeping locust devoured them; yet you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have sent the plague among you in the way of Egypt; I have slain your young men with the sword, and have taken away your horses. And I have made the stench of your camps to come up into your nostrils; yet you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have overthrown some among you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a firebrand plucked out of the burning; yet you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So I will do this to you, O Israel; because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For lo, He forms the mountains and creates the wind, and declares to man what his thought [is]. He who makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth; the LORD, the God of hosts, [is] His name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
