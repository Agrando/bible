And the angel stood, saying, Rise up and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it was given to the nations. And they will trample the holy city forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will give [power] to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed [in] sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if anyone will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone will hurt them, so it is right for him to be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These have authority to shut up the heaven, that it may not rain in the days of their prophecy. And they have authority over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they complete their testimony, the beast coming up out of the abyss will make war against them and will overcome them and kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And their bodies [will lie] in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And many of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three days and a half, and they will not allow their dead bodies to be put in tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the ones who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, and will make merry, and will send one another gifts, because these two prophets tormented those living on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after three days and a half, a spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. And great fear fell on those seeing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they heard a great voice from Heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up to Heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in that hour a great earthquake occurred, and the tenth [part] of the city fell. And seven thousand names of men were slain in the earthquake. And the rest were frightened and gave glory to the God of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The second woe passed away. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the seventh angel sounded. And there were great voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have become [the kingdoms] of our Lord, and of His Christ. And He will reign forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the twenty-four elders sitting before God on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying, We thank You, O Lord God Almighty, who are, and who was, and who is coming, because You took Your great power and reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the nations were full of wrath, and Your wrath came, and the time of the judging of the dead, and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to the ones fearing Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those destroying the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His covenant, and there occurred lightnings and voices, and thunders and an earthquake, and a great hail.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
