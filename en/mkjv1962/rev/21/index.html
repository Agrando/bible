For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. And the sea no longer is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her Husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there will be no more death, nor mourning, nor crying out, nor will there be any more pain; for the first things passed away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He sitting on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who overcomes will inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the fearful, and the unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, will have their part in the Lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of Heaven from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>having the glory of God. And its light [was] like a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it] had a great and high wall, with twelve gates. And on the gates were twelve angels, and having names inscribed, which are the names] of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From the east three gates, from the north three gates, from the south three gates, and from the west three gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he who talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and its gates and its wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the city lies four-square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand stadia. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he measured its wall, a hundred [and] forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the foundation of its wall was jasper; and the city [was] pure gold, like clear glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the foundations of the wall of the city had been adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls. Respectively, each one of the gates was one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, even the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the city had no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they might shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp [is] the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the nations of those who are saved will walk in the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And its gates may not be shut at all by day, for there shall be no night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there shall in no way enter into it anything that defiles, or any making an abomination or a lie; but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
