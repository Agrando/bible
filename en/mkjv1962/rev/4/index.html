And the first voice which I heard [was] as it were of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you what must occur after these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And immediately I became in spirit. And behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and [One] sat upon the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He who sat there looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. And a rainbow [was] around the throne, looking like an emerald.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And around the throne [I saw] twenty-four thrones. And on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white clothing. And they had crowns of gold on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And out of the throne came lightnings and thunderings and voices. And seven lamps of fire [were] burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And a sea of glass [was] in front of the throne, like crystal. And in [the] midst of the throne, and around the throne, [were] four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the first living creature [was] like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And each one of the four living creatures had six wings about [him], and within being full of eyes. And they had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Almighty, who was and is and [is] to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And whenever the living creatures gave glory and honor and thanks to Him who sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the twenty-four elders fell down before the One sitting on the throne. And they worshiped Him who lives for ever and ever, and threw their crowns before the throne, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Lord, You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power, because You created all things, and for Your will they are and were created.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
