And a rainbow [was] on his head, and his face [was] as the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he had a little book open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and [his] left [foot] on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he cried with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. And when he had cried, seven thunders spoke their sounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the seven thunders spoke their sounds, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Seal up what things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth lifted his hand to the heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there should no longer be time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he will begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as He has declared to His servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I went to the angel and said to him, Give me the little book.
