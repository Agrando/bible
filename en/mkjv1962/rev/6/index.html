And behold a white horse! And he sitting on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And another, a red horse, went out. And power was given to him sitting on it, to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there was given to him a great sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. And I looked, and lo, a black horse. And he sitting on it had a balance in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard a voice in [the] midst of the four living creatures say, A choenix of wheat [for] a denarius, and three choenixes of barley [for] a denarius. And do not hurt the oil and the wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him sitting on it [was] Death, and Hell followed with him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and by the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Until when, Master, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And white robes were given to each one of them. And it was said to them that they should rest yet for a little time, until both their fellow servants and their brothers (those about to be killed as they [were] ) should have their number made complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when He had opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And [the] heaven departed like a scroll when it is rolled together. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from [the] face of Him sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the great day of His wrath has come, and who will be able to stand?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
