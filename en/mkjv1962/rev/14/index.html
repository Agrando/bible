And with Him were a hundred [and] forty-four thousands, having His Father's name written in their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I heard a voice from Heaven, like the voice of many waters and like the voice of a great thunder. And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. And no one could learn that song except the hundred [and] forty-four thousands who were redeemed from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are those who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men, [as a] firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And in their mouth was found no guile, for they were without blemish before the throne of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and kindred and tongue and people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying with a great voice, Fear God and give glory to Him! For the hour of His judgment has come. And worship Him who made the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another angel followed, saying, The great city, Babylon, has fallen, has fallen; because of the wine of the anger of her fornication; she has made all nations to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark in his forehead or in his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he also will drink of the wine of the anger of God, having been mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath. And he will be tormented by fire and brimstone before the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. And they have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the patience of the saints. Here [are] the ones who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they shall rest from their labors, and their works follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I looked, and behold, a white cloud. And on the cloud sat one like the Son of man, having a golden crown on His head, and a sharp sickle in His hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came out of the temple, crying in a great voice to Him sitting on the cloud, Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth was dried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He sitting on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another angel came out of the temple in Heaven, also having a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another angel came out from the altar, who had authority over fire. And he spoke with a great cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast [it] into the great winepress of the anger of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, for the space of a thousand, six hundred stadia.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
