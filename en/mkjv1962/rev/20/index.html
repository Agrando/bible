And after that he must be loosed a little time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And [I saw] the souls of those who had been beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the Word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast nor his image, nor had received [his] mark on their foreheads, nor in their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This [is] the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed and holy [is] he who has part in the first resurrection. The second death has no authority over these, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with Him a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be loosed out of his prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle. The number of them [is] as the sand of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they went up over the breadth of the earth and circled around the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of Heaven and devoured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Devil who deceived them was cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [were]. And he will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw a great white throne, and Him sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And a place was not found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I saw the dead, the small and the great, stand before God. And books were opened, and another book was opened, [which is] the Book of Life. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sea gave up the dead in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead in them. And each one of them was judged according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire. This is the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if anyone was not found having been written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the Lake of Fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
