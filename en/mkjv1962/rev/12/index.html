And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his tail drew the third [part] of the stars of heaven, and cast them onto the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman being about to bear, so that when she bears he might devour her child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she bore a son, a male, who is going to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught up to God and [to] His throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, so that they might nourish her there a thousand, two hundred [and] sixty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was war in Heaven. Michael and his angels warring against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels warred,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but did not prevail. Nor was place found for them in Heaven any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent called Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I heard a great voice saying in Heaven, Now has come the salvation and power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ. For the accuser of our brothers is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony. And they did not love their soul until death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and those tabernacling in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and in the sea! For the Devil came down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a little time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who bore the man [child].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the serpent's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the serpent cast out of his mouth water like a flood after the woman, so that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the earth helped the woman. And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the dragon was enraged over the woman, and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
