And many incenses were given to him, so that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar before the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the smoke of the incense [which came] with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God from the angel's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar, and cast [it] into the earth.
