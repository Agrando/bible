And the earth was lighted up from his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen! And it has become the dwelling-place of demons, and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean bird which has been hated,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>because of the wine of the anger of her fornication which all the nations have drunk. And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. And the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her luxury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I heard another voice from Heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you may not be partakers of her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For her sins joined together, even up to Heaven, and God has remembered her unjust deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Reward her as she has rewarded you, and double to her double, according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix double to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As much as she has glorified herself and has lived in luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her. For she says in her heart, I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow; and I do not see mourning at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore her plagues will come in one day, death and mourning and famine. And she will be consumed with fire, for the Lord God who judges her [is] strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived in luxury with her will weep for her, and will wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, Babylon, that strong city! For in one hour your judgment came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their cargo any more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of very precious wood, and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon, and incenses, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the fruits of the lust of your soul have departed from you, and all the fat things and the bright things departed from you, and you will find them no more, not at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and saying, Woe! Woe to the great city which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in one hour such great riches was desolated. And every ship-pilot, and all the company on the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What [is] like the great city?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they threw dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, by which all who had ships in the sea were rich out of her costliness! For in one hour she was ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, Heaven, and the holy apostles, and the prophets, since God judged your judgment on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw [it] into the sea, saying, So on an impulse the great city, Babylon, will be thrown down and not at all will be found any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the voice of harpers, and of musicians. and flutists, and of trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. And every craftsman of any craft will not be found any more in you. And the sound of a mill will never more be heard at all in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the light of a lamp will never more shine at all in you. And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will never more be heard at all in you. For your merchants were the great ones of the earth; for by your sorceries all nations were deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all those who were slain on the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
