And He signified [it] by sending His angel to His servant John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>who bore record of the Word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that he saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed [is] the [one] who reads and hears the words of this prophecy, and the ones keeping the things written in it, for the time [is] near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who [is] coming; and from the seven spirits which are before His throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>even from Jesus Christ the faithful Witness, the First-born from the dead and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and made us kings and priests to God and His Father, to Him [be] glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him will see Him, and all the kindreds of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am the Alpha and Omega, [the] Beginning and [the] Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who [is] to come, the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I, John, [who] also [am] your brother and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island that is called Patmos, for the Word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I came to be in [the] Spirit in the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>saying, I am the Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last. Also, What you see, write in a book and send [it] to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands. And in the midst of the seven lampstands I saw [One] like [the] Son of man, clothed with a garment down to [the] feet, and tied around the breast with a golden band.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His head and hair [were] white like wool, as white as snow. And His eyes [were] like a flame of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And His feet were like burnished brass having been fired in a furnace. And His voice was like the sound of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He had seven stars in His right hand, and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. And His face [was] like the sun shining in its strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying to me, Do not fear, I am the First and the Last,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the Living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am alive for ever and ever, Amen. And I have the keys of hell and of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
