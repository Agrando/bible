And [you] tried those pretending to be apostles, and are not, and have found them liars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And [you] have borne, and have patience, and for My name's sake you have labored and have not fainted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I have against you that you left your first love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and will remove your lampstand out of its place unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you have this, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: The First and the Last, who became dead and lived, says these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know your works and tribulation and poverty (but you are rich), and [I know] the blasphemy of those saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not at all fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the Devil will cast [some] of you into prison, so that you may be tried. And you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write: He who has the sharp sword with two edges says these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know your works, and where you live, [even] where Satan's seat [is]. And you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in those days in which Antipas [was] My faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So you also have those who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent! But if not I will come to you quickly, and will fight with them by the sword of My mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give to him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows except he who receives [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: The Son of God, He who has His eyes like a flame of fire and His feet like burnished metal, says these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know your works and love and service and faith and your patience, and your works; and the last [to be] more than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have a few things against you because you allow that woman Jezebel to teach, she saying herself [to be] a prophetess, and to cause My servants to go astray, and to commit fornication, and to eat idol-sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave her time that she might repent of her fornication, and she did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I am throwing her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will kill her children with death. And all the churches will know that I am He who searches the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will put on you no other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But that which you have, hold fast until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he who overcomes and keeps My works to the end, to him I will give power over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he will rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels [of a potter] they will be broken to pieces, even as I received from My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will give him the Morning Star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
