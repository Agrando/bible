And I saw a star fall from the heaven to the earth, and it was given the key of the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it opened the bottomless pit. And there arose a smoke out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And out of the smoke came forth locusts onto the earth. And authority was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months. And their torment [was] like a scorpion's torment when he stings a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in those days men will seek death and will not find it. And they will long to die, and death will flee from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the shapes of the locusts [were] like horses prepared for battle. And on their heads were as it [were] crowns like gold, and their faces [were] like the faces of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they had hairs like the hairs of women, and their teeth were like [the teeth] of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron. And the sound of their wings [was] like the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. And their authority [was] to hurt men five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue [is] Abaddon, but in Greek his name [is] Apollyon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The first woe is past. Behold, after these things yet come two woes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sixth angel sounded his trumpet. And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, in order to slay the third [part] of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the number of the armies of the horsemen [was] two myriads of myriads. And I heard their number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And so I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates of fire, even dusky red and brimstone. And the heads of the horses [were] like the heads of lions. And out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By these three the third [part] of men was killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For their authority is in their mouth and in their tails. For their tails [were] like serpents with heads, and with them they do harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues [still] did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and golden, and silver, and bronze, and stone, and wooden idols (which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
