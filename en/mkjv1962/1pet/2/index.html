But to those who are disobedient, [He is the] Stone which the builders rejected; this One came to be [the] Head of the corner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and a Stone-of-stumbling and a Rock-of-offense to those disobeying, who stumble at the word, to which they also were appointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for possession, so that you might speak of the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[you] who then were not a people, but now the people of God, those not pitied [then], but now pitied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Dearly beloved, I exhort [you] as [temporary] residents and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>having your conduct honest among the nations, in that which they speak against you as evildoers, they may glorify God in a day of [His] visitation, seeing [your] good works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then be in obedience to every ordinance of men, because of the Lord, whether to a king as supreme,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governors as sent by Him for vengeance [on] evildoers, but for praise [on] well-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For such is the will of God, doing good to silence the ignorance of foolish men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as free, and not having freedom as a cover of evil, but as servants of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Honor all.

But if you suffer [while] doing good, and patiently endure, this [is] a grace from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For you were not called to this? For Christ also suffered on our behalf, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He who did no sin, nor was guile found in His mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who when He was reviled did not revile in return. When He suffered, He did not threaten, but gave [Himself] up to Him who judges righteously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[He] Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that dying to sins, we might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were as sheep going astray, but now you are turned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
