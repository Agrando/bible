Therefore be of sound mind, and be sensible to prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And above all things have fervent love to yourselves, for love will cover a multitude of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be hospitable to one another, without grudging;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>each one as he received a gift, ministering it to yourselves as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If anyone speaks, [let it be] as [the] words of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God gives, so that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory, and the might forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which is to try you, as [though] a strange thing happened to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but rejoice according as you are partakers of Christ's suffering, so that when His glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you are reviled for [the] name of Christ, [you are] blessed, because the Spirit of God and of glory rests on you. Truly according to them, He is blasphemed, but according to you He is glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or a meddler in the affairs of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if [one suffers] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God because of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the time [has come] for the judgment to begin from the house of God. And if [it] first [begins] from us, what [will be] the end of those disobeying the gospel of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the righteous one is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
