Let him seek peace and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the eyes of [the] Lord [are] on the righteous, and His ears [open] to their prayers. But [the] Lord's face [is] against [those] who do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And who [is] the [one] who will harm you if you become imitators of the good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you also suffer for righteousness' sake, [you are] blessed. And do not fear their fear, nor be troubled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and [be] ready always to [give] an answer to everyone who asks you a reason of the hope in you, with meekness and fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>having a good conscience, that while they speak against you as evildoers they may be shamed, those falsely accusing your good behavior in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For [it is] better, if the will of God wills [it], to suffer [for] well-doing than [for] evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, indeed being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>to disobeying ones, when once the long-suffering of God waited in [the] days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared (in which a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>which figure now also saves us, baptism; not a putting away of [the] filth of [the] flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who is at [the] right [hand] of God, having gone into Heaven, where [the] angels and authorities and powers are being subjected to Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
