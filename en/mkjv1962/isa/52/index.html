Awake! Put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For never again shall come to you uncircumcised and unclean ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Shake yourself from the dust; rise up! Sit, Jerusalem! Free yourself from your neckbands, O captive daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For so says the LORD, You [were] sold for nothing; and you shall not be redeemed with silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For so says the Lord Jehovah, My people went down before [into] Egypt to stay there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now therefore, what have I here, says the LORD, that My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule [make them] howl, says the LORD; and without ceasing My name is blasphemed every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore My people shall know My name; So [it shall be] in that day, for I [am] He who speaks; behold, [it is] I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good tidings, making peace heard; who brings good news, making salvation heard; who says to Zion, Your God reigns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The voice of Your watchmen shall lift up! They lift up the voice together; they sing aloud. For they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Break out, sing together, waste places of Jerusalem; for the LORD has comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The LORD has bared His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Turn! Turn! Go out from there! Touch not the unclean. Go out of her midst; purify yourself, bearers of the vessels of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel gathers you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, My Servant shall rule well; He shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Just as many were astonished at You (so [much was] the disfigurement from man, His appearance and His form from the sons of mankind);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so He sprinkles from many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at Him; for they will see [that] which [was] not told to them; yea, what they had not heard, nor understood.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
