All of them gather themselves; they come to you. Your sons shall come from far, and your daughters shall be nursed at [your] side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then you shall fear and become bright, and your heart shall throb and swell for joy; because the abundance of the sea shall turn to you, the wealth of the nations will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A host of camels shall cover you, the camels of Midian and Ephah. All of them from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall proclaim the praises of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you; the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you. They shall come up on My altar pleasing Me, and I will glorify the house of My glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who [are] these [who] fly like a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Surely the coastlands shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of Jehovah your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He has glorified you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of strangers will build up your walls, and their kings will serve you; for in My wrath I struck you, but in My favor I had mercy on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore your gates will always be open; they will not be shut day nor night, to bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings may be led.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you will perish. Yes, [those] nations will be completely wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will make the place of My feet glorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Also the sons of your afflicters shall come bowing to you; and all your despisers will bow down at the soles of your feet. And they will call you, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead of being forsaken and hated, so that no one passes through, I will make you for everlasting majesty, a joy of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will also suck the milk of nations, and suck the breast of kings; and you will know that I Jehovah [am] your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For bronze I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver; and for wood I will bring bronze, and for stones, iron. I will also make your overseers to be peace, and your rulers to be righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Violence will no more be heard in your land, wasting nor ruin within your borders; but you will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The sun will no more be your light by day; nor the brightness of the moon give light to you; but the LORD will be to you for everlasting light, and your God your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Your sun will no more go down, nor your moon withdraw; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will be ended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Your people also [will] all [be] righteous; they will inherit the land forever, the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, so that I may be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A little one will become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in its time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
