I said, Behold Me, behold Me, to a nation not calling on My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have spread out My hands all the day to a rebellious people who walk in the way not good, after their own thoughts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>a people who without ceasing provoke Me to anger to My face; who sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense on the bricks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>[a people] who remain among the graves, and sleep in the tombs, who eat swine's flesh, and broth from hateful [things in] their vessels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who say, Keep to yourself, do not come near me; for I am holier than you. These [are] a smoke in My nose, a fire that burns all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, [it is] written before Me; I will not be silent, except I will repay; yea, I will repay into their bosom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the LORD, [they] that burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed Me on the hills. And I will measure their former work into their bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So says the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and [one] says, Do not destroy it, for a blessing [is] in it; so I will do to My servants, that I may not destroy them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who inherits My mountains; and My elect will inherit it, and My servants will dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Sharon will be a fold of flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting-place of herds for My people who have sought Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you [are] those who forsake the LORD, who forget My holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who furnish the drink offering to Fate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I will number you to the sword; and you will all bow down to the slaughter; because I called and you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear and did evil before My eyes, and chose [that] in which I did not delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Lord Jehovah says, Behold, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you will be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold,. My servants will sing for joy of heart, but you will cry for sorrow of heart, and will howl because of a breaking of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you will leave your name for a curse to My elect; for the Lord Jehovah will kill you, and call His servants by another name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[He] who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. And the things before will not be remembered, nor come to mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be glad and rejoice forever [in that] which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and I will rejoice in My people; and the voice of weeping will no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying be heard in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There will not be an infant, nor an old man that has not filled his days. For the child will die a hundred years old; but the sinner [who is] a hundred years old will be despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they will build houses and live [in them]; and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They will not build, and another live [in them]; they will not plant, and another eat. For like the days of a tree [are] the days of My people, and My elect will long enjoy the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They will not labor in vain, nor bring forth for terror. For they [are] the seed of the beloved of the LORD, and their offspring with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it will be, before they call I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust [will be] the food of the snake. They will not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, says the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
