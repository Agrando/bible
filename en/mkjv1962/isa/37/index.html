For the sons have come to the birth, and no strength to bring forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It may be Jehovah your God will hear the words of the chief of the cupbearers, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which Jehovah your God has heard. And you shall lift up [your] prayer for the remnant that is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaiah said to them, So you shall say to your master, So says the LORD, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the chief of the cupbearers returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah. For he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come out to war with you. And he heard and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by completely destroying them. And shall you be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed: Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where [is] the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah received the letter from the courier's hand, and read it. And Hezekiah went up [into] the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, who dwells [between] the cherubs, You [are] He, God, You alone to all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Bow down Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to mock the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and have cast their gods into the fire, for they [were] no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; so they have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You [are] the LORD, You alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, So says Jehovah, God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>this [is] the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him: The virgin, the daughter of Zion, has despised you [and] laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken [her] head behind you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whom have you mocked and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised [your] voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By your servants you have mocked Jehovah and have said, by my many chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars of it, [and] its choice fir trees; and I will go to its greatest height, the forest of its Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have dug and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Have you not heard from afar? I made it from days of old, even I have formed it. Now I have caused it to come, and you are to cause fortified cities to crash [into] heaps, ruins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And their inhabitants [were] short of hand; dismayed and ashamed. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, even grain blasted before it has risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because of your raging against Me, and your arrogance has come up into My ears, therefore I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way which you came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this [shall be] a sign to you: You shall eat self-sown grain [this] year; and the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year you shall sow, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for out of Jerusalem shall go out a remnant, and those who escape out of Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So the LORD says this to the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it [with] shield, nor cast a bank against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and shall not come into this city, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Assyria. And they rose early in the morning, and behold! They [were] all dead corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it happened as he was worshiping [in] the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword. And they escaped [into] the land of Ararat; and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
