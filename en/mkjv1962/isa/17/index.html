They shall be as the glory of the sons of Israel, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall be in that day, the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be as reaping of the harvest grain, and his arm reaps the ears. And it shall be as he who gathers ears in the Valley of the Giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two [or] three ripe olives in the top of the uppermost branch, four [or] five in the fruit-tree branches of it, says Jehovah, God of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In that day a man shall look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, nor respect that which his fingers have made, either the Asherahs or the images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In that day his strong cities shall be like a forsaken branch, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the sons of Israel; and it will become a ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the Rock of your strength, therefore you shall plant pleasant plants and shall sow it a fresh shoot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the day of your planting you fence it in; and in the morning you make your seed sprout.
