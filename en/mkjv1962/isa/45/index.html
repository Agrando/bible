And I will loosen the loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will go before you, and make hills level. I will break in pieces the bronze gates, and cut the iron bars in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I [am] Jehovah, who calls [you] by your name, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel My chosen, I have even called you by your name; I have named you, though you have not known me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I [am] Jehovah, and [there is] none else, no God besides Me; I clothed you, though you have not known Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that they may know from the rising of the sun, and to the sunset, that [there is] none besides Me. I [am] the LORD, and there is none else;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>forming the light and creating darkness; making peace and creating evil. I Jehovah do all these [things].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Drop down from above, O heavens, and let the clouds pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, and let salvation bear fruit; and let righteousness spring up together. I Jehovah have created it.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe to him who fights with the One who formed him, a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to its former, What are you making? Or your work, He [has] no hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe to him who says to [his] father, What are you fathering? Or to the woman, What are you laboring over?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So says Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and the One who formed him, Do you ask Me of things to come? Do you give command to Me about My sons, and about the work of My hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have made the earth, and created man on it; I [with] My hands have stretched out the heavens; and all their host have I commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways; he shall build My city, and he shall let My captives go, not for price nor reward, says Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So says the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come to you, and they shall be yours. They shall come after you in chains; and they shall cross in chains and they shall fall down to you. They shall plead to you, [saying], Surely God [is] in you; and none else, no [other] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly You [are] a God who hides Yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they [who are] makers of idols shall go into disgrace together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[But] Israel shall be saved in the LORD [with] an everlasting salvation. You shall not be ashamed nor blush to the forevers of eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For so says Jehovah the Creator of the heavens, He [is] God, forming the earth and making it; He makes it stand, not creating it empty, [but] forming it to be inhabited. I [am] Jehovah, and [there is] no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain. I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Gather yourselves and come; draw near together, escaped ones of the nations; those who set up the wood of their graven image, and those that pray to a god [that] cannot save. They know nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Declare and bring near; yea, let them take counsel together. Who has declared this of old? [Who] has told it from then? Is it not I, the LORD? And [there is] no other God besides Me; a just God and a Savior; there is none besides Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I [am] God, and there [is] no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I have sworn by Myself, the word has gone out of My mouth [in] righteousness, and shall not return, that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He says, Only in the LORD do I have righteousness and strength; even to Him he comes. And they are ashamed, all who are angry with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
