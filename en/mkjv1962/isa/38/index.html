And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, So says the LORD, Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart, and have done the good in Your sight. And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then came the Word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Go and say to Hezekiah: So says Jehovah, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add to your days fifteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. And I will defend this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this [shall be] a sign to you from the LORD that the LORD will do this thing that He has spoken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>behold, I will bring again the shadow of the steps, which has gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten steps backward. So the sun returned ten steps, by which steps it had gone down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave; I have numbered the rest of my years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I said, I shall not see Jah, Jehovah, in the land of the living; I shall look on man no more with the people of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My generation is departed and removed from me like a shepherd's tent; I have cut off my life like a weaver; He will cut me off from the loom; from day even to night You will make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I place [Him] before me until morning, [that], as a lion, so He breaks all my bones; from day even until night You make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like a twittering swallow, so I chatter; I mourn as a dove; my eyes look weakly to the heights. O LORD, I am pressed down; be surety for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What shall I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has acted; I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these [is] the life of my spirit; so You will recover me, and make me to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, I had great bitterness for peace; but You loved my soul from the pit of destruction. You have cast all my sins behind Your back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the grave cannot praise You, death can [not] rejoice in You; they who go down into the pit cannot hope for Your truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The living, the living, he shall praise You, as I [do] this day; the father shall make Your truth known to the sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the LORD [is] for my salvation; and we will sing my songs on the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs and rub [it] on the ulcer; and he will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah said, What [is] the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
