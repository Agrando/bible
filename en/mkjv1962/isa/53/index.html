And to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For He comes up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground; He has no form nor majesty that we should see Him, nor an appearance that we should desire Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>[He is] despised and rejected of men; a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as it were a hiding of faces from Him, He being despised, and we esteemed Him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Surely He has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But He [was] wounded for our transgressions; [He was] bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace [was] on Him; and with His stripes we ourselves are healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, each one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He was oppressed, and He was afflicted; yet He opened not His mouth. He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before its shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare His generation? For He was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of My people He [was] stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He put His grave with the wicked, and with a rich one in His death; although He had done no violence, nor [was any] deceit in His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet it pleased the LORD to crush Him; to grieve Him; [that] He should put forth His soul as a guilt-offering. He shall see [His] seed, He shall prolong [His] days, and the will of the LORD shall prosper in His hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He shall see [the fruit] of the travail of His soul. He shall be fully satisfied. By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify for many; and He shall bear their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I will divide to Him with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong; because He has poured out His soul to death; and He was counted among the transgressors; and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for transgressors.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
