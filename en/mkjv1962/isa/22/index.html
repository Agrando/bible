What ails you now, that you have gone up to the housetops?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Crashings fill the noisy city, the joyous city Your slain ones [are] not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All your rulers fled together; they were bound without the bow; all found in you are bound together; they have fled from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore I said, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly; do not hurry to comfort me because of the ruin of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For [it is] a day of trouble, and of trampling down, and of doubt by Jehovah of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Persia carried the quiver with chariots of men [and] horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it happened, your choicest valleys were full of chariots; and the horsemen surely set in order at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he removed Judah's covering, and you looked in that day to the armor of the house of the forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have seen also the breaks in the city of David, that they are many; and you gathered the waters of the lower pool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you have counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you have broken down the houses to fortify the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool; but you have not looked to its Maker, nor saw Him who formed it long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in that day the LORD of hosts called to weeping and mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then, lo, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine, saying, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was revealed in my ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you until you die, says the Lord Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, go up to this treasurer, to Shebna who [is] over the house. Say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What is to you here? And who is here to you, that you have carved out a tomb for yourself here, [as] one who cuts himself out a tomb on high, who cuts out a home for himself in a rock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, the LORD will hurl you with a hurling, O man, and grasps you with a grasping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whirling, He will whirl you [like] a ball into a large country; there you shall die, and there are the chariots of your glory, the shame of your lord's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will drive you from your position, and he will pull you from your station.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in that day it shall be, even I will call My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I will clothe him with your robe, and will fasten your girdle on him, and I will give your authority into his hand. And he shall be a father to the people of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will fasten him [as] a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the offshoots, all small vessels, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of jars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In that day, says the LORD of hosts, the nail that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed, and be cut down, and fall.
