He has completely destroyed them, He has delivered them to the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Also their dead shall be thrown out, and their stink shall come up out of their dead bodies, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all the host of the heavens shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled like a scroll; and all their host shall droop, as a leaf falls off from the vine, and as the falling from the fig tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For My sword bathed in the heavens. Behold, it shall come down on Edom, and on the people of My curse for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The sword of the LORD is filled with blood; it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the wild oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For [it is] the day of the LORD's vengeance, the year to repay for the fighting against Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust to brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It shall not be put out night or day; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none passes through it forever [and] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the pelican and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also, and the raven, shall dwell in it. And He shall stretch out on it the line of shame, and the stones of emptiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall call its nobles [to] the kingdom, but none [shall be] there, and all her rulers shall be nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses; and it shall be a home of jackals [and] a court for ostriches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the howling beasts; and the shaggy goat shall cry to his fellow. The screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There the snake shall nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow; there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Seek out of the book of the LORD, and read; not one of these shall fail, none shall lack its mate; for My mouth has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has divided it to them by line; they shall possess it forever, from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
