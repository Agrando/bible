But I said, Leanness to me! Leanness to me! Woe to me! Deceivers deceive, even perfidy. Deceivers deceive!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Dread, and the pit, and the snare [are] on you, O dweller of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall be, he who flees from the sound of dread shall fall into the pit. And he who comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare. For the windows from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth quake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The earth is breaking, breaking! The earth is crashing, crashing! The earth is tottering, tottering!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Like a drunkard the earth is staggering, staggering! And it rocks to and fro like a tree-hut! And its sins heavy on it; and it shall fall and not rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be in that day, the LORD shall punish the host of the high place on high, and on the kings of the earth on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they shall be gathered, [as] prisoners are gathered in a dungeon. And they shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days they shall be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the moon shall blush, and the sun shall be ashamed, when Jehovah of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, in Jerusalem, and gloriously before His elders.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
