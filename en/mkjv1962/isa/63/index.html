I who speak in righteousness, great to save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why [is Your] clothing red, and Your garments like one who treads in the winepress?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples [there was] no man with Me; for I will tread them in My anger and trample them in My fury; and their blood will be sprinkled on My garments, and I will stain all My clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the day of vengeance [is] in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I looked, and [there was] none to help; and I wondered that there [was] no one to uphold; therefore My own arm has saved for Me; and My fury upheld Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will tread down the people in My anger, and make them drunk in My fury, and I will pour their juice to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the LORD, the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has benefited for us, and the great good to the house of Israel [by] which He benefited them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His loving-kindnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For He said, Surely they [are] My people, sons that will not lie; so He was their Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In all their affliction He [was] afflicted, and the Angel of His Presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But they rebelled, and troubled His Holy Spirit; therefore He was turned [to be] their enemy, [and] He fought against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then He remembered the days of old, Moses [and] His people, [saying], Where [is] He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of His flock? Where [is] He who put His Holy Spirit within him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He led [them] by the right [hand] of Moses with His glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make Himself an everlasting name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He led them through the deep, like a horse in the wilderness, so that they would not stumble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As a beast goes down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah caused him to rest. So You led Your people, to make Yourself a glorious name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look down from Heaven, and look down from the place of Your holiness and of Your glory; where [is] Your zeal and Your strength, the multitude of Your tender affections and of Your mercies toward me? Are they withheld?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For You [are] our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does acknowledge us. You, O LORD, [are] our Father, our Redeemer; Your name is from everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O LORD, why have You made us wander from Your ways. You harden our heart from Your fear? For Your servants' sake, return the tribes of Your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The people of Your holiness have possessed [it] but a little [while]; our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We are from forever; You never ruled over them; Your name was never called on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
