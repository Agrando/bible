For I am undone; for I [am] a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then one of the seraphs flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, snatched with tongs from the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he laid [it] on my mouth and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here [am] I; send me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said, Go, and tell this people, You hear indeed, but do not understand; and seeing you see, but do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn back, and be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I said, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities are wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land laid waste, a desolation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and [until] the LORD has moved men far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land [is] great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But yet in it [shall be] a tenth, and [it] shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak being felled, [yet has] its stump; the holy seed [is] its stump.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
