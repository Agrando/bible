Before it happened I revealed it to you; lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You heard; see it all; and will you not declare? I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you did not hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, you did not hear; yea, you did not know; yea, from the time that your ear was not opened; for I surely know that you will betray and trespass; from the womb it was called to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For My name's sake I will put off My anger, and for My praise I will hold back for you, that I do not cut you off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my sake, for My sake I will do it; for why should [My name] be defiled? And I will not give My glory to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, My called; I [am] He; I [am] the first, I also [am] the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has stretched out the heavens. I called; they stood up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let all of you gather and hear; who among them has declared these [things]? The LORD has loved him; He will do His pleasure on Babylon, and His arm [shall be] on the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I brought him and he makes his way succeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come near to Me, hear this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning. From its being, I [was] there; and now the Lord Jehovah, and His Spirit, has sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I [am] the LORD your God who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And your seed would have been like the sand, and the offspring of your bowels like its grain; his name would not have been cut off nor destroyed from before Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go out of Babylon; flee from the Chaldeans. Tell it with a voice of singing, let this be heard, let it go out to the end of the earth; say, The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they did not thirst [when] He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He cut open the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[There is] no peace, says the LORD, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
