And they shall be captives of their captors; and they shall rule over their oppressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it shall be in the day that the LORD shall give you rest from your sorrow, and from your fear, and from the hard bondage which was pressed on you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>you shall take up this song against the king of Babylon and say, How the exacter, the gold gatherer has ceased!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who struck peoples in wrath, a blow without turning away, ruling the nations in anger, a persecution without restraint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the earth is at rest [and] is quiet; they break out into singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, the fir trees rejoice at you, the cedars of Lebanon, [saying], Since you have fallen, no woodcutter will come up against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Hell from below is moved for you, to meet [you] at your coming. It stirs up the dead for you, all the he-goats of the earth. It has raised from their thrones all the kings of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All of them shall speak and say to you, Are you also as weak as we? Are you like us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Your pride is brought down to the grave, [and] the noise of your harps. The maggot is spread under you, and the worms cover you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How you are fallen from the heavens, O shining star, son of the morning! [How] you are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have said in your heart, I will go up [to] the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will go up above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet you shall be brought down to hell, to the sides of the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Those who see you shall stare and closely watch you, [saying], Is this the man who made the earth to tremble; who shook kingdoms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[who] made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed its cities; [who] did not open the house for his prisoners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But you are cast out of your grave [like] a hateful branch, [and like] the clothing of those who are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body trampled under foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall not be joined with them in burial, because you ruined your land [and] killed your people; the seed of evildoers shall never be famous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Prepare slaughter for his sons, because of the iniquity of their fathers, so that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world [with] cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I will rise up against them, says Jehovah of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, and son, and grandson, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will also make it a possession of the hedgehog, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the broom of ruin, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The LORD of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so it shall come to pass; and as I have purposed, it shall stand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to break Assyria in My land, and on My mountains, trample him under foot. Then his yoke shall be removed from them, and his burden shall be taken off their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This [is] the purpose that [is] purposed on all the earth; and this [is] the hand that [is] stretched out on all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the LORD of hosts has purposed, and who shall reverse [it]?

For a viper comes forth from the root of a snake, and his fruit [shall be] a fiery flying serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and he shall slay your remnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Howl, O gate! Cry, O city! O Philistia, all of you, [are] melted away; for from the north a smoke comes, and no straggler in his ranks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What shall [one] then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD has founded Zion, and the poor of His people shall trust in it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
