Against whom do you make a wide mouth [and] draw out the tongue? [Are] you not children of transgression, a lying seed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>being inflamed with idols under every green tree, killing the little sons in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Among the smooth [stones] of the stream is your portion; they, [even] they, [are] your lot; even to them you have poured a drink offering, you have offered a food offering. Should I be consoled over these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On a lofty and high mountain you have set your bed; even there you went up to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also behind the door and the post you have set up your image; for you uncovered [yourself] and went up from Me. You spread your bed and cut [a covenant] with them; you loved their bed where you looked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you went to the king with ointment, and increased your perfumes, and sent your messengers far off, and lowered [yourself even] to hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are wearied in the length of your way; you did not say, Despair! You found life in your hand; so you were not weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied and have not remembered Me, nor laid [it] to your heart? Have I not been silent, even from forever, and you did not fear Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall not do you any good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When you cry, let your gathering deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away. Vanity shall take [them]; but he who puts his trust in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He shall say, Raise up! Raise up! Clear the way! Make the stumbling-block rise out of the way of My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For so says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity; whose name [is] Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, even with the contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will not contend forever, nor will I be always angry; for the spirit should fail before Me, and the souls I have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and struck him; I hid Myself, and was angry, and he went on turning away in the way of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will also lead him, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[I] create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace, to him far off, and to him near, says the LORD; and I will heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked [are] like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[There is] no peace, says my God, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
