The priest and the prophet have sinned through drink; they are swallowed up by wine; they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble [in] judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For all tables are full of vomit [and] filthiness; no place [is clean].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whom shall He teach knowledge? And whom shall He make to understand doctrine? [Those] weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For precept [must be] on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom He said, This [is] the rest; cause the weary to rest; and this [is] the refreshing. Yet they were not willing to hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the Word of the LORD was to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken and snared and taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore hear the Word of the LORD, scornful men who rule this people in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we have made a vision with hell; when the overwhelming rod shall pass through, it shall not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>therefore so says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I place in Zion a Stone for a foundation, a tried Stone, a precious Cornerstone, a sure Foundation; he who believes shall not hurry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also I will lay judgment to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And your covenant with death shall be wiped out, and your vision with hell shall not stand; when the overwhelming rod shall pass through, then you shall be beaten down by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From the time that it goes out it shall take you; for morning by morning it shall pass over, by day and by night; and it shall be only a terror to understand the message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the bed is shorter than one can stretch himself on, and the cover is narrower than one can wrap himself in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the LORD shall rise up as [in] Mount Perazim; He shall be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, so that He may do His work, His strange work; and bring to pass His act, His strange act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So then do not be mockers, lest your bands be made strong; for I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts that a full end is decreed on all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give ear and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he open and break the clods of his ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he has made the face of it level, does he not cast out the dill and scatter the cummin, and throw in the choice wheat and the chosen barley and the spelt [in] its border?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For his God instructs him to do right; his God teaches him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the dill is not threshed with a threshing instrument, nor is a cart wheel turned on cummin; but the dill is beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bread grain is crushed, but not always does one thresh it [with] threshing. And he drives the wheel of his cart; and his horses do not beat it small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also comes out from the LORD of hosts, [who] is wonderful in wisdom, making sound wisdom great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
