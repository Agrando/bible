Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? Behold, you were sold for your iniquities, and your mother is put away for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who knows why I have come, and no one [is here]? I called and no one answered. Is My hand shortened at all so that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens [with] blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord Jehovah has given Me the tongue of the learned, to know to help the weary [with] a word. He wakens morning by morning, He wakens the ear to hear as the learned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord Jehovah has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I gave My back to the strikers, and My cheeks to pluckers; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Lord Jehovah will help Me; therefore I have not been ashamed. On account of this I have set My face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>[He is] near who justifies Me; who will contend with Me? Let us stand together; who [is] master of My judgment? Let him come near Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help Me; who [is] he [who] shall condemn Me? Lo, they all shall wear out like a garment; the moth shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who among you fears the LORD, who obeys the voice of His servant, who walks [in] darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD and rest on his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who are surrounded [with] sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks which you have kindled. This you shall have of My hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
