They have forsaken the LORD; they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger; they have gone away backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why should you be stricken any more? You will revolt more and more; the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even to the head [there is] no soundness in it; [only] a wound and a stripe and a fresh blow; they have not been closed, nor bound up, nor soothed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your land [is] wasted, your cities burned with fire. Strangers devour your land right before your eyes, and [it is] wasted, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a garden of cucumbers, like a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Except the LORD of hosts had left us a very small remnant, we would be as Sodom; we would be like Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the Word of the LORD, rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? says the LORD; I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in [the blood of] bulls, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain sacrifice; incense is an abomination to Me; the new moon and sabbath, the going to meeting; I cannot endure evil and the assembly!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; they are a trouble to Me; I am weary to bear [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes; cease to do evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>learn to do good; seek judgment, reprove the oppressor. Judge the orphan, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD; though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be like wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured [with] the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How has the faithful city become a harlot? [It was] full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>your rulers [are] rebellious, and companions of thieves; everyone loves a bribe, and is pursuing rewards; they do not judge the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, the mighty One of Israel, says, Alas! I will ease Myself of My foes, and avenge Myself of My enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will turn back My hand on you, and purge away your dross as with lye, and take away all your alloy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will restore your judges as at first, and your counselors as at the beginning; afterwards you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her returning ones with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the downfall of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together; and those who forsake the LORD [shall be] consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be ashamed for the gardens which you have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For you shall be like an oak whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall be like tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall put [them] out.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
