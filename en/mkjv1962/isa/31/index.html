When the LORD shall stretch out His hand, both he who helps shall fall, and he who is helped shall fall down, and they shall all cease together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For so has the LORD spoken to me: As the lion roars, even the young lion on his prey when a multitude of shepherds are gathered against him, [he] will not be afraid of their voice, nor fret himself because of their noise. So Jehovah of hosts shall come down to fight for Mount Zion, and on its hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As birds flying, so the LORD of hosts will defend Jerusalem; also defending, He will deliver [it]; and passing over He will preserve [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Turn to [Him from] whom the sons of Israel have deeply revolted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made [for] you, a sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Assyria shall fall with the sword, not of [great] man; and the sword, not of [lowly] man, shall devour him. For he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become forced labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear, and his rulers shall be afraid of the banner, says the LORD, whose fire [is] in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
