All of it shall howl for the foundations of Kir-hareseth; surely [they are] stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For Heshbon's fields droop, the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have crushed its choice plants, they have come to Jazer, they wander [in] the desert; her branches are stretched out, they have crossed the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On account of this I will weep with the weeping of Jazer, the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shouting has fallen on your fruit and on your harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And gladness and joy are gathered out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing and no shouting. The treader shall tread out no wine in the presses; I have made their shouting to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore my belly shall sound like a harp for Moab, and my bowels for Kir-hareseth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall be when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, he shall come to his sacred place to pray; but he shall not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This [is] the word that the LORD has spoken to Moab since that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now the LORD has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be abased with all that great host and the remnant few; small, not mighty.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
