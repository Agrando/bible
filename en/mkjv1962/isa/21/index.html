Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media! I have caused all her sighing to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore my loins are filled [with] pain; pangs have taken hold on me like the pangs of a woman who travails; I was bowed down from hearing; I was troubled from seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart wanders, terror overwhelms me; He has turned the twilight of my pleasure into trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink; arise, rulers. Anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For so the LORD has said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he sees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he saw a chariot [with] a pair of horsemen, a chariot of an ass, and a chariot of a camel. And let him listen, very attentively.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he cried, A lion! My lord, without ceasing, I stand on the watchtower by day, and I am stationed at my post all the nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, here comes a chariot of a man, a pair of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon has fallen, has fallen! And all the graven images of her gods He has smashed to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard of Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden against Dumah: [He] calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night; if you will inquire, inquire, and come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden against Arabia: You shall stay in the forest of Arabia, O traveling companies of Dedanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The people of the land of Tema brought water to him who was thirsty; [they went] before him who fled with their bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the press of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For so has the LORD said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the rest of the number of archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, shall be cut down; for Jehovah, God of Israel, has spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
