I have put My Spirit on Him; He shall bring out judgment to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A bruised reed He shall not break, and a smoking wick He shall not quench; He shall bring out judgment to truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He shall not fail nor be discouraged until He has set judgment in the earth; and the coasts shall wait for His law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So says Jehovah God, [He] who created the heavens and stretched them out, spreading out the earth and its offspring; He who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I the LORD have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and give You for a covenant of the people, for a Light of the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, those who sit in darkness out of the prison house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I [am] Jehovah; that [is] My name; and My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare; before they happen, I cause you to hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Sing to the LORD a new song; His praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and its fullness; coasts and their peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the wilderness and its cities lift up [their voice], the villages where Kedar dwells. Let the dwellers of the rock sing, let them shout from the mountain tops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Give glory to the LORD and declare His praise in the coastlands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD goes out as a warrior, He stirs up zeal like a man of wars; He shouts, yea, roars; He overcomes His enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have kept silence from forever; I have been still and refrained Myself. [Now] I will cry like a woman in pangs of labor, I will pant and gasp at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their plants. And I will make the rivers coastlands, and I will dry up the pools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will bring the blind by a way they knew not; I will lead them in paths they have not known; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. I will do these things to them, and not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are turned back, they are greatly ashamed, those who trust in graven images and who say to the images, You [are] our gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hear, deaf ones; and blind ones look to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who [is] blind but My servant? Or deaf, as My messenger whom I sent? Who [is] blind as he who is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You see many things, but do not pay attention. [Your] ears [are] open, but not any hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The LORD is well pleased for His righteousness sake; He will magnify the Law and make [it] honorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But this [is] a people robbed and spoiled; all of them snared in holes, and they are hidden in prison-houses; they have been taken, and none delivers them; a prize, and none says, Give back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who among you will hear this? He will listen and hear for the time to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to robbers? Did not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in His ways, nor did they obey His law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So He has poured on him the fury of His anger, and the strength of battle. And it has set him on fire all around, yet he did not know; and it burned him, yet he did not lay [it] to heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
