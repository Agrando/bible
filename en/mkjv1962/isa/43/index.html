When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; nor shall the flame kindle on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I [am] the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I gave Egypt [for] your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honored, and I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fear not; for I [am] with you. I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Do not keep back; bring My sons from far and My daughters from the ends of the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>everyone who is called by My name; for I have created him for My glory, I have formed him; yea, [I have] made him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let all the nations be brought together, and let the people be gathered; who among them can declare this and make us hear former things? Let them bring out their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, [It is] true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You [are] My witnesses, says the LORD, and My servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe Me, and understand that I [am] He. Before Me no God was formed, nor shall there be after Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I, I [am] Jehovah; and [there is] none to save besides Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have declared, and have saved, and I have shown, when [there was] no strange [god] among you; therefore you [are] My witnesses, says Jehovah, that I [am] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, before the day [was], I [am] He; and no one delivers out of My hand; I will work, and who will reverse it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all of them [as] fugitives, and the Chaldeans, whose shout [is] in the ships.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I [am] the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise; they are put out, they are snuffed out like a wick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall sprout; shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The beasts of the field shall honor Me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This people [that] I formed for Myself; they shall declare My praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have not called on Me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of Me, O Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You have not brought Me the lamb of your burnt offerings; nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You have bought Me no sweet cane with silver, nor have you filled Me [with] the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I, I [am] He who blots out your sins for My own sake, and will not remember your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Cause Me to remember; let us enter into judgment; declare yourself, that you may be justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Your first father has sinned, and your teachers have sinned against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will defile rulers of the sanctuary, and will give Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
