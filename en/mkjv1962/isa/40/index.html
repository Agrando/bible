And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh [is] grass, and all the beauty of it [is] as the flower of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withers, the flower fades, because the Spirit of the LORD blows on it; surely the people [is] grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withers, the flower fades; but the Word of our God shall stand forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go up for yourself on the high mountain, bringer of good tidings to Zion. Lift up your voice with strength, O you who bring good tidings to Jerusalem; lift up, do not be afraid. Say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come with a strong [hand], and His arm shall rule for Him; behold, His reward [is] with Him, and His work before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry [them] in His bosom, [and] shall gently lead those with young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured out the heavens with a span? And who has shut up the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, and what man taught Him counsel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom did He take counsel, and [who] instructed Him and taught Him in the path of judgment, and taught Him knowledge, and made known the way of understanding to Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, the nations [are] like a drop in a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the scales; behold, He takes up the coastlands as a very little thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Lebanon [is] not enough to burn, nor the beasts of it enough [for] a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All nations before Him [are] as nothing; and to Him they are thought to be less than nothing, and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will you compare God? Or what likeness will you compare to Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The workman melts a graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and casts silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He too poor for [that] offering chooses a tree that will not rot; he looks for a skillful workman to prepare a graven image that will not totter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood [from] the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[It is] He who sits on the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who brings the rulers to nothing; He makes the judges of the earth as vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, they shall not be planted; yes, they shall not be sown. Yes, their stump shall not take root in the earth. And He shall also blow on them, and they shall wither, and the tempest shall take them away like stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will you compare Me, or [am] I equaled? says the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high, and behold, who has created these, who brings out their host by number? He calls them all by names by the greatness of His might, for He is strong in power; not one is lacking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hidden from the LORD and my judgment has passed over from my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Have you not known? Have you not heard, that the everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow weak nor weary? [There is] no searching of His understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[He] gives power to the weary; and to him with no vigor; He increases strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even the young shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but those who wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up [with] wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
