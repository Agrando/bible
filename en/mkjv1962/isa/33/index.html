When you stop destroying, you shall be destroyed. When you stop betraying, they shall betray you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for You; be their arm in the mornings; our salvation also in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of Yourself the nations were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And your spoil shall be gathered [as] the stripping locust gathers; as the running to and fro of locusts he shall run on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high. He has filled Zion [with] judgment and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He will be the security of your times, [and] strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD [is] his treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, their mighty ones shall cry outside; the messengers of peace shall weep bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The highways lie waste, the traveler ceases. He has broken the covenant. He has despised the cities. He cared for no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The earth mourns [and] droops. Lebanon is ashamed; Sharon withers like a wilderness; Bashan and Carmel are shaken out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now I will rise, says the LORD; now I will be exalted; now I will lift up Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring out stubble; your breath, [like] fire, shall devour you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the people shall be [like] the burnings of lime; [like] thorns cut up, they shall be burned in the. fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You [who are] far off, hear what I have done; and you near ones, know My might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sinners in Zion are afraid; terror has surprised profane ones. Who among us shall dwell [with] the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands free from holding bribes, who stops his ear from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall dwell on high; his refuge [shall be] the strongholds of rocks; bread [shall be] given him; his waters shall be sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your heart shall dwell on terror. Where [is] the scribe? Where [is] the one weighing? Where [is] the one counting the towers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than you can understand; of a foreign tongue that no one understands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Look on Zion, the city of our holy meetings; your eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet home, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, nor shall any of its cords be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But there the glorious LORD [will be] to us a place of broad rivers [and] streams, in which no galley with oars shall go, nor shall mighty ship pass by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the LORD [is] our judge, the LORD [is] our lawgiver, the LORD [is] our king; He will save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your ropes are loosened, they do not hold the base of the mast; they could not spread the sail. Then the prey of a great spoil shall be divided; the lame take the prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And an inhabitant, the people who live in it shall not say, I am sick; iniquity is taken away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
