To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Surely they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. In all this His hand is not turned away, but His hand [is] stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And the staff in their hand is My fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to take the plunder, and to strip off the spoil, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet he does not plan this, nor does his heart think so. For [it is] in his heart to destroy and cut off not a few nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he says, [Are] not my commanders all like kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[Is] not Calno like Carchemish? [Is] not Hamath like Arpad? [Is] not Samaria like Damascus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, and their graven images [more than] Jerusalem's and Samaria's;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it will be, when the Lord has broken off all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his high looks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he says, By the strength of my hand I have done [it], and by my wisdom; for I am wise. And I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the people like a strong man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people; and as one gathers eggs [that are] left, I have gathered all the earth; and there was none who moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall the axe boast itself against him who chops with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who moves it? As [if] the rod [could] wave those who lift [itself] up! As [if] a staff could raise [what is] not wood!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones; and under his glory [He] shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and His holy One as a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall burn up the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a sick one faints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a boy might write them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it shall be in that day, the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob, shall never again lean on him who struck them; but truly lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though Your people Israel are like the sand of the sea, [yet] a remnant of them shall return; the full end which is decreed shall overflow [with] righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the Lord Jehovah of hosts shall make a full end, as ordained, in the midst of all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah of hosts, O my people who dwell [in] Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, in the way of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But yet a little while, and the fury shall cease, and My anger [shall be] in their ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jehovah of hosts shall stir up a whip on him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and [as] His rod was on the sea, so shall He lift it up in the way of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it shall be, in that day his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash he has stored his baggage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>they have gone over the passage; they have bedded down at Geba; Ramah is afraid, Gibeah of Saul has fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Lift up your voice, daughter of heaps; shriek with your voice; bow Laish, afflicted of Anathoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Madmenah wanders; the people of Gebim take refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet [he] shall remain in Nob today; [he] shall shake his hand [against] the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror; and the lofty ones [shall be] cut down, and the proud shall be humbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
