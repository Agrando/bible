Having begun in [the] Spirit, do you now perfect [yourself] in the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Did you suffer so many things in vain, if indeed [it is] even in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then He supplying the Spirit to you and working powerful works in you, [is it] by works of [the] law, or by hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore know that those of faith, these are the sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations through faith, preached the gospel before to Abraham, [saying], In you shall all nations be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then those of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For as many as are out of works of the Law, these are under a curse; for it is written, Cursed [is] everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But that no one is justified by the Law in the sight of God [is] clear, for, The just shall live by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the Law is not of faith; but, The man who does these things shall live in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us (for it is written, Cursed [is] everyone having been hanged on a tree);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>so that the blessing of Abraham might be to the nations in Jesus Christ, and that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brothers, I speak according to man, a covenant having been ratified, even [among] mankind, no one sets aside or adds to [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to Abraham and to his Seed the promises were spoken. It does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your Seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I say this, A covenant having been ratified by God in Christ, the Law (coming into being four hundred and thirty years after) does not annul the promise, so as to abolish it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance [is] of Law, [it is] no more of promise; but God gave [it] to Abraham by way of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then the Law? It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed should come [to those] to whom it had been promised, being ordained through angels in the Mediator's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the Mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[Is] the Law then against the promises of God? Let it not be [said]! For if a law had been given which could have given life, indeed righteousness would have been out of Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Scripture shut up all under sin, so that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were kept under Law, having been shut up to the faith about to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that the Law has become a trainer of us until Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But faith coming, we are no longer under a trainer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many as were baptized into Christ, you put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is no male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you [are] Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
