For whatever a man sows, that he also will reap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he sowing to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh. But he sowing to the Spirit will reap life everlasting from the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we should not lose heart in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if [we] do not faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So then as we have time, let us work good toward all, especially toward those of the household of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>See in what large letters I write to you with my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As many as desire to look well in [the] flesh, these compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For they themselves, having been circumcised, do not even keep the Law, but they desire you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But may it never be for me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision [has] any strength, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy [be] upon them and upon the Israel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the rest, let no one give troubles to me, for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.
