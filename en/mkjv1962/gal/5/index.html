Who hindered you [that] you do not obey the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>[This] persuasion [is] not from Him who calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little leaven leavens all the lump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have confidence in you in the Lord, that you will think nothing else, but that he troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I, brothers, if I yet proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the offense of the Cross has ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wish that those causing you to doubt will cut themselves off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, brothers, you were called to liberty. Only do not [use] the liberty for [an] opening to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say, then, Walk in [the] Spirit and you shall not fulfill [the] lusts of [the] flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. And these are contrary to one another; lest whatever you may will, these things you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by [the] Spirit, you are not under law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are clearly revealed, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lustfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, fightings, jealousies, angers, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revelings, and things like these; of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is: love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But those belonging to Christ have crucified the flesh with [its] passions and lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live in [the] Spirit, let us also walk in [the] Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not become glory-seeking, provoking one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
