You have not injured me at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you know that through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you before,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and you did not despise my temptation in my flesh, nor did you spurn [it]. But you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then was your blessedness? For I bear you record that, if you were able, plucking out your eyes, [you] would have given [them] to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then did I become your enemy speaking to you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are zealous for you, [but] not well. But they [only] desire to shut you out, that you be zealous to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But [it is] good to be zealous always in [a] good [thing], and not only in my being present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My children, [for] whom I again travail until Christ should be formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>even now I desired to be present with you, and to change my voice; for I am in doubt [as] to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, those desiring to be under Law, do you not hear the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written: Abraham had two sons, the one out of the slave-woman, and one out of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, indeed, he out of the slave-woman has been born according to flesh, and he out of the free woman through the promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>which things are being allegorized; for these are the two covenants, one indeed from Mount Sinai bringing forth to slavery, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in slavery with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem [from] above is free, who is the mother of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, barren one not bearing; break forth and shout, you not travailing; for more are the children of the desolate than she having the husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But brothers, we, like Isaac, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But then even as he born according to flesh persecuted him [born] according to the Spirit, so it is] also now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what does the Scripture say? Cast out the slave-woman and her son; for in no way shall the son of the slave-woman inherit with the son of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then, brothers, we are not children of a slave-woman, but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
