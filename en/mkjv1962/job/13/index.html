And it would be your wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Would you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will you lift up His person, or contend for God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is it good that He should search you out? Or as one man mocks another, do you mock Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He will surely blame you, if you secretly lift up persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Shall not His highness make you afraid, and His dread fall on you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Your remembered sayings [are] like ashes, your bodies like bodies of clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be quiet.
