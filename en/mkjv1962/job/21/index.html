And why should my spirit not be troubled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Turn to me and be amazed, and lay [your] hand on [your] mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if I remember, I am afraid, and trembling takes hold on my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why do the wicked live? They grow old and become mighty [in] power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their houses [are] in peace, without fear; nor [is] the rod of God on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Their bull mates and does not fail; their cow calves, and does not cast her calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They lift up [voice] at the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the flute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They spend their days in good, and in a moment go down [to] the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they say to God, Depart from us; for we do not desire the knowledge of your ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>what [is] the Almighty, that we should serve Him?
