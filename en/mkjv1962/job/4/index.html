But who can hold back with words?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, you have instructed many, and you have made the weak hands strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your words have upheld him who was falling, and you have made strong the feeble knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now it has come upon you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[Is] not your reverence your hope? Is not your hope the uprightness of your ways?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, please, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the righteous cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As I have seen, the ones who plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of His nostrils they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The roar of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the strong lion's cubs are scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And a word was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It stood still, but I could not tell the form of it. An image [was] before my eyes; silence; then I heard a voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall mortal [man] be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, He puts no trust in His servants, and His angels He charges with folly!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How much less [in] those who live in houses of clay, whose foundation [is] in the dust, [who] are crushed before the moth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They are destroyed from morning till evening; they perish forever without anyone caring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is not their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, but not with wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
