My wound cannot be cured; [I am] without rebellion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What man [is] like Job, [who] drinks up scorning like water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he has said, It profits a man nothing when he is accepted with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore listen to me, O man of heart; far be it from God to commit iniquity; and from the Almighty, to do wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He repays man's work, and causes him to find according to [his] ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has given the earth as a deposit with Him? Or who has set the whole world in order?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If He sets His heart on man, [if] He gathers to Himself his spirit and his breath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>all flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If now [you have] understanding, hear this; listen to the sound of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall one who hates right govern? And will you condemn Him who is just and mighty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who says to a king, O worthless one; and to nobles, O evil one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[How much less to Him who] does not lift up the face of rulers, nor regard the rich before the poor? For all of them [are] the work of His hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment they die, and a people are shaken at midnight and pass away; and the mighty shall be taken away without a hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For His eyes [are] on the ways of man, and He sees all his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death to hide there the workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For He does not still impose on man to go before God in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore He knows their works, and He overturns in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He strikes them for evil deeds in the place of the watchers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because thus they turned from following Him, and they did not consider all His ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[so as] to cause the cry of the poor to come to Him, for He hears the cry of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hides [His] face, who can behold Him? And [it may be] against a nation and a man together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>from the reigning of ungodly men, from [being] snares for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For has any said to God, I have taken away; I will not pervert?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Besides what I see, You teach me; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Must He repay because you rejected [it]? For you must choose, and not I; therefore speak what you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men of understanding will say to me, and a wise man who hears me [will say] ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Would that Job may be tried to the end because [his] answers [are] like men of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he adds rebellion to his sins; he claps [his] hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
