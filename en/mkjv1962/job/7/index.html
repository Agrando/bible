[Are] not his days also like the days of a hireling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as a hireling looks for his wages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>so I am made to possess months of vanity, and weary nights are appointed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When I lie down, I say, When shall I rise? But the night is long, and I am full of tossing to and fro until the dawning of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and has run [afresh].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are ended without hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember that my life [is] a breath; my eye shall no more see good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The eye of him who has seen me shall see me no [more]; Your eyes [are] on me, and I [am] gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[As] the cloud falls and vanishes away, so he who goes down to the grave shall come up no [more].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall return no more to his house, nor shall his place know him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I will not hold my mouth; I will speak in the trouble of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Am I like the sea, or a whale, that You set a watch over me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then You scare me with dreams, and terrify me with visions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I despise [them]; I will not live always; let me alone, for my days [are] vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What [is] man, that You should magnify him, and that You should set Your heart on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and visit him every morning, trying him every moment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Until when will You look away from me, nor let me alone until I swallow down my spittle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have sinned.
