And [what is] the inheritance from the Almighty on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>[Is] not disaster to the perverse, and calamity to the workers of iniquity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Does He not see my ways, and count all my steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot has hurried to deceit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>let me be weighed in an even balance so that God may know my uprightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If my step has turned out of the way, or my heart has walked after my eyes, and if any blot has held fast to my hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>[then] let me sow, and let another eat; and let my harvests be rooted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or I have laid wait at my neighbor's door,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[then] let my wife grind to another, and let others bow down on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For that [would be] an evil purpose; yea, it [would be] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it [is] a fire that devours to the Place of Ruin, and it would root out all my gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If I despised the cause of my man servant or of my slave-girl, when they argued with me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>what then shall I do when God rises up? And when He calls me to account, what shall I answer Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Did not He who made me in the womb make him?
