Let not God look upon it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it. Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let the blackness of the day terrify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year, Let it not come into the number of the months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo, let that night be barren; let no joyful voice come in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to stir up Leviathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none. Let it not see the eyelids of the dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb, nor hide sorrow from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why did I not die from the womb, come from the womb and expire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why did the knees go before me; or why the breasts, that I should suck?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For now I should have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept. Then I would have been at rest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>with kings and wise men of the earth, who built ruins for themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>or as a hidden untimely birth I would not have been, like infants who did not see light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There the wicked cease [from] troubling, and there the weary are at rest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>the prisoners are at rest together; they hear not the voice of the slave driver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The small and the great are there, and the slave [is] free from his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Why is light given to one who is in misery, and life to the bitter [in] soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who is waiting for death, but [it] comes not; and dig for it more than [for] treasures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They are rejoicing to exultation. They are glad when they can find the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>To a man whose way is hidden, God has made a hedge about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings are poured out like the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me, and that which I was afraid of has come to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I was not in safety, nor did I have rest, nor was I quiet; yet trouble comes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
