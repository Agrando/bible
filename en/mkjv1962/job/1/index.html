And that man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God and turned aside from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And his possessions were seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his sons went and feasted in the house of each one on his day. And they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when they had gone around the day of feasting, Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings [according to] the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. So Job did always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And a day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD. And Satan also came among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Satan, From where do you come? Then Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to Satan, Have you set your heart against My servant Job, because [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Satan answered the LORD and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have You not made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth Your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse You to Your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has [is] in your power. Only do not lay your hand upon him. And Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a day came when his sons and his daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Sabeans fell [on] and took them away. Yea, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword. And I only have escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he [was] still speaking, there also came [another] and said, The fire of God has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and destroyed them. And I only have escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he [was] still speaking, there also came [another] and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands and swooped down upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and have killed the servants with the edge of the sword. And I only have escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he [was] still speaking, there also came another and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, behold, a great wind came from the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead. And I only have escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground and worshiped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, I came naked out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed [be] the name of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job did not sin, nor charge God foolishly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
