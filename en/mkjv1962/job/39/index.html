Can you observe the calving of deer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Can you number the months [that] they fulfill? Or do you know the time for their bearing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>[when] they bow down [and] bring forth; they send out their pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their young ones are strong, they multiply with grain; they go forth and do not return to them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who has sent out the wild ass free? Or who has loosed the bands of the wild ass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>to whom I have assigned the wilderness [for] its home, and the salt land [for] its dwellings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He scorns the turmoil of the city; he does not hear the driver's shouts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He seeks out mountains [for] his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will the wild ox be willing to serve you, or spend the night by your feed-trough?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Can you tie the wild ox [in] the furrow [with] his rope? Or will he harrow the valleys for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will you trust him because his strength [is] great? Or will you leave your labor to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Will you trust him, that he will return your seed and gather [it to] your grain-floor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The wing of the ostrich beats joyously; though not [like] the stork's pinions [for] flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For she leaves her eggs to the earth, and lets them warm in the dust,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and forgets that a foot may crush them, or that the beast of the field may break them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She treats her young roughly, as if not hers; for her labor [is] vanity without fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because God has caused her to forget wisdom, and He has not given her a share in understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the time she lifts herself up on high, she scorns the horse and its rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you given the horse strength? Have you clothed his neck [with] a mane?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Can you make him leap like a locust? The glory of his snorting [is] terrifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He paws in the valley, and rejoices in [his] strength; he goes on to meet the weapons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He mocks at fear, and is not terrified; and he does not turn back from the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He swallows the ground with quivering and rage; and he does not stand still at the sound of the trumpet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the trumpet [sounds], he says, Aha! And he smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Does the hawk soar by your understanding? Will he spread his wings toward the south?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Does the eagle mount up at your command and make his nest on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He lives and stays [on the] rock, on the crag of the rock and [the] strong place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From there he seeks food, and his eyes see afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And his young brood also sucks up blood; and where the dead [are], there he [is].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
