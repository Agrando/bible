Who has hardened [himself] against Him and been blessed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[He] who removes the mountains, and they know it not, when He overturns them in His anger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[He] who shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars of it tremble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>the one speaking to the sun, and it does not rise; and seals up the stars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>who alone stretches out the heavens, and walks on the waves of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who made the Bear, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who is doing great things past finding out; yea, marvelous things without number?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold!
