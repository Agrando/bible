No one!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For his days [are] fixed, the number of his months [is] with You, and You have set his bounds so that he cannot pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>look away from him, so that he may rest until he shall finish his day, as a hireling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and its tender branch will not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though its root becomes old in the earth, and its stump dies in the dust,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[yet] at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But man dies and is cut off; and man expires, and where [is] he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[As] the waters fail from the sea, and a river falls away and dries up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so man lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens [are] no more, they shall not awake, nor be awakened out of their sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who will grant [that] You would hide me in the grave, that You would keep me secret, until Your wrath is past, that You would set me a fixed time and remember me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man die, shall he revive?
