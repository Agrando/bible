Therefore I have spoken what I did not understand; [things] too wonderful for me; yea, I did not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear, I beseech You, and I will speak; I will ask You, and You will cause me to know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear; but now my eye has seen You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore I despise [myself], and repent in dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it happened after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you and your two friends. For you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job [has].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now take to yourselves seven young bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering. And My servant Job will pray for you. Surely I will lift up his face so as not to do with you [according to your] foolishness, in that you have not spoken of Me what is right, like My servant Job.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, [and] Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the LORD commanded them. The LORD also accepted the face of Job.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends. Also the LORD added to Job all that [had been his], to double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And came to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had known him before. And they ate bread with him in his house, and consoled him and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought on him. Each one also gave him a piece of money, and each one a ring of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD blessed the latter [days] of Job more than the beginning. For he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He also had seven sons and three daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in all the land there [were] not found women as beautiful as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and he saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Job died, [being] old and full of days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
