And they were read before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, the keepers of the door who tried to lay a hand on King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, What honor and dignity has been done to Mordecai for this? And the king's servants who served him said, Nothing has been done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said, Who [is] in the court? And Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the wooden [gallows] which he had prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? And Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>let the royal clothing be brought, which the king wears, and the horse that the king rides on, and the royal crown which is set on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And let this clothing and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes so that they may dress the man whom the king delights to honor, and bring him on horseback through the streets of the city, and proclaim before him, This is what shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said to Haman, Make haste! Take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Do not fail to do any of all the things you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Haman took the clothing and the horse and dressed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, This is what shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hurried to his house mourning, and having [his] head covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every [thing] that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai is of the seed of the Jews, before whom you have begun to fall, you shall not prevail against him but shall surely fall before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And while they [were] still talking with him, the king's eunuchs came. And they hurried to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
