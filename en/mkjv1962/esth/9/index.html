And no man could withstand them, for the fear of them fell on all people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants and the governors and officers of the king helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Mordecai [was] great in the house of the king, and his fame went throughout all the provinces. For this man Mordecai was going on and growing greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would to those who hated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in Shushan the palace the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>they killed the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? And what [is] your petition, that it may be granted you? Or what further request do you have? And it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Esther said, If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the wooden [gallows].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king commanded it to be done. And the order was given at Shushan, and they hanged Haman's ten sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the Jews in Shushan gathered themselves on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men at Shushan. But they did not lay their hands on the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the rest of the Jews in the king's provinces gathered themselves and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their foes. But they did not lay their hands on the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day of the same, they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the Jews at Shushan gathered on the thirteenth of it and on the fourteenth of it. And on the fifteenth of the same, they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore the Jews of the villages, who lived in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness and feasting, and a good day, and [a day of] sending portions to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, near and far,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to establish among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>as the days in which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions to one another, and gifts to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, the lot, to finish them and to destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when [Esther] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plot which he had plotted against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the wooden [gallows].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore, they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore, for all the words of this letter, and which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the Jews ordained, and took on them and on their seed, and on all such as joined themselves to them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their time every year</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and [that] these days [should be] remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city and these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he sent the letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, [with] words of peace and truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>in order to confirm these days of Purim in their [set] times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had ordered them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fastings and of their cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the order of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim. And it was written in the book.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
