But Mordecai did not bow nor worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king's servants in the king's gate said to Mordecai, Why do you transgress the king's command?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened when they spoke daily to him, and when he did not listen to them, they told Haman, to see if Mordecai's matters would stand. For he had told them that he [was] a Jew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow nor worship him, then Haman was full of wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he scorned to lay hands only on Mordecai, for they had revealed to him the people of Mordecai. And Haman sought to destroy all the Jews throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the first month, that [is], the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth [month], the month Adar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people, in all the provinces of your kingdom. And their laws [are] different from all people, neither do they keep the king's laws. And it is not for the king's gain to allow them to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If it pleases the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed. And I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those who have charge of the business, to bring [it] into the king's treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king said to Haman, The silver [is] given to you, the people also, to do with them as seems good to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the king's scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors [who were] over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province, according to the writing of it, and to every people according to their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's ring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the letters were sent by postal riders into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and [to take] what they owned for a prize.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The copy of the writing, for a command to be given in every province, was published to all people, to be ready for that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The posts went out, being hurried by the king's command, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city Shushan was perplexed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
