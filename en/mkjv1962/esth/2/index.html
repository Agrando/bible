And let their ointments be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew whose name [was] Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he brought up Hadassah, that [is], Esther, his uncle's daughter. For she had neither father nor mother, and the young woman [was] fair and beautiful, whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened when the king's command and his order was heard, and when many young women had been gathered to Shushan the palace, into the hand of Hegai, Esther was also brought to the king's house, into the hand of Hegai, keeper of the women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the young woman pleased him, and she received kindness from him. And he quickly gave to her purifiers and her portion. And seven young women [who were] fit to be given her, out of the king's house. And he moved her and her servant women to the best place in the house of the women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Esther had not revealed her people nor her kindred, for Mordecai had commanded her that she should not show [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house in order to know how Esther did and what was to become of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the turn of each young woman had come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after she had been purified twelve months, according to the law of the women (for so the days of their anointing were done, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with the perfumes of the women).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in this way the young woman came to the king. Whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She went in the evening, and on the next day she returned to the second house of the women, into the hand of Shaashgaz, the king's officer who kept the concubines. She did not come in to the king any more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for his daughter, had come to go in to the king, she asked nothing but what was chosen by Hegai the king's officer, the keeper of the women. And Esther had favor in the sight of all who looked on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which [is] the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she rose in grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins. And he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, Esther's feast. And he ordered a release for the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the virgins were gathered the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Esther had not yet revealed her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her. For Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as she did when she was brought up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, were angry and tried to lay a hand on King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told Esther the queen. And Esther told the king in Mordecai's name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when the matter was searched into, it was found out, and the two of them were hanged on a tree. And it was written in the Book of the Matters of the Days before the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
