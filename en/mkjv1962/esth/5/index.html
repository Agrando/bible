And the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, across from the gate of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it happened when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she received favor [in] his sight. And the king held out to Esther the golden scepter in his hand. And Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said to her, What do you [desire], queen Esther? And what [is] your wish? It shall be given to you even to half of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esther answered, If [it is] good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet which I have prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king said, Cause Haman to hurry so that he may do as Esther has said. And the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What [is] your petition that it shall be granted to you? And what [is] your request? It shall be performed even to half of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Esther answered and said, [As to] my petition and my request,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Haman went forth that day joyful and with a glad heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he did not stand up nor move for him, he was full of fury against Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Haman held himself in. And when he came home, he sent and called [for] his friends and Zeresh his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and his many sons, and all to which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Haman said, Yes, Esther the queen let [no man] but me come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared. And also tomorrow I am invited to [her banquet], with the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet all this avails me nothing as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Make a wooden [gallows], fifty cubits high and tomorrow speak to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the wooden [gallows] to be made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
