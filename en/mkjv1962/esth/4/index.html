And many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esther's servant women and her eunuchs came and told her. And the queen was exceedingly grieved, and she sent clothing to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him. But he did not receive [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Esther called for Hatach, [one] of the king's eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend on her, and gave him a command to Mordecai to know what it [was] and why it [was].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Hatach went forth to Mordecai, to the street of the city in front of the king's gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the silver which Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews in order to destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree which [was] given at Shushan in order to destroy them, to show [it] to Esther and to declare it to her, and to command her that she should go in to the king to make supplication to him, and to seek help for her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him command to Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, [there is] one law of his, execution, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter so that he may live. But I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they told Mordecai Esther's words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Mordecai commanded them to answer Esther, Do not think within yourself that you shall escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you are completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance shall arise to the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house shall be destroyed. And who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for a time like this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Esther said to return to Mordecai [this answer] ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and do not eat nor drink three days, night or day. My maidservants and I will also fast in the same way. And so I will go in to the king, which [is] not according to the law. And if I perish, I perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Mordecai passed over and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
