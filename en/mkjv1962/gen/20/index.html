And Abimelech the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, you [are] about to die, for the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, will You also kill a righteous nation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Did he not say to me, She [is] my sister? And she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother. In the sincerity of my heart and innocency of my hands I have done this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the sincerity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me. Therefore I did not allow you to touch her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore, restore his wife to the man. For he [is] a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live. And if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you, and all that are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears. And the men were greatly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have you done to us? In what have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see that you have done this thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God [is] not in this place, and they will kill me for my wife's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And yet truly [she is] my sister. She [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother. And she became my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This [is] your kindness which you show to me, at every place where we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave [them] to Abraham. And he restored him Sarah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Abimelech said, Behold, my land [is] before you. Live where it pleases you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, he [is] to you a covering of the eyes, to all that [are] with you, and with all this, you are justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his slave women, and they gave birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the Lord had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
