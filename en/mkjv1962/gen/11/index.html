And they lived there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said to one another, Come, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said, Come, let us build us a city and a tower, and its top in the heavens. And let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered upon the face of the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of Adam had built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD said, Behold! The people [is] one and they all have one language. And this they begin to do. And now nothing which they have imagined to do will be restrained from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they cannot understand one another's speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the LORD scattered them abroad from that place upon the face of all the earth. And they quit building the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore the name of it is called Babel; because the LORD confused the language of all the earth there. And from there the LORD scattered them abroad on the face of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These are the generations of Shem.
