And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They had gone out of the city, not having gone far. And Joseph said to his steward, Rise up, follow after the men and overtake them, and say to them, Why have you rewarded evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is this not [that] in which my lord drinks, and by which indeed he divines? You have done evil in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said to him, Why does your lord say these words? Far be it that your servants should do according to this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the silver which we found in our sack's mouth, we brought it in to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[With] whomever of your servants it may be found, both let him die, and we all will be my lord's bondmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according to your word. He with whom it is found shall be my servant, and you shall be blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and each one opened his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched first at the oldest and with the youngest last. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they tore their clothes, and each one loaded his ass and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, for he [was] still there. And they fell before him to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that one like me can certainly divine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we and he also with whom the cup is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Be it far from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant. And as for you, you go in peace to your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Judah came near him and said, O my lord, pray let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not let your anger burn against your servant, for you [are] even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, Do you have a father or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. And his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, and let me see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said to my lord, The boy cannot leave his father, for [if] he should leave [his father], he would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you said to your servants, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it happened when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go again. Buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, we will go down, for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother [is] with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two [sons].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces. And I never saw him since.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And [if] you take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now when I come to your servant my father, and the boy [is] not with us, since his life is bound up in his life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>it shall be, when he sees that the boy [is] not [with us], he will die. And your servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And now please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a slave to my lord. And let the boy go up with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I go up to my father, and the boy [is] not with me lest perhaps I see the evil that will find my father?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
