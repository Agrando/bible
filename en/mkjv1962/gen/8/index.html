And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Also the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and rain from heaven was restrained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the waters returned from off the earth continually. And after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters had gone down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth [month]. And the tops of the mountains were seen in the tenth [month] on the first [day] of the month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it happened, at the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he sent forth a raven, and it went out, going out and returning until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He also sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had gone down from off the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot. And she returned to him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth. Then he put out his hand and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he waited yet another seven days. And again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the dove came in to him in the evening. And, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters had gone down from off the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he waited yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove. And she did not return again to him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened in the six hundred and first year, at the beginning, on the first of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked. And, behold, the face of the earth was dried!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God spoke to Noah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Bring out with you every living thing that is with you, of all flesh, of fowl, of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, so that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every animal, every fowl, and every creeping thing, all which creeps upon the earth after their families, went forth out of the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Noah built an altar to the LORD. And he took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD smelled a sweet odor. And the LORD said in His heart, I will never again curse the ground for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. And I will not again smite every living thing as I have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
