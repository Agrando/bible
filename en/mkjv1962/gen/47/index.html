And he took some of his brothers, five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What [is] your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants [are] shepherds, both we and our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said to Pharaoh, For we have come to live in the land. For your servants have no pasture left for their flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and brothers to live in the best of the land; in the land of Goshen let them live. And if you know men of ability among them, then make them overseers of livestock, over what is mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage [are] a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and I have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph nourished his father and his brothers, and all his father's household, [with] bread, for the mouth of the little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no bread [was] in all the land, for the famine [was] very severe, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted because of the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph gathered up all the silver found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought. And Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when silver failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For the silver has failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle, if silver has failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they brought their cattle to Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses. And he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When that year was ended, they came to him the second year and said, We will not hide [it] from my lord, that our silver has failed, also our herds of cattle, [going] to my lord. Nothing is left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants for Pharaoh. And give [us] seed, that we may live and not die, that the land be not desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them and the land became Pharaoh's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for the people, he caused them to go into the cities, from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Only he did not buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day, and your land, for Pharaoh. Lo, [here is] seed for you, and you shall sow the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall be, as you gather you shall give the fifth [part] to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those of your household, and for food for your little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said, You have saved our lives. Let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joseph made it a law of the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth [part], excepting only the land of the priests, which did not become Pharaoh's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they had possession in it, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty-seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the days of Israel to die drew near. And he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But I will lie with my fathers. You shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do according to your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed on the head of the bed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
