And Abram called on the name of the LORD there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the land was not able to bear them, that they might live together. For their substance was great, so that they could not live together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived then in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we [are] men, brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[Is] not the whole land before you? I pray you, separate yourself from me. If [you go] to the left, then I will go to the right. Or if [you go] to the right, then I will go to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the circuit of Jordan, that it [was] all well watered (before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,) like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Lot chose all the circuit of Jordan for himself. And Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves from one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the circuit and pitched [his] tent toward Sodom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after Lot was separated from him, the LORD said to Abram, Lift up your eyes now and look from the place where you are northward and southward, and eastward and westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For all the land which you see I will give to you, and to your seed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be counted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Rise up and walk through the land, in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for I will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Abram moved [his] tent and came and lived in the oaks of Mamre, which [is] in Hebron. And he built an altar to the LORD there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
