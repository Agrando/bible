And he said to the woman, [Is it] so that God has said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for God knows that in the day you eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it was pleasing to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make wise, she took of its fruit, and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the eyes of both of them were opened. And they knew that they [were] naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made girdles for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God in the middle of the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, Where [are] you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [am] naked, and I hid myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He said, Who told you that you [were] naked? Have you eaten of the tree which I commanded you that you should not eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said, The woman whom You gave [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD God said to the woman, What [is] this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you have done this you [are] cursed more than all cattle, and more than every animal of the field. You shall go upon your belly, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He will bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the woman He said, I will greatly increase your sorrow and your conception. In pain you shall bear sons, and your desire shall be toward your husband, and he shall rule over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And to Adam He said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat [of] it! The ground [is] cursed for your sake. In pain shall you eat of it all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It shall also bring forth thorns and thistles to you, and you shall eat the herb of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you [are], and to dust you shall return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And for Adam and his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he had been taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He drove out the man. And He placed cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
