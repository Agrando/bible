And the LORD did to Sarah as He had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him (whom Sarah bore to him) Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Sarah said, God has made me laugh, so that all who hear will laugh with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she said, Who could have said to Abraham, will Sarah suckle children? For I have borne a son to him in his old age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian (whom she had borne to Abraham) mocking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she said to Abraham, Cast out this slave woman and her son. For the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son, with Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the thing was very evil in Abraham's sight, because of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the boy and because of your slave woman. In all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice. For in Isaac your Seed shall be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And also, I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman, because he [is] your seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave [it] to Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder. And he gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the water was gone in the bottle, and she cast the boy under one of the shrubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she went and sat down across from him, a good way off, about a bowshot. For she said, Let me not see the death of the boy. And she sat across from him, and lifted up her voice, and cried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar out of the heavens, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Rise up, lift up the boy and hold him up with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the bottle with water, and gave drink to the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God was with the boy, and he grew, and lived in the wilderness, and became an archer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it happened at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. Do to me according to the kindness that I have sworn to you, and to the land in which you have lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Abraham said, I will swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing, neither did you tell me, neither have I even heard of it, except today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and both of them made a covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, For you shall take [these] seven ewe lambs from my hand, so that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>This is why he called that place Beer-sheba, because they swore, both of them, there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, rose up. And they returned to the land of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Abraham planted a tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Abraham lived in the Philistines' land many days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
