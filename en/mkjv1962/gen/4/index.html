And she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And she bore again, his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in the end of days, it happened, Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but He did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain glowed with anger, and his face fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD said to Cain, Why have you angrily glowed? And why did your face fall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you do well, shall you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at the door; and its desire [is] for you, and you shall rule over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Cain talked with his brother Abel. And it happened when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] your brother Abel? And he said, I do not know. [Am] I my brother's keeper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to Me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now you [are] cursed more than the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you till the ground, it will not again give its strength to you. And you shall be a vagabond and a fugitive in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold! You have driven me out from the face of the earth today, and I shall be hidden from Your face. And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth, and it shall be [that] anyone who finds me shall kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain shall be avenged seven times. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain so that anyone who found him should not kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and lived in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Irad was born to Enoch. And Irad fathered Mehujael. And Mehujael fathered Methusael. And Methusael fathered Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took two wives to himself. The name of the first one [was] Adah, and the name of the other [was] Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and with cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his brother's name [was] Jubal; he was the father of all those playing the harp and the organ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Zillah also bore Tubalcain, [the] hammerer of every engraving tool of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have killed a man because of my wound, and a young man because of my hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Cain is avenged seven times, and Lamech seventy-seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam knew his wife again. And she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For she said, God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there was also a son born to Seth, and he called his name Enos. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
