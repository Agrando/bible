And he was a youth with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought to his father an evil report of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a tunic [reaching to] the soles [of his] feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joseph dreamed a dream and told [it] to his brothers. And they hated him still more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, I pray you, Hear this dream which I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For behold! We [were] binding sheaves in the middle of the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and also stood upright. And behold, your sheaves stood around and bowed down to my sheaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have the rule over us? And they hated him still more for his dreams and for his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he dreamed still another dream, and told it to his brothers. And he said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream. And behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowed down to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he told [it] to his father and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him and said to him, What [is] this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I, and your mother, and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the earth before you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his brothers were jealous of him. But his father observed the saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his brothers went to feed his father's flock in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Israel said to Joseph, Do not your brothers feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I [am].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to him, please go see whether it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks. And bring me word again. And he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, What are you looking for?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I [am] seeking for my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said, They are gone from here, for I heard [them] say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said to one another, Behold, this dreamer comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore come now, and let us kill him, and throw him into some pit, and we will say some evil beast has devoured him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Reuben heard, and [he] delivered him out of their hands and said, Let us not kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him (in order to rescue him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it happened when Joseph had come to his brothers, they stripped Joseph out of his tunic, the tunic reaching to the soles [of his] feet that was on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they took him and threw him into a pit. And the pit [was] empty, with no water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they sat down to eat bread. And they lifted up their eyes, and looked. And behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah said to his brothers, What profit [is it] if we should kill our brother and hide his blood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him. For he [is] our brother, and our flesh. And his brothers listened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And men, Midianites traders, came by. And they drew up Joseph and took him out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty [pieces] of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Reuben returned to the pit. And behold! Joseph [was] not in the pit! And he tore his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he returned to his brothers and said, The child, he is not. And I, where shall I go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they took Joseph's tunic, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they sent the tunic [reaching to] the soles of the feet, and they brought it to their father. And they said, We have found this. Do you know whether it [is] your son's coat or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he knew it, and said, [It is] my son's tunic. An evil beast has eaten him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all his sons, and all his daughters, rose up to comfort him. But he refused to be comforted. And he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief of the executioners.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
