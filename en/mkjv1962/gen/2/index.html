And He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had rested from all His work which God created to make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they [were] created in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and every shrub of the field was not yet on the earth, and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up. For the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] no man to till the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But there went up from the earth a mist and watered all the face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD God formed man [of the] dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there He put the man whom He had formed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food. The tree of life also was in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden. And from there it was divided and became four heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The name of the first [is] Pishon; that [is it] which surrounds all the land of Havilah, where [there is] gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the gold of that land [is] good. There [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the name of the second river [is] Gihon; it [is] the one that surrounds the whole land of Cush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the name of the third river [is] Tigris; it [is] that which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, You may freely eat of every tree in the garden,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but you shall not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. For in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every fowl of the air, and brought [them] to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called [each] living creature, that [was] its name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field. But there was not found a suitable helper for Adam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept. And He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh underneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD God made the rib (which He had taken from the man) into a woman. And He brought her to the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. [She] shall be called Woman because [she] was taken out of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife and they shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they were both naked, the man and his wife; and they were not ashamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
