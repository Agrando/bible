And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the LORD appeared to him and said, Do not go down into Egypt. Live in the land which I shall tell you of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Stay in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. For to you and to your seed I will give all these lands; and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will make your seed to multiply as the stars of the heavens, and will give to your seed all these lands. And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaac lived in Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife; lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she was beautiful of form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he had been there a long time, it happened that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through the window, and saw; and behold! Isaac [was] caressing Rebekah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abimelech called Isaac and said, Behold! She surely [is] your wife. And why did you say, She [is] my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die on account of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said, What [is] this you have done to us? One of the people might have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the man became great. And he went forward and grew until he grew very great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he had possession of flocks and possession of herds, and many servants. And the Philistines envied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are mightier than we are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Isaac departed from there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Contention, because they strove with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they dug another well, and [they] strove for that also. And he called the name of it Opposition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he moved from there, and dug another well, and they did not strive for that. And he called the name of it Broad Places. And he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went from there to Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I [am] the God of Abraham your father. Do not fear, for I [am] with you, and will bless you and multiply your seed for My servant Abraham's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there. And Isaac's servants dug a well there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phicol the commander of his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaac said to them, Why do you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you. And we said, Let there be now an oath between us, between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you will do us no harm since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing but good to you, and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and swore to one another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the same day it happened, Isaac's servants came and told him about the well which they had dug. And they said to him, We have found water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he called it Shebah. Therefore the name of the city [is] The Well of Sheba to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>who were a grief of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
