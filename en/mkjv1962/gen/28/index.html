And he said to him, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father. And take a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And may God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, so that you may be a multitude of peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And may He give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, so that you may inherit the land in which you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Padan-aram in order to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and had gone to Padan-aram;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and when Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to the wives [which] he [had] for his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he came on a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took of the stones of that place, and placed [them] at his head. And he lay down in that place to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he dreamed. And behold! A ladder was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to Heaven! And behold! The angels of God [were] ascending and descending on it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And behold! The LORD stood above it, and said, I [am] Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac! The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And your seed shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in you and in your Seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, behold, I [am] with you, and will keep you in every [place] where you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jacob awakened from his sleep. And he said, Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he was afraid, and said, How fearful [is] this place! This [is] nothing but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of Heaven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone which he had put at his head, and set it [as] a memorial pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he called the name of that place The House of God. But the name of that city [was] Luz at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I come again to my father's house in peace, then shall Jehovah be my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house. And of all that You shall give me, I will surely give the tenth to You.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
