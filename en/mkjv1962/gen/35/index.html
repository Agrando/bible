And make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods among you, and be clean, and change your garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And let us arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they gave all the strange gods which [were] in their hands to Jacob, and the earrings in their ears. And Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they moved. And the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he built an altar there and called the place El-bethel, because God appeared to him there when he fled from the face of his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Bethel, under an oak. And the name of it was called Oak of Weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram and blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And God said to him, Your name [is] Jacob. Your name shall not be called Jacob any more, but Israel shall be your name. And He called his name Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God said to him, I [am] God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall be from you, and kings shall come out of your loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, and to your seed after you I will give the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And God went up from him in the place where He talked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar of stone. And he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they moved from Bethel. And there was only a length of land to come to Ephrath. And Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor in her bearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened when she was in hard labor in her bearing, the midwife said to her, Do not fear, you shall have this son also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it happened as her soul was departing (for she died) that she called his name Benoni. But his father called him Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Rachel died and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave. That is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel moved, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it happened when Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard it. And the sons of Jacob were twelve:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's slave woman: Dan and Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's slave woman: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob born to him in Padan-aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jacob came to his father Isaac, to Mamre, to the city of Arba, which [is] Hebron, where Abraham had lived, and Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, old and satisfied of days. And his sons, Esau and Jacob, buried him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
