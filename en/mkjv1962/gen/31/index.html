But God did not allow him to hurt me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If he said this, The speckled shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said this, The striped shall be your hire, then all the flocks bore striped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God has taken away the flocks of your father, and has given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And at the time the cattle conceived, I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were striped, speckled, and mottled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob! And I said, Here I [am].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He said, Lift up your eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle, that they [are] striped, speckled, and mottled. For I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I [am] the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, where you vowed a vow to Me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, [Is there] yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Are we not counted strangers by him? For he has sold us, and has also entirely devoured our silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all the riches which God has taken from our father, that [is] for us and for our sons. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and wives upon camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he drove away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his property, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, in order to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban went to shear his sheep. And Rachel had stolen the images which were her father's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob deceived the heart of Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he fled with all that was his. And he rose up and passed over the river, and set his face toward Mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. And they overtook him in Mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that you do not speak either good or bad to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Laban overtook Jacob. And Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount. And Laban with his brothers pitched in Mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have deceived my heart and carried away my daughters as captives [taken] with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret and with harp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why have you not allowed me to kiss my sons and my daughters? You have done foolishly in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in the power of my hand to do you harm. But the God of your fathers spoke to me last night, saying, Take heed that you do not speak either good or bad to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now you have gone because you longed after your father's house. Why have you stolen my gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I [was] afraid, for I said, Perhaps you would take your daughters away from me by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With whomever you find your gods, let him not live. Before our brothers, choose what [is] yours with me, and take [it] to you. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tents of the two slave women, and he did not find. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Rachel had taken the images and put them into the camel's saddle, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but did not find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you. For the custom of women [is] upon me. And he searched, but did not find the images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob was angry, and rebuked Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What [is] my trespass? What [is] my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you have searched all my stuff; what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I [was] with you these twenty years. Your ewes and she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock I have not eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>That which was mangled I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You required it at my hand, [whether] stolen by day, or stolen by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I was there; in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night. And my sleep departed from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And I have been twenty years in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six for your flocks. And you have changed my wages ten times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Unless the God of my fathers, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac had been with me, surely you would have sent me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked [you last] night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters [are] my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the flocks my flocks. All that you see [is] mine. And what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their sons which they have borne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be for a witness between you and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones. And they took stones and made a heap. And they ate there upon the heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Laban called it in [Syrian], Heap of the Testimony, and Jacob called it in Hebrew, Heap of Testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Laban said, This heap [is] a witness between you and me this day. Therefore the name of it was called Heap of Testimony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and Watchtower, for he said, The LORD watch between you and me when we are absent from one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If you shall not] afflict my daughters, or if you shall take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us. See! God is witness between you and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set up between you and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This heap [is] a witness, and the pillar [is] a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Jacob offered sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night in the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
