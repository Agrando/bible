And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I am a stranger and a visitor with you. Give me a possession of a burying place with you, so that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of Heth answered Abraham saying to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hear us, my lord. You [are] a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choice of our burying places. None of us shall withhold from you his burying-place from burying your dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he spoke with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and ask for me of Ephron the son of Zohar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he has, which [is] in the end of his field.

And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and the cave that [is] in it I give to you. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you.
