And, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it, for they watered the flocks out of that well. And a great stone [was] upon the well's mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the flocks were gathered there. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jacob said to them, My brothers, where [are] you from? And they said, We [are] from Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, [Is] he well? And they said, He [is] well. And, behold, his daughter Rachel comes with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, Lo, the day [is] yet high. [It is] not yet time for gathering the cattle together. Water the sheep, and go feed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks have been gathered together. And they roll the stone from the well's mouth, then we water the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>While he still spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, then Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flocks of Laban his mother's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he [was] her father's brother, and that he [was] Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him, Surely you [are] my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him for a month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Because you [are] my brother, should you then serve me for nothing? Tell me, what [shall be] your wages?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Leah was weak of eyes, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said, [It is] better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him a few days, for the love he had for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jacob said to Laban, Give [me] my wife, for my days are fulfilled, so that I may go in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it happened in the evening, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him. And he went in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave Zilpah his slave woman to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it happened in the morning, behold, it [was] Leah! And he said to Laban, What [is] this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you tricked me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said, It must not be done so in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you shall serve with me still another seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave Bilhah his slave woman to his daughter Rachel, to be her handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he also went in to Rachel. He also loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him still seven more years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when the LORD saw that Leah [was] hated, even He opened her womb. But Rachel [was] barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived and bore a son. And she called his name Reuben, for she said, Surely the LORD has looked upon my afflictions. Now therefore my husband will love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Because the LORD has heard that I was hated, He has therefore given me this [son] also. And she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will return to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said, This time I will praise the LORD. Therefore she called his name Judah, and quit bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
