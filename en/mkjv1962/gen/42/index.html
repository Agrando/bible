Go down there and buy for us from there, so that we may live and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob did not send with his brothers. For he said, Lest perhaps mischief happen to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joseph [was] the potentate over the land. He was] the one selling to all the people of the earth. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down themselves before him, their faces to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but remained a stranger to them, and spoke roughly to them. And he said to them, Where do you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, You [are] spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said to him, No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We [are] all one man's sons. We are honest; your servants are not spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to them, No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said, Your servants [are] twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. And behold, the youngest [is] this day with our father, and one [is] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph said to them, That [is] what I spoke to you, saying, You [are] spies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>By this you shall be proved; [as] Pharaoh lives you shall not go forth from here unless your youngest brother comes here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and you shall be kept in prison so that your words may be proved, whether [any] truth [is] in you. Or else, [as] Pharaoh lives, surely you [are] spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he put them together into custody three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said to them the third day, Do [this] and live. I fear God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you [are] honest, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your prison. You go carry grain [for] the famine of your houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But bring your youngest brother to me, and let your words be] confirmed, be proved true, and you shall not die. And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said one to another, We [are] truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he begged us, and we would not hear. Therefore this distress has come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you saying, Do not sin against the youth? And you would not hear. Therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned from them, and wept. And he returned to them again and talked with them, and took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Joseph commanded their sacks to be filled [with] grain, and returned their silver, each into his sack, and to give them provision for the way. And so he did to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they loaded their asses with grain, and departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass fodder in the inn, he saw his silver. For, behold, it [was] in the mouth of the sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to his brothers, My silver has been put back. And, also look in my sack. And their hearts failed, and they each were afraid, saying to one another, What [is] this God has done to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that happened to them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we said to him, We [are] honest, we [are] not spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One [is] not, and the youngest [is] this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this I shall know that you [are] honest. Leave one, your brother, with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you [are] not spies, but that you [are] honest. And I will deliver you your brother, and you shall trade in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it happened they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of silver [was] in his sack. And when they and their father saw the bundles of silver, they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me. Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and you will take Benjamin. All these things are against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, My son shall not go down with you. For his brother is dead, and he is left alone. And [if] mischief should happen to him by the way you go, then you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
