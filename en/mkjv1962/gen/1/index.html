And darkness [was] on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God saw the light that [it was] good. And God divided between the light and the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And God called the light, Day. And He called the darkness, Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And God said, Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters [from] the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God made the expanse, and divided the waters which [were] under the expanse from the waters which [were] above the expanse; and it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God called the expanse, Heavens. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And God called the dry land, Earth. And He called the gathering together of the waters, Seas. And God saw that [it was] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God said, Let the earth bring forth tender sprouts ( the] herb seeding seed [and] the fruit tree producing fruit after its kind, whose seed [is] in itself) upon the earth; and it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the earth brought forth tender sprouts, [the] herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree producing fruit after its kind, whose seed [was] in itself. And God saw that [it was] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to divide between the day and the night. And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth. And it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night, and the stars [also.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and to rule over the day and over the night; and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that [it was] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God said, Let the waters swarm [with] swarmers [having] a living soul; and let birds fly over the earth on the face of the expanse of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And God created great sea-animals, and every living soul that creeps [with] which the waters swarmed after their kind; and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that [it was] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the seas and let the fowl multiply in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creepers, and its beasts of the earth after its kind; and it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And God made the beasts of the earth after its kind, and cattle after their kind, and all creepers upon the earth after their kind. And God saw that it was good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creepers creeping on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And God created man in His image; in the image of God He created him. He created them male and female.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it. And have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heavens, and all animals that move upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And God said, Behold! I have given you every herb seeding seed which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which [is the] fruit of a tree seeding seed; to you it shall be for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every creeper on the earth which [has] in it a living soul every green plant [is] for food; and it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
