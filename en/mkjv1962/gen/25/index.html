And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sons of Midian: Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these [were] the sons of Keturah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son while he still lived, eastward to the east country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And these [are] the days of the years of Abraham's life, which he lived: a hundred seventy-five years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, old and satisfied. And he was gathered to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] before Mamre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth. Abraham and Sarah his wife were buried there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after the death of Abraham, it happened that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac lived by The Well of the Living One, My Beholder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And these [are] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations. The first-born of Ishmael was Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hadad, and Tema and Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These [were] the sons of Ishmael, and these [were] their names, by their towns and by their settlements; [twelve] chiefs according to their nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these [were] the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred thirty-seven years. And he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they lived from Havilah to Shur, which [is] before Egypt, [as] you go toward Assyria. And he died in the presence of all his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And these [were] the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham fathered Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she [was] barren. And the LORD heard him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the sons struggled together within her. And she said, If [it is] so, why [am] I this way? And she went to inquire of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said to her, Two nations [are] in your womb, and two kinds of people shall be separated from your bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people, the older shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, twins [were] in her womb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after that his brother came out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac [was] sixty years old when she bore them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the boys grew. And Esau was a man knowing hunting, and Jacob was a simple man, living in tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Isaac loved Esau, for game was in [his] mouth. But Rebekah loved Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob boiled soup. And Esau came from the field, and he was faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Esau said to Jacob, I beg you, Let me eat of the red, this red [soup], for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob said, Sell me your birthright today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point of dying, and what [profit shall] this birthright be to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day. And he swore to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and soup of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rose up and went his way. And Esau despised [his] birthright.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
