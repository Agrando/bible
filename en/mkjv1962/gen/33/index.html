And behold, Esau came, and four hundred men with him. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he put the slave women and their children first, and Leah and her children afterward, and Rachel and Joseph last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell upon his neck and kissed him. And they wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the boys, and said, Who [are] these [with] you? And he said, The boys with] whom God has favored your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the slave women came near, they and their boys, and they bowed themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Leah also, and her children, came near and bowed themselves. And afterward Joseph and Rachel came near and bowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He asked, Whose [is] all this camp which I met? And he said, To find grace in the sight of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Esau said, I have enough, my brother. Keep what you have yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob said, No, please, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand. For therefore have I seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Please take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he accepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to him, My lord knows that the boys are tender, and the flocks and herds with me [are] suckling. And if the men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on softly, according as the flocks that go before me, and the boys, are able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Esau said, Let me now leave with you [some] of the people with me. And he said, Why this? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house, and made booths for his cattle. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram. And he pitched his tent in front of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he bought a piece of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he erected there an altar, and called it El, the God of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
