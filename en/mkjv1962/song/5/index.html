Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O Beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I sleep, but my heart is awake. [It is] the sound of my Beloved that knocks, [saying], Open to Me, My sister, My love, My dove, My undefiled; for My head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have put off My coat; How shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My Beloved put in His hand by the hole [of the door], and my heart was moved for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I rose up to open to my Beloved; and my hands dripped [with] myrrh, and my fingers flowing [with] myrrh on the handles of the bolt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had left. He passed on. My soul went out when He spoke; I sought Him, but I could not find Him. I called Him, but He did not answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The watchmen who went about the city found me [and] struck me; they wounded me. The keepers of the wall lifted my veil from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my Beloved, what do you tell Him? That I [am] sick [with] love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What [is] your Beloved more than [another] beloved, most beautiful among women? What [is] your Beloved more than [another] beloved, that you adjure us so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My Beloved [is] bright and ruddy, standing out among ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head [is like] refined gold; His locks [are] bushy, black as a raven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes [are] as doves' [eyes] on the rivers of waters, washed with milk, sitting on a setting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His cheeks [are] like a bed of spices, a raised bed of aromatic herbs. His lips [are as] lilies dropping flowing myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His hands [are like] rings of gold filled with jewels; His body an ivory plate overlaid with sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His legs [are like] pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold; His face [is like] Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His mouth [is] most sweet; yes, He [is] altogether lovely.
