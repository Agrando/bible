Yet I have not been justified by this, but He who judges me is [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall each one have praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And these things, brothers, I have [in a figure] transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that you might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, so that no one of you may [be] puffed up against one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who makes you to differ [from another]? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive [it], why do you boast as [if you] had not received it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Already you are full! Already you are rich! You have reigned [as kings] without us! And oh that indeed you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think that God has set forth us last, the apostles, as it were appointed to death; for we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We [are] fools for Christ's sake, but you [are] wise in Christ. We [are] weak, but you [are] strong. You [are] honorable, but we [are] despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even until this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all [things] until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn [you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [you do] not [have] many fathers; for I have begotten you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore I beseech you, be imitators of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this cause I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved son and faithful in [the] Lord, who shall remind you [of] my ways which are] in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As to my not coming to you now, some are puffed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills. And I will not know the speech of those who are puffed up, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or [in] love and the spirit of meekness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
