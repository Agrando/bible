And likewise also the husband does not have authority [over his] own body, but the wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do not deprive one another, unless [it is] with consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. And come together again so that Satan does not tempt you for your incontinence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I speak this according to permission, not according to commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I would that all men were even as I myself am. But each has his proper gift from God, one according to this manner and another according to that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say therefore to the unmarried and the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And to the married I command (not I, but the Lord), a woman not to be separated from [her] husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if she is indeed separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband. And a husband is not to leave [his] wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But to the rest I speak, not the Lord, If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is pleased to dwell with him, do not let him put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is pleased to dwell with her, do not let her leave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbelieving one separates, let [him] be separated. A brother or a sister is not in bondage in such [cases], but God has called us in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For what do you know, O wife, whether you shall save [your] husband? Or what do you know, O man, whether you shall save [your] wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[Was] any called having been circumcised? Do not be uncircumcised. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? Do not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let each one remain in the calling in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you called as a slave? It does not matter to you, but if you are able to become free, use [it] rather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he who is called a slave in [the] Lord is a freed man of [the] Lord. And likewise, he who is called a free man is a slave of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You are bought with a price, do not be the slaves of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Each in whatever way he was called, brothers, in this remain with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But concerning virgins, I have no commandment from [the] Lord. Yet I give my judgment, as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then I think this is good, because of the present necessity; that [it is] good for a man to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if you do marry, you did not sin; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such shall have trouble in the flesh, but I spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brothers, The time [is] short. It remains that both those who have wives should be as not having one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they who weep are as [though they did] not weep. And they who rejoice are as [though they did] not rejoice. And they who buy are as though they did] not possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they who use this world are] as not abusing [it], for the fashion of this world is passing away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I desire you to be without anxiety. The [one] who is unmarried cares for the things that belong to [the] Lord, how to please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the [one] who is married cares for the things of the world, how to please [his] wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The wife and the virgin [are] different. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please [her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is right, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if anyone thinks [it] behaving himself indecently toward his virgin (if she is past [her] prime, and so it ought to be) let him do what he will; he does not sin; let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But [he] who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but who has authority over [his] own will (and has so judged in his heart that he will keep his virginity) he does well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then he who gives in marriage does well. But he who does not give in marriage does better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives, but if her husband sleeps in death, she is at liberty to be remarried to whom she will, only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier if she so remains, according to my judgment. And I also think that I have [the] Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
