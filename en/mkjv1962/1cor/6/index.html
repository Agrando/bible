And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not to mention the things] of this] life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If, then, you truly have judgments of [the things] of this] life, set those who are least esteemed in the church [to judge].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For I speak to your shame. [Is it] so [that] there is not a wise one among you, not even one in your midst who shall be able to judge between his brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Indeed then there is already on the whole a failure among you, that you have lawsuits with yourselves. Why not instead be wronged? Why not instead be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you do wrong and defraud, and these things to brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor abusers, nor homosexuals,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you. But you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats for the belly and the belly for meats, but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God has both raised up the Lord, and also will raise us up by His own power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make [them] the members of a harlot? Let it not be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or do you not know that he being joined to a harlot is one body? For He says, The two shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he being joined to the Lord is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against [his] own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit in you, whom you have of God? And you are not your own,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for you are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
