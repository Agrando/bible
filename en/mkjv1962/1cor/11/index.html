But [if it] is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a man indeed ought not to have [his] head covered, because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is [the] glory of [the] man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nor was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this reason the woman ought to have authority on [her] head because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the woman [is] of the man, even so the man [is] also through the woman; but all things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge among yourselves: is it right that a woman pray to God unveiled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not even nature itself teach you that if man has long hair, it is a shame to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a woman should have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her in place of a veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But in enjoining this, I do not praise [you], because you come together not for the better, but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must also be heresies among you, that the approved ones may be revealed among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore when you come together into one place, [this] is not to eat [the] Lord's supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For in eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry, and another drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For do you not have houses [in which] to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God, and shame those who do not have? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? I do not praise [you] !</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And giving thanks, He broke [it] and said, Take, eat; this is My body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way [He took] the cup also, after supping, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood; as often as you drink it, do this in remembrance of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until He shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So that whoever shall eat this bread and drink [this] cup of the Lord unworthily, he will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread and drink of that cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he who eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause many among you [are] weak and sickly, and many sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged, we are chastened by [the] Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So that, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But if anyone hungers, let him eat at home, so that you do not come together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
