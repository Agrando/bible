Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides these, I do not know if I baptized any other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel; not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those being lost, but to us being saved, [it is] the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the perceiving ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where [is the] wise? Where [is the] scribe? Where [is the] lawyer of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world [by] wisdom did not know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Jews ask for a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to them, the called-out ones, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is] the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise men according to the flesh [are called], not many mighty, not many noble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and God has chosen the base things of the world, and things which are despised, and things which are not, in order to bring to nothing things that are;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that no flesh should glory in His presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that, according as it is written, He who glories, let him glory in [the] Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
