The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we, the many, are one bread [and] one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold Israel after the flesh. Are not those who eat of the sacrifices also partakers of the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What then do I say? That the idol is anything, or that an idolatrous sacrifice is anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But [I say] that the things which the nations sacrifice, [they] sacrifice to demons and not to God. And I do not desire that you should have fellowship with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You cannot drink [the] cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot be partakers of [the] Lord's table and of a table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful to me, but not all things build up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one seek his own, but each one another's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no question for conscience' sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the earth [is] the Lord's, and the fullness of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any of those who do not believe invite you [to a feast], and if you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if anyone says to you, This is slain in sacrifice to idols, do not eat for the sake of him who showed [it], and for conscience' sake; for the earth [is] the Lord's, and the fullness of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's.
