For no one hears, but in spirit he speaks mysteries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But he who prophesies speaks to men [for] building up, and exhortation, and comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The one speaking in a tongue builds himself up, but he prophesying builds up a church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I wish all of you to speak in languages, but rather that you may prophesy; for greater [is] he prophesying than he speaking in tongues, unless he interpret so that the church may receive building up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet lifeless things giving a sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sound, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For also if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So also you, if you do not give a clear word through the language, how will it be known what [is] being said? For you will be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So it may be many kinds of sounds are in [the] world, and not one [is] without a distinct sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore if I do not know the power of the sound, I will be a foreigner to him speaking, and he speaking [will be] a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Even so you, since you are zealots of spiritual [things], seek to build up the church, in order that you may abound</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So then he speaking in a language, let him pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Else, if you bless in the spirit, he occupying the place of the unlearned, how will he say the amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not built up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank my God [that] I speak more languages than all of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yet in a church I desire to speak five words with my mind, so that I might also teach others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, do not be children in your minds, but in malice be like infants, and in your minds be mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, By other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people, and even so they will not hear Me, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that tongues are not a sign to those who believe, but to those who do not believe. But prophesying [is] not to those who do not believe, but to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if the whole church has come together, and all speak in languages, and if uninstructed ones or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you rave?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or one not instructed comes, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And so the secrets of his heart become revealed. And so, falling down on [his] face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then how is it, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be for building up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If one speaks in a language, [let it be] by two, or [at] the most three, and in succession. And let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in a church; and let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And [if there are] two or three prophets, let them speak, and let the others judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If [a revelation] is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you may all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the spirits of the prophets [are] subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the Law also says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in a church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or did the Word of God go out from you? Or did it reach only to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone thinks to be a prophet, or a spiritual one, let him recognize the things I write to you, that they are a commandment of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So then, brothers, seek to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
