If all hearing, where [would be] the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body as it has pleased Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they were all one member, where [would be] the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now indeed many [are] the members, yet only one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But much rather the members of the body seeming to be weaker are necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those [members] of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we put more abundant honor around [them]. And our unpresentable [members] have more abundant propriety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For our presentable [members] have no need, but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the [member] having need;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there not be division in the body, but [that] the members should have the same care for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with [it]; if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you are the body of Christ, and members in part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God set some in the church, firstly, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers, then works of power, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, kinds of languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[Are] all apostles? [Are] all prophets? [Are] all teachers? [Are] all workers of power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak languages? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But zealously strive after the better gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
