Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in [the] Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My answer to those who examine me is this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do we not have authority to eat and to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do we not have authority to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brothers of the Lord do, and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or [is it] only Barnabas and I [who] have no authority whether] not to work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who serves as a soldier at his own wages at any time? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do I say these things according to man? Or does not the Law say the same also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle an ox threshing grain. Does God take care for oxen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or does He say [it] altogether for our sakes? It was written for us, so that he who plows should plow [in] hope, and so that he who threshes [in] hope should be partaker of his hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we have sown to you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others have a share of [this] authority [over] you, rather [should] not we? But we have not used this authority, but we endured all things lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do you not know that those who minister about holy things live [of the things] of the temple? And those attending the altar are partakers with the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so, the Lord ordained those announcing the gospel to live from the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should be done so to me; for [it is] good for me rather to die than that anyone nullify my glorying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For though I preach the gospel, no glory is to me. For necessity is laid on me; yea, woe is to me if I do not preach the gospel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For though I am free from all, yet I have made myself servant to all, so that I might gain the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might gain the Jews. To those who are under the Law, [I became] as under the Law, so that I might gain those who are under the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To those who are outside Law, [I became] as outside Law (not being outside law to God, but under [the] law to Christ), so that I might gain those who are outside Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak I became as the weak, so that I might gain the weak. I am made all things to all [men], so that I might by all means save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this I do for the sake of the gospel, so that I might be partaker of it [with you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do you not know that those running in a race all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And everyone who strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Then those truly that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So then I run, not as if I were uncertain. And so I fight, not as [one who] beats the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I buffet my body, and lead [it] captive, lest proclaiming to others I myself might be rejected.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
