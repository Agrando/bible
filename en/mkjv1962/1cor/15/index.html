But when He says that all things have been put under [His feet], it is plain that [it] excepts Him who has put all things under Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subject to Him who has subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all things in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, what will they do, those being baptized on behalf of [the] dead? If the dead are not at all raised, why indeed are they baptized on behalf of [the] dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why are we also in danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Day by day I die, by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If according to man I fought with beasts in Ephesus, what advantage is to me if [the] dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be deceived; evil companionships corrupt good habits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Be righteously awake, and sin not; for some have ignorance of God. I speak [this] to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will say, How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Foolish one! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what you sow, you do not sow the body that [is] going to be, but a bare grain (perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And God gives it a body as it has pleased Him, and to each of the seeds its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh [is] not the same flesh; but one [kind of] flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fish, and another of birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>[There are] also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly [is] truly different, and that of the earthly different;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>one glory of [the] sun, and another glory of [the] moon, and another glory of [the] stars; for [one] star differs from [another] star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And so it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul, the last Adam was a life-giving Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But not the spiritual first, but the natural; afterward the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man [was] out of earth, earthy; the second Man [was] the Lord from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Such the earthy [man], such also the earthy ones. And such the heavenly [Man], such also the heavenly ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And according as we bore the image of the earthy [man], we shall also bear the image of the heavenly [Man].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit [the] kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I speak a mystery to you; we shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in a glance of an eye, at the last trumpet. For a trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and when this mortal shall put on immortality, then will take place the word that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O death, where [is] your sting? O grave, where [is] your victory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death [is] sin, and the strength of sin [is] the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks [be] to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>So that, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not without fruit in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
