For in that [there is] among you envyings and strife and divisions, are you not carnal, and [do you not] walk according to men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are you not carnal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then neither is he who plants anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So he planting, and he watering, are one, and each one shall receive [his] own reward according to [his] own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For of God we are fellow-workers, a field of God, and you are a building of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds [on it]. But let every man be careful how he builds [on it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For any other foundation can no one lay than the one] being laid, who is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if anyone builds on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>each one's work shall be revealed. For the Day shall declare [it], because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try each one's work as to what kind it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If anyone's work which he built remains, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If anyone's work shall be burned up, he shall suffer loss. But he shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again,  The] Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether it is Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and you are Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
