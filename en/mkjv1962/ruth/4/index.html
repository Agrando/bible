And behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by. And he said, Such a one! Turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, Come sit down here. And they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, who has come again out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land which [was] our brother Elimelech's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I said I will tell it in your ear, saying, Buy [it] before those who live here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem, redeem [it]. But if you will not redeem, tell me so that I may know. For there is none to redeem besides you. And I am after you. And he said, I will redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Boaz said, In the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy also from the hand of Ruth of Moab, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance. You redeem my right to yourself, for I cannot redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this [was the custom] in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, to confirm everything. A man plucked off his sandal and gave it to his neighbor. And this was a testimony in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy [it] for yourself. So he drew off his sandal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, You [are] witnesses this day that I have bought all that [was] Elimelech's and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And also Ruth of Moab, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, so that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You  are] witnesses this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people in the gate, and the elders, said, We [are] witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, for these two built the house of Israel. And may you be blessed in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And let your house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give you of this young woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife. And when he went in to her, the LORD made her conceive. And she bore a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the women said to Naomi, Blessed [be] the LORD, who has not left you this day without a redeemer, so that his name may be famous in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he shall be to you as a restorer of life, and one who cheers your old age. For your daughter-in-law who loves you has borne him, she who is better to you than seven sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they called his name Obed. He [is] the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these [are] the generations of Pharez. Pharez fathered Hezron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
