Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing-floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore wash yourself, and anoint yourself, and put your clothing upon you, and go down to the floor. Do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he lies down, you mark the place where he lies, and you shall go in and uncover his feet and lie down. And he will tell you what you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she said to her, All that you say, I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she went down to the grain floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had told her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Boaz had eaten and had drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap. And she came softly and uncovered his feet, and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened at midnight, the man trembled and turned himself. And, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Who [are] you? And she answered, I [am] your handmaid Ruth. And you shall spread your skirt over your handmaid, for you [are] a kinsman-redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said, Blessed [be] you of the LORD, my daughter. You have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, in that you did not follow young men, whether poor or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do to you all that you ask. For all the city of my people knows that you [are] a woman of virtue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now it is true that I [am] your kinsman-redeemer. But there is also a kinsman nearer than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Stay tonight, and it shall be in the morning, if he will redeem you, well; he will redeem. And if he does not delight to redeem you, [as] the LORD lives, then I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Do not let it be known that a woman came to the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also, he said, Bring the veil on you, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six [measures] of barley and laid it on her. And she went to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who [are] you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said, These six [measures] of barley he gave to me. For he said to me, Do not go empty to your mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall. For the man will not rest until he has finished the thing today.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
