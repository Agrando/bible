They sacrifice to the Baals, and burn incense to graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I also taught Ephraim to go; He took them on His arm. But they did not know that I healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as those who take off the yoke on their jaws, and I gently give food to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He shall not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian [shall be] his king, because they refused to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sword shall remain on his cities, and shall destroy his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And My people are bent on backsliding from Me.

How shall I make you like Admah? How shall I set you as Zeboim? My heart is turned within Me; My compassions are kindled together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will not carry out the heat of My anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim. For I [am] God and not man, the Holy One in your midst; and I will not enter into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall walk after the LORD; He shall roar like a lion. When He shall roar, then the sons shall tremble from the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They shall tremble like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of Assyria. And I will place them in their houses, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ephraim [circles] around Me with lying, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah still rules with God, and is faithful with the saints.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
