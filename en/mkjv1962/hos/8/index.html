[He comes] like an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have broken My covenant and have sinned against My law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Israel shall cry to Me, My God, we know You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Israel has thrown off good; the enemy shall pursue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They have set up kings, but not by Me; they have made rulers, and I knew it not. They have made themselves idols [with] their silver and their gold, so that they may be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Your calf, O Samaria, has cast [you] off. My anger is kindled against them. Until when will they not attain purity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For from Israel it [came] also. The craftsman made it, but [it is] not God. For the calf of Samaria shall be splinters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For they sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind. It has no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal; if it does yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Israel is swallowed up; now they shall be among the nations as a vessel in which there is no pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now I will gather them. And they began to be few, from the burden of the king of rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have written to him the great things of My law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of My offerings, and eat it; but the LORD does not receive them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return [to] Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples. And Judah has multiplied cities. But I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall burn up her palaces.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
