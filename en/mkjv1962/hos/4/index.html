For the LORD [has] a quarrel with the people of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There is lying, and swearing, and killing, and stealing, and the committing of adultery; and blood touches blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore the land shall mourn, and everyone who dwells in it shall droop, with the beasts of the field and with the birds of the heavens. Yes, the fish of the sea shall also be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another. For your people [are] as those who strive with the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with you [in the] night, and I will cut off your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you from being priest to Me. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your sons, even I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As they were increased, so they sinned against Me. I will change their glory into shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They eat up the sin of My people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it has become, Like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them for their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they shall eat and not have enough. They shall fornicate and not increase, because they have stopped taking heed to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Fornication and wine and new wine take away the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My people seek advice from their wooden [idols], and their rod declares to them. For the spirit of harlotry has caused them to go astray, and they have gone lusting away from under their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because its shade is good. So your daughters shall be harlots, and your brides shall commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will not punish your daughters when they fornicate, nor your wives when they commit adultery. For the men themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes. The people [who] do not understand are thrown down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though you, Israel, fornicate, yet do not let Judah become guilty. And do not come [to] Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, nor swear, [As] the LORD lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Israel slides back like a backsliding heifer. Now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ephraim [is] joined to idols; let him alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their drink is sour; they are continually fornicating; her rulers dearly love shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The wind has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
