For they have worked falsehood. And the thief comes in, the troop of robbers plunders outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they do not say within their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their own doings have hemmed them in; they are before My face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They make the king glad with their evil, and the rulers with their lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They [are] all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker; he stops stirring, from kneading the dough, while it is leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[In] the day of our king, the rulers have sickened themselves [with] the heat of wine. He stretches out his hand with scorners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For they have brought their heart near like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps at night; in the morning it burns like a flaming fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen; there is none among them who calls to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ephraim mixed himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Strangers have eaten up his strength, and he does not know. Yea, gray hairs are here and there on him, yet he knows it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. And they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek Him in all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart; they call [to] Egypt; they go [to] Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they go, I will spread My net on them; I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as a report to their congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to them! For they have fled from Me. Ruin to them! Because they have sinned against Me. Though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they have not cried to Me with their heart, when they howled on their beds; they gather themselves for grain and wine, and they rebel against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet they think evil against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They return, but not to the [Most] High. They are like a deceitful bow; their rulers shall fall by the sword from the rage of their tongue. This [shall be] their scorn in the land of Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
