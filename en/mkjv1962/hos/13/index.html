They say of them, Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff storm-driven out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet I [am] the LORD your God from the land of Egypt, and you shall know no God but Me. For there is no Savior besides Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have known you in the wilderness, in the land of great dryness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>According to their pasture, so were they filled. They were filled and their heart was lifted up. Therefore they have forgotten Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore I will be as a lion to them; as a leopard by the way I will watch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I will meet them like a bereaved bear, and will tear the lining of their heart. And there I will devour them like a lion; the wild beast shall tear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Israel, you have destroyed yourself; but in Me [is] your help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Where [is] your king now, that he may save you in all your cities; and your judges of whom you said, Give me a king and rulers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I gave you a king in My anger, and took [him] away in My wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The pains of a woman in travail shall come to him. He [is] an unwise son; for he cannot stand still in the time of the breaking forth of sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death. O Death, where [are] your plagues; O Grave, where [is] your ruin! Repentance shall be hidden from My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come. The wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall be ashamed, and his fountain shall be dried up. He shall plunder the treasure of all desirable vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Samaria shall become a waste, for she has rebelled against her God. They shall fall by the sword. Their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women shall be ripped up.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
