According to the multitude of his fruit, he has increased the altars. They have made beautiful images according to the goodness of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Their heart is divided; now they shall be guilty. He shall break down their altars, and He shall spoil their images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For now they shall say, We have no king because we did not fear the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant. So judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because of the calves of Beth-aven, the people of Samaria shall dread. For its people shall mourn over it, and its priest rejoiced on it for its glory, because it has departed from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It shall also be carried to Assyria for a present to king Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As for Samaria, her king is cut off as a bough on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah. There they stood; the battle against the sons of iniquity did not overtake them in Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When I desire, I shall bind them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves to their two perversities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Ephraim [is] like a trained heifer, trying to tread out. But I passed over on the goodness of her neck. I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground. For [it is] time to seek the LORD, until He comes and rains righteousness on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You have plowed wickedness; you have reaped iniquity; you have eaten the fruit of lies, because you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And an uproar shall arise among your peoples, and all your fortresses shall be spoiled, as the ruin [of] Beth-arbel by Shalman in the day of battle. The mother was dashed in pieces on [her] sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So He does to you, Bethel, because of your great evil. In a morning the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
