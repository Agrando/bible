Contend with your mother, for she [is] not my wife, nor am I her husband. Let her therefore put away her fornications out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>lest I strip her naked and set her out as in the day that she was born; and lest I make her as the wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will not have mercy on her sons, for they [are] the sons of adulteries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For their mother has prostituted [herself]. She who conceived them has done shamefully. For she said, I will go after my lovers who give my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore behold, I will hedge your way with thorns, and wall up her wall, that she shall not find her paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them. She shall seek them, but shall not find [them]. Then she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then [it was] better with me than now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For she did not know that I gave her grain, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, [which] they prepared for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I will return and take away My grain in its time, and my wine in its season, and will recover my wool and my flax [given] to cover her nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now I will uncover her shamefulness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will also cause all her joy to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her appointed feasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, They [are] my rewards that my lovers have given me. And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will visit on her the days of the Baals, in which she burned incense to them, and she adorned herself with her nose-rings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers and forgot Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, I will lure her and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will give her vineyards to her from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope. And she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be at that day, says the LORD, you shall call Me, My Husband, and shall no more call Me, My Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they will no more be remembered by their name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day I will cut a covenant for them, with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and [with] the creeping things of the ground. And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will betroth you to Me forever. Yea, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will even betroth you to Me in faithfulness. And you shall know the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will be, in that day I will answer, says the LORD. I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the earth shall hear the grain and the wine and the oil. And they shall hear Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sow her to Me in the earth. And I will have mercy on No-mercy. And I will say to Not-my-people, You are My people. And they shall say, My God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
