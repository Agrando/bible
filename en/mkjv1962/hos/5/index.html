And give ear, house of the king. For judgment [is] toward you, because you have been a snare on Mizpah and a net spread on Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And revolters have gone deep [in] slaughtering, and I chasten all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. For now, O Ephraim, you have fornicated; Israel is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their doings will not allow [them] to turn to their God; for the spirit of fornication [is] in their midst, and they have not known the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. So Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find Him. He has withdrawn Himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have acted treacherously against the LORD, for they have brought out strange sons. Now a new moon shall devour them with their portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah; cry aloud at Beth-aven, after you, O Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I have made known that which is confirmed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The rulers of Judah were like movers of a border; I will pour out My wrath on them like water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ephraim [is] crushed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I [am] as a moth to Ephraim, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then Ephraim went to the Assyrian and sent to king Jareb. Yet he could not heal you nor cure you of your wound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For I [will be] to Ephraim as a lion, and as a strong lion to the house of Judah. I, [even] I, will tear and go away. I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will go; I will return to My place until they confess their guilt and seek My face; in their affliction they will seek Me diligently.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
