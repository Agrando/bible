For you have gone lusting away from your God; you have loved a reward on every grain floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They shall not pour wine to the LORD, nor shall they be pleasing to Him. Their sacrifices [shall be] like the bread of sorrows to them; all who eat of them shall be defiled. For their bread is for their soul, it shall not come into the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>What will you do in the day of meeting, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For lo, they have left because of destruction. Egypt shall gather them up; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess the desirable things of their silver; thorns [shall be] in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The days of her judgment have come; the days of vengeance have come; Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man [is] insane, because of the greatness of your iniquity and the great hatred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The watchman of Ephraim [was] with my God. The prophet [is] a snare of a fowler in all his ways, [and] hatred in the house of his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They have deeply corrupted, as [in] days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first-fruit in the fig tree at her first time. But they went [to] Baal-peor and set themselves apart to a shameful thing; and they became abominable like that which they loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ephraim is like a bird; their glory shall fly away from birth, and from the womb, and from conception.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Though they bring up their sons, yet I will make them childless, without a man. Yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ephraim, when I looked toward Tyre, was planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim shall bring out his sons to the murderer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Give them, O Lord; what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All their wickedness [is] in Gilgal, for there I hated them. I will drive them out of My house for the wickedness of their doings. I will love them no more; all their rulers [are] revolters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ephraim is stricken; their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit. Yea, though they bear, yet I will slay the beloved ones of their womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My God shall cast them away because they did not listen to Him. And they shall be wanderers among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
