You shall make them of beaten work. And they shall be used for the calling of the assembly and for causing the camps to go forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall gather themselves to you at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if they blow with one, then the rulers [who are] heads of the thousands of Israel shall gather themselves to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When you blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall pull up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall pull up. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when the congregation is to be gathered, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets. And they shall be to you for an ordinance forever throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if you go to war in your land against the enemy who fights against you, then you shall blow with the trumpets. And you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, so that they may be to you for a memorial before your GOD. I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And on the twentieth of the second month, in the second year, the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sons of Israel pulled up in their journeyings out of the wilderness of Sinai.
