And Balak and Balaam offered on the altar a bull and a ram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me. And whatever He reveals to me I will tell you. And he went to a high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God met Balaam. And he said to Him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon the altar a bull and a ram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, Return to Balak, and so you shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned to him. And lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the leaders of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, [saying], Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? Or how shall I defy [whom] the LORD has not defied?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. Lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be counted among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have kept on blessing [them] !</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he answered and said, Must I not be careful to speak that which the LORD has put in my mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place from where you may see them. You shall see only their edge, and shall not see them all. And curse them from there for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on [every] altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet Him yonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak and say this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, What has the LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he took up his parable and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear. Listen to me, son of Zippor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God [is] not a man that He should lie, neither the son of man that He should repent. Has He said, and shall He not do it? Or has He spoken, and shall He not make it good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, I have received word to bless. And He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He has not seen iniquity in Jacob, neither has He seen perverseness in Israel. The LORD his God [is] with him, and the shout of a king among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>God brought them out of Egypt. He has, as it were, the strength of an ox.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Surely, [there is] no spell against Jacob, nor any fortune-telling against Israel. According to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What God has worked!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, the people shall rise up like a great lion, and lift up himself like a young lion. He shall not lie down until he eats [of] the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell you, saying, All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Balak said to Balaam, Please, come. I will bring you into another place. Perhaps it will please God that you will curse them for me from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor that looks toward Jeshimon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Build seven altars here for me, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams here for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on the altar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
