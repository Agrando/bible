Until all the days are fulfilled in which he separates to the LORD, he shall be holy.

But the former days shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this [is] the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled. He shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he shall offer his offering to the LORD: one male lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour, cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their food offerings and their drink offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest shall bring [them] before the LORD and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he shall offer the ram [for] a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread.
