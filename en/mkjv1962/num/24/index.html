And the Spirit of God came upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he has said; he who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling down but having his eyes open;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your tabernacles, O Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They are spread forth like the valleys, like gardens by the river's side, like the trees of aloes which the LORD has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters. And his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>God brought him forth out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of an ox. He shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through [with] his arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He crouched. He lay down as a lion, and as a great lion. Who shall stir him up? Blessed is he who blesses you, and cursed is he who curses you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam. And he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have kept on blessing these three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore now flee to your place. I thought to lift you up to great honor, but lo, the LORD has kept you back from honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak also to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the mouth of the LORD, to do good or bad of my own mind. What the LORD said, that I will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now, behold, I go to my people. Come! I will make known to you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes [are] open has said;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>he has said, he who heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down but having his eyes open;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I shall see him, but not now. I shall behold him, but not near. There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel. and shall strike the corners of Moab, and destroy all the sons of tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Edom shall be a possession. Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies. And Israel shall do valiantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Out of Jacob shall come He who shall have dominion and shall destroy him who remains of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable and said, Amalek [was] the first of the nations. But his latter end [is] to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable and said, Strong is your dwelling-place, and you put your nest in a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Kenites shall be wasted until Assyria shall carry you away captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took up his parable and said, Alas, who shall live when God puts out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And ships shall come from the coast of Cyprus, and shall afflict Assyria and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place. And Balak also went his way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
