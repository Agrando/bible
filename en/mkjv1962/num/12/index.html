For he had taken a Cushite woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they said, Has the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? Has He not also spoken by us? And the LORD heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>(Now the man Moses [was] very meek, more than all the men on the face of the earth.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, You three come out to the tabernacle of the congregation. And the three came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood [in] the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both came forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said, Hear now My words. If there is a prophet among you, [I] the LORD will make Myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Not so, My servant Moses. He [is] faithful in all My house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I will speak with him mouth to mouth, even clearly, and not in dark speeches. And he shall behold the likeness of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and He moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the cloud moved from the tabernacle. And behold! Miriam [became] leprous, as snow. And Aaron looked on Miriam, and behold, [she was] leprous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not lay upon us the sin in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let her not be like one dead, of whom the flesh is half gone when he comes out of his mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses cried to the LORD saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days. And the people did not pull up until Miriam was brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And afterward the people moved from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
