And the LORD heard, and His anger was kindled. And the fire of the LORD burned among them and devoured in the outermost parts of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the people cried to Moses. And when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the mixed multitude in their midst lusted with [great] lust. And the sons of Israel also turned and wept, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now our soul [is] dried away; there is nothing at all besides this manna [before our] eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the manna [was] like coriander seed, and the color of it was like the color of bdellium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The people went around and gathered, and ground it in mills, or beat [it] in a mortar, and baked in pans, and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of fresh oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent. And the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly. Moses also was displeased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses said to the LORD, Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, so that You lay the burden of all this people upon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have I conceived all this people? Did I bring them forth, that You should say to me, Carry them in your bosom like a nursing father carries the sucking child, to the land which You swore to their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From where should I get flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because [it is] too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if You are going to part this way with me, I beg You to kill me at once, if I have found favor in Your sight, and let me not see my misery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and the officers over them. And bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation so that they may stand there with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take of the spirit on you, and will put [it] on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you so that you do not bear [it] yourself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh. For you have wept in the ears of the Lord, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat, for [it was] well with us in Egypt? Therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Even a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is hateful to you, because you have despised the LORD among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why did we come out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said, The people among whom I [am] [are] six hundred thousand footmen. And You have said, I will give them flesh so that they may eat a whole month!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall the flocks and the herds be killed for them, to be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be enough for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Has the LORD's hand become short? You shall see now whether or not My word shall come to pass to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them all around the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD came down in a cloud and spoke to him, and took of the spirit on him and gave [it] to the seventy elders. And it happened when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they never did so again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But two of the men stayed in the camp; the name of the one [was] Eldad, and the name of the other was Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. And they [were] of those who were written, but did not go out to the tabernacle. And they prophesied in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, [one] of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, make them cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And a wind went forth from the LORD. And it cut off quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits [high upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people stood up all that day and all night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails. And he that gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread [them] out for themselves all around the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the flesh [was] yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he called the name of that place Graves of Lust, because there they buried the people that lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>[And] the people pulled up from the Graves of Lust to Hazeroth, and stayed at Hazeroth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
