You shall put them outside the camp so that they do not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sons of Israel did so, and put them out outside the camp. Even as the LORD spoke to Moses, so the sons of Israel did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Speak to the sons of Israel: When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass against the LORD, and that person is guilty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then they shall confess their sin which they have done. And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it one fifth of it, and give [it] to him against whom he has sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if the man has no kinsman to whom he may make restitution for the guilt, the guilt which is restored [shall be] given to the LORD, to the priest, besides the ram of the atonement by which an atonement shall be made for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And every offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel which they shall bring to the priest, shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every man's devoted things shall be his. Whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, If any man's wife goes astray, and has committed a trespass against him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and a man lie with her carnally, and if it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and is kept hidden, and she is defiled, and [there is] no witness against her, neither is she taken in the act;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he is jealous of his wife, and she is defiled-- or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he is jealous of his wife, and she is not defiled--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. And he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth of an ephah of barley meal. He shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense on it, for it [ is] an offering of jealousy, a reminding offering, bringing iniquity to mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel. And the priest shall take of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle and put [it] into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the reminding offering in her hands, which [is] the jealousy offering. And the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causes the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband, you are free from this bitter water that causes the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if you have gone aside, being under your husband, and if you are defiled and some man besides your husband has given his semen to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing. And the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD makes your thigh to fall away and your belly to swell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels to make [your] belly swell and your thigh fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot [them] out with the bitter water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causes the curse. And the water that causes the curse shall enter into her [and become] bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the priest shall take a handful of the offering, as a memorial of it, and burn [it] upon the altar, and afterward [he] shall cause the woman to drink the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he has made her drink the water, then it shall be, if she is defiled and has committed a trespass against her husband, the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and [become bitter]. And her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away. And the woman shall be a curse among her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean, then she shall be clean, and shall conceive seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This [is] the law of jealousies when a woman goes aside, being under her husband, and is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and the woman shall bear her iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
