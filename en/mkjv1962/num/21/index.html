And they completely destroyed them and their cities. And he called the name of the place Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they pulled up from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the soul of the people was very discouraged because of the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For [there is] no bread, neither is there any water. And our soul hates this light bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people. And many people of Israel died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD that He take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole. And it shall be when everyone that is bitten, when he looks upon it, he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole. And it happened that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked upon the serpent of brass, he lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of Israel pulled up and pitched in Oboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they pulled up from Oboth and pitched at Ije-abarim in the wilderness before Moab, toward the sunrising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From there they pulled up and pitched in the valley of Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From there they pulled up and pitched on the other side of Arnon, in the wilderness that comes out of the borders of the Amorites; for Arnon [is] in the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, Waheb in Suphah, and in the torrents of Arnon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and at the stream of the torrents that goes down to the dwelling of Ar and lies upon the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from there [they went] to Beer. That is the well of which the LORD spoke to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well. Sing to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The well which the rulers dug, which the nobles of the people dug with their staves by [the word] of the Lawgiver. And from the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and from Bamoth [in] the valley, in the country of Moab, [they worked] to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let me pass through your land. We will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards. We will not drink the waters of the well. We will go along by the king's highway until we are past your borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border. But Sihon gathered all his people, and went out against Israel in the wilderness. And he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Israel struck him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon. For the border of the sons of Ammon [was] strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Israel took all these cities. And Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon, and in all its villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Heshbon [was] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore they who speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For there has gone out a fire from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons to be runaways, and his daughters to go into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We have cast them down. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah which [is] to Medeba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who [were] there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they struck him and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him alive. And they possessed his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
