And these [are] the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest, and before the rulers and all the congregation, [by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of those who gathered themselves against the LORD in the company of Korah, but died in his own sin, and had no sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he has no son? Therefore give us a possession among the brothers of our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. You shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers. And you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his nearest relative, of his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be to the sons of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Get up into this Mount Abarim and see the land which I have given to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people as Aaron your brother was gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For you rebelled against My command in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify Me at the water before their eyes; they [were] the Waters of Strife in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>who may go out before them, and who may go in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD may not be as sheep which have no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom [is] the Spirit, and lay your hand upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation, and give him a charge in their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall put of your honor on him, so that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may be obedient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask for him according to the judgment of Urim before the LORD.
