Why then do you lift yourselves up above the congregation of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses heard and fell on his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even tomorrow the LORD will show [who are] His, and him who is holy, and will cause him to come near to Him; even him whom He has chosen, He will cause to come near to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do this. Take fire-pans, Korah and all his company,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and put fire in them, and put incense in them before the LORD tomorrow. And it shall be the man whom the LORD chooses, he [shall be] holy. You take too much upon you, sons of Levi!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said to Korah, Hear now you sons of Levi;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[is it] only a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near Himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you. And do you seek the priesthood also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this cause you and all your company [are] gathered against the LORD. And what is Aaron, that you murmur against him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. And they said, We will not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>[Is it] a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but must you also seize dominion over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Besides, you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance in fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses was very angry, and said to the LORD, Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses said to Korah, Stand before the LORD, you and all your company-- you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And every man take his fire-pan and put incense in them, and let every man bring his fire-pan before the LORD, two hundred and fifty fire-pans, you also, and Aaron, each with his fire-pan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And every man took his fire-pan and put fire in them, and laid incense on it, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, so that I may devour them in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they fell upon their faces and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin and will You be angry with all the congregation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Speak to the congregation saying, Get away from the tent of Korah and Dathan and Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram. And the elders of Israel followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he spoke to the congregation, saying, I pray you, get away from the tents of these wicked men. And touch nothing of theirs lest you be destroyed in all their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they got away from the tent of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses said, By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, [and] that not from my own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If these men die the common death of all men, or if they are visited according to the examination of all men, the LORD has not sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if the LORD makes a new thing, and the earth opens her mouth and swallows them up with all that they have, and they go down alive into the pit, then you shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it happened, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, the ground under them split apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who [were] for Korah, and all [their] goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They and all that they had went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed upon them. And they perished from among the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And all Israel around them fled at their cry. For they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And there came out a fire from the LORD and burned up the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the fire-pans out of the burning, and scatter the fire yonder. For they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The fire-pans of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them into broad plates, a covering for the altar; for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are made holy. And they shall be a sign to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Eleazar the priest took the bronze fire-pans, the ones with which those who had been burned up had offered, and they were made into broad [plates], a covering of the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>a memorial to the sons of Israel, that no stranger not of the seed of Aaron may come near to offer incense before the LORD, so that he may not be as Korah and as his company-- as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron saying, You have killed the people of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it happened when the congregation was gathered together against Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation. And behold! The cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Get away from this congregation so that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a fire-pan, and put fire in it from the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation and make an atonement for them. For wrath has gone out from the LORD. The plague has begun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Aaron did as Moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation. And behold! The plague had begun among the people. And he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand, seven hundred, besides the ones who died about the matter of Korah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the plague was stayed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
