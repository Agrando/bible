And he shall kill her before his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he shall burn the heifer in his sight, her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung, he shall burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall take cedar-wood and hyssop and scarlet, and throw [it] into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water. And afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he who burns her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a man [that is] clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay up outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for a water of separation. It is a cleansing for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger that lives among them, for a statute forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean. But if he does not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. And that soul shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean. His uncleanness [is] still upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This [is] the law when a man dies in a tent. All that come into the tent, and all in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And every open vessel which has no covering bound upon it, it [is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And whoever touches one that is killed with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of cleansing for sin, and running water shall be put to it in a vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a clean person shall take hyssop and dip in the water, and sprinkle upon the tent and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one killed, or one dead, or a grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the clean [person] shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day. And on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water.

The water of separation has not been sprinkled upon him. He [is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be a perpetual law to them, that he who sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes. And he that touches the water of separation shall be unclean until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever the unclean touches shall be unclean.
