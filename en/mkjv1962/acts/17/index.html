And coming on the house of Jason, [they] sought to bring them out to the mob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brothers before the city judges, crying, These who have turned the world upside down have come here too,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>whom Jason has received. And these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And hearing these things, they troubled the crowd and the city judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And taking security from Jason and from the rest, they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. They, when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And these were more noble than those of Thessalonica, in that [they received] the Word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily [to see] if those things [were so].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore many of them believed, and quite a few of honorable Greek women and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the Word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And then immediately the brothers sent Paul away to go towards the sea, but both Silas and Timothy stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And those conducting Paul brought him to Athens. And receiving a command to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But awaiting them in Athens, Paul's spirit was pained within him, seeing the city full of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then indeed he addressed the Jews in the synagogue, and those worshiping, and daily in the market, to those happening to be [there].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And certain philosophers from the Epicureans and from the Stoics met him. And some said, What will this babbler say? And others said, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons (because he preached Jesus and the resurrection to them).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And taking hold of him, they led [him] to the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to know what [is] this new doctrine of which you speak?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you bring certain strange things to our ears, therefore we are minded to know what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(For all the Athenians and strangers who were [there] spent their time in nothing else except to tell or to hear something newer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And standing in [the] middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Men, Athenians, I see that you [are] fearful of gods in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For [as I] passed by and saw the things you worship, I also found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Not knowing then whom you worship, I make Him known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor is served with men's hands, [as though] He needed anything, [since] He gives life and breath and all things to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He has made all nations of men of one blood to dwell on all the face of the earth, ordaining fore-appointed seasons and boundaries of their dwelling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after Him and find Him, though indeed [He] is not far from each one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in Him we live and move and have our being, as also certain of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then being offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like gold or silver or stone, engraved by art and man's imagination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Truly, then, God overlooking the times of ignorance, now He strictly commands all men everywhere to repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because He has appointed a day in which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He appointed, having given proof to all [by] raising Him from [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And hearing [of] a resurrection of [the] dead, some indeed mocked; and others said, We will hear you again concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And so Paul departed from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But certain men joined themselves to him and believed; among whom [were] Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
