And Julius treated Paul courteously and gave [him] liberty to go to his friends to receive care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And setting sail from there, we sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And sailing over the sea against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, and he put us on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And sailing slowly many days and with difficulty, coming abreast of Cnidus; the wind not allowing us; we sailed close to Crete, across from Salmone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And coasting along with difficulty, we came to a place named Fair Havens, near which was a city, Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And much time having been used up, and the voyage already being dangerous, because the Fast was now already past, Paul warned [them] ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>saying, Men, I perceive that this voyage is about to be with much harm and loss, and not only much cargo and of the ship, but also of our souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the centurion was rather persuaded by the helmsman and the shipmaster, than by the things spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the port not being fit to winter in, the most of them advised to set sail from there, if by any means they might be able to get to Phoenix to winter; [which is] a port of Crete, looking toward [the] southwest and northwest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a south wind blowing softly, thinking to have obtained [their] purpose, lifting [anchor], they sailed along close beside Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after, a stormy wind called Euroclydon beat down [on] it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the ship being seized, and not being able to beat against the wind, giving way we were borne along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And running under an islet being called Clauda, we hardly were able to become masters of the boat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>which taking, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the sandbanks of Syrtis, lowering the tackle, so they were borne along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And being exceedingly storm-tossed with a tempest, they made a casting on the next [day] ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And on the third [day] we threw out the ship's tackle with our hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And neither sun nor stars appearing in many days, and no small tempest pressing hard, now all hope that we would be saved was taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But there being much fasting, then standing up in their midst, Paul said, O men, being obedient to me [you] ought not to have set sail from Crete, and to have come by this harm and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there will be no casting away of life among you, only of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For tonight an angel of God stood beside me, whose I am and whom I serve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Fear not, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And behold! God has given you all those who sail with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, men, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it will be so, according to the way it was told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But we must fall on a certain island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when [the] fourteenth night came, we being carried about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they drew near some country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And sounding they found it twenty fathoms; and moving a little further, and sounding again, they found [it] fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And fearing that we would fall on rocks, and casting four anchors out of [the] stern, they wished day to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and lowering the boat into the sea, pretending to be about to cast out anchors from [the] prow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat, and let her fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And until day was about to come, Paul begged all to take food, saying, This [is] the fourteenth day that you continued waiting without food, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore I beg you to take [some] food, for this is for your deliverance. For not a hair of your head shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And saying these things, and taking bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and breaking, he began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all becoming cheered, they also took food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And being filled [with] food, they lightened the ship, throwing the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when day came, they did not recognize the land. But they discovered a certain bay with a beach, into which they were minded, if they were able, to drive the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And casting off the anchors, they left [them] in the sea; at the same time they loosened the rudder bands and hoisted up the foresail to the wind and held to the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And coming on a place between two seas, they drove the vessel. And indeed the prow sticking fast, [it] remained unmovable. But the stern was broken with the violence of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the mind of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, kept them from [their] purpose and commanded those who could swim, to throw [themselves] overboard, to go out on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the rest [went], some on boards and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were saved on the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
