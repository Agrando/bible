And they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when they had commanded them to go aside out of the sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all those dwelling in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, so that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, [that] they speak to no man in this name from now on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right before God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way [as to] how they might punish them, because of the people. For all glorified God for that which was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man on whom this miracle of healing occurred was more than forty years [old].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being let go, they went to their own company and reported what the chief priests and elders had said [to them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having heard, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, You [are] the God who made the heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who by the mouth of Your servant David has said, Why did the nations rage and the people imagine vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For truly, against Your holy child Jesus, whom You have anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and [the] people of Israel, were gathered together</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>in order to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel determined before to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your Word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>by stretching forth of Your hand for healing, and miracles, and wonders may be done by the name of Your holy child Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken. And they were all filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul. And not one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own. But they had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power. And great grace was on them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For neither was anyone needy among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold [them] and brought the prices of the [things] that were sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they laid [them] down at the apostles' feet. And distribution was made to every man according as he had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being translated, The son of consolation), a Levite, a Cypriot by race,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>a field being his, selling [it], he bore the proceeds and placed [them] at the apostles' feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
