And behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, [the] son of a woman who was a Jewess and who believed. But [his] father [was] a Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>[He] was well reported of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Paul wanted him to go with him, and taking [him he] circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them the commandments to keep, the ones that were ordained by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then indeed the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And coming through the Phrygian and the Galatian region; and by the Holy Spirit being forbidden to speak the Word in Asia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>having come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia. But the Spirit did not allow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then passing by Mysia, they came down into Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A certain man of Macedonia stood, begging him, saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And after he saw the vision, we immediately tried to go into Macedonia, gathering that the Lord had called us in order to preach the gospel [to] them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then having set sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next [day] to Neapolis;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we continued spending time in that city some days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was usually made. And we sat down and spoke to the women who came together [there].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And a certain woman named Lydia heard us, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God; whose heart the Lord opened, so that she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when she was baptized, she and her household, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay. And she constrained us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as we went to prayer, it happened that a certain girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by divining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The same followed Paul and us and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who are announcing to us the way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she did this many days. But being distressed, and turning to the [demonic] spirit, Paul said, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! And it came out in that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain went out, having seized Paul and Silas, they dragged [them] to the market before the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And bringing them near to the judges, they said, These men, being Jews, are exceedingly troubling our city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the crowd rose up against them. And tearing off their clothes, the judges ordered [them] to be flogged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after laying on them many stripes, they threw [them] into prison, commanding the jailor to keep them safely;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who, having received such a command, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And toward midnight Paul and Silas prayed and praised God in a hymn. And the prisoners listened to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds were loosened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And being awakened, and seeing the doors of the prison being open, drawing a sword, the jailer was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then asking for a light he rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And leading them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved, and your household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And taking them in that hour of the night, he washed from [their] stripes. And he was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And bringing them up to the house, he set a table before [them] and rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And day coming, the judges sent the floggers, saying, Let those men go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the jailer spoke these words to Paul: The judges have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly, men who are Romans and uncondemned, they threw [us] into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! But coming themselves, let them bring us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the floggers reported these words to the judges. And hearing that they were Romans, they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And coming they begged [them]. And bringing [them] out, [they] asked [them] to depart out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And going out from the prison, [they] entered into [the house of] Lydia. And seeing the brothers, they comforted them and departed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
