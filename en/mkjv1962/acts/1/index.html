And you shall be witnesses to Me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to [the] end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And saying these things, [as] they watched, He was taken up. And a cloud received Him out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they were looking intently into the heaven, He having gone, even behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into the heaven? This same Jesus who is taken up from you into Heaven, will come in the way you have seen Him going into Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from [the] mount Of Olive Grove, which is a sabbath day's [journey] from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, where Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [the son] of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of James;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with [the] women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in those days Peter stood up in [the] midst of the disciples and said, ( the] number of names together [was] about a hundred and twenty,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men, brothers, this Scripture must have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who became guide to those who seized Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Indeed, then, this one purchased a field with the reward of unrighteousness. And falling headlong, he burst apart in [the] middle, and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem, so much so that that field is called in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is to say, Field of Blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in [the] Book of Psalms, Let his estate become forsaken, and he not be living in it. And, Let another take his overseership.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, it is right that one of these men who have companied with us all [the] time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the baptism of John to that same day that He was taken up from us, to become a witness with us of His resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed and said, You, Lord, knower of all hearts, show which one You chose from these two,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to take the share of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell, to go to [his] own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they gave forth their lots. And the lot fell upon Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
