I [am] pure from [it]. From now on I will go to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he departed from there and entered into [the] house of one named Justus, [one] worshiping God, whose house was next to the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house. And hearing this, many of the Corinthians believed and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord spoke to Paul in [the] night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and be not silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I am with you, and no one shall set on you to hurt you, for I have many people in this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Gallio [being] pro-consul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rushed against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, This one persuades men to worship God contrary to the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Paul being about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed then, it was anything wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, according to reason I would endure you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if it is a question of a word and names, and [of] your law, you look [to it]. For I do not wish to be a judge of such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them from the judgment seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat. And Gallio did not care for any of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul having remained many days more, taking leave of the brothers, he sailed from there into Syria. And Priscilla and Aquila were with him. And Paul had shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they asking [him] to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that is coming in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had landed at Caesarea and had gone up to greet the church, he went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had spent some time [there], he departed and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord. And [being] fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught the things of the Lord diligently, knowing only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla heard him, and they took him and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And intending to pass into Achaia, being encouraged, the brothers wrote to the disciples to welcome him; who, having arrived, very much helped those who had believed through grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he mightily confuted the Jews publicly, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
