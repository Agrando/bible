Hear my defense now to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And hearing that he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, they all the more kept silence. And he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am truly a man, a Jew born in Tarsus in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the exactness of the law of the fathers, being a zealous one of God, as you all are today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>[I] persecuted this Way as far as death, binding and delivering both men and women into prisons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>as also the high priest bears witness to me, and all the elderhood. And receiving letters from [them] to the brothers, I traveled into Damascus indeed to lead those being bound to Jerusalem, in order that they might be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it happened to me, traveling and drawing near to Damascus: suddenly, about midday, a great light out of the heaven shone around me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I answered, Who are you, lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid. But they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise and go into Damascus. And there it shall be told you all things which are appointed for you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I did not see, because of the glory of that light; being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, testified to by all the Jews who lived [there] ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>coming to me and standing by, said to me, Brother Saul, look up! And the same hour I looked up on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you to know His will and to see the Just One, and to hear a voice out of His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you shall be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now what do you intend? Arise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened to me, I returning to Jerusalem and praying in the temple, I became in an ecstasy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I saw Him say to me, Hurry and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating those who believed on You throughout the synagogues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was poured out, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and holding the garments of those who killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they listened to him until this word, and [then] they lifted up their voice, saying, Take such a one from the earth! For it is not fitting that he should live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as they shouted and tore [their] garments, and threw dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying for him to be examined by scourging, so that he might know why they cried out so against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as they stretched him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And hearing, coming near the centurion reported to the chiliarch, saying, Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And coming up the chiliarch said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And He said, Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the chiliarch answered, With a great sum I bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was even born [free].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then immediately, those being about to examine him stood away from him. And the chiliarch also was afraid, fully knowing that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>On the next day, he desiring to know with certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from [his] bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to appear. And bringing Paul down, [he] set [him among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
