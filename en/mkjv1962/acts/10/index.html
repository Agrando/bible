And he said to him, Your prayers and your merciful deeds have come up for a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now send men to Joppa and call for Simon, whose last name is Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is staying with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by [the] seaside. He will tell you what you must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from those who waited on him continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And explaining all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On the next day, as these went on [the] road, and drawing near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about [the] sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he became very hungry and desired to eat. But while they made ready, an ecstasy fell on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel like a sheet coming down to him, being bound at the four corners and let down to the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in which were all the four-footed animals of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds of the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a voice came to him, saying, Rise, Peter! Kill and eat!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the voice [spoke] to him again the second [time], What God has made clean, you do not call common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This happened three [times], and the vessel was received up again into the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And while Peter doubted within himself what the vision which he had seen might be, even behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had asked for Simon's house and stood on the porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called and asked if Simon whose last name is Peter was staying there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And [while] Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are looking for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore arise and go down and go with them without doubting, for I have sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And going down to the men, those sent to him from Cornelius, Peter said, Behold, I am [the one] you are seeking. For what reason have you come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man and [one] who fears God, and one of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear words from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he called them in and lodged [them]. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brothers from Joppa went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at [his] feet [and] worshiped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up! I also am a man myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man, a Jew to keep company with or to come near to one of another nation. But God has shown me not to call any man common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I came without complaint, being sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour. And at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your merciful deeds have been remembered before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore send to Joppa and call here Simon whose last name is Peter, he is staying in [the] house of Simon, a tanner by the seaside; who, when he comes, shall speak to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore I immediately sent to you, and you have done well [to] come. Now therefore we are all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded you by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Peter opened [his] mouth and said, Truly I see that God is no respecter of persons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but in every nation he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You know the word which [God] sent to the sons of Israel, preaching the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all!);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>that word which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with [the] Holy Spirit and with power, and He went about doing good, and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed [Him] and hanged [Him] on a tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but God raised Him up the third day and showed Him openly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses hand-picked before by God, [even] to us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained of God [to be] the Judge of [the] living and [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>All the prophets give witness to Him, [that] through His name whoever believes in Him [shall] receive remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those hearing the Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And those of the circumcision, who believed (as many as came with Peter), were astonished because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the nations also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Can anyone forbid water that these, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we, should not be baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they begged him to stay certain days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
