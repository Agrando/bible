And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in those days I will pour out My Spirit upon My slaves and My slave women, and they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give wonders in the heaven above, and miracles on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before that great and glorious Day of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be [that] everyone who shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Men, Israelites, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by powerful works, and wonders and miracles, which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>this One given [to you] by the before-determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, [you] have taken and by lawless hands, crucifying [Him], you put Him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David speaks concerning Him, I foresaw the Lord always before me, because He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad; and also My flesh shall rest in hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because You will not leave My soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You revealed to Me the ways of life. You will fill Me with joy with Your countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Men, brothers, it is permitted to say to you with plainness as to the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of [the] fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit upon his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>seeing this beforehand, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor would His flesh see corruption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>God raised up this Jesus, of which we all are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore being exalted to the right of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this which you now see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David has not ascended into the heavens, but he says himself, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right [hand]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I place Your enemies [as] a footstool to Your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God made this same Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And hearing [this], they were stabbed in the heart, and said to Peter and to the other apostles, Men, brothers, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ to remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as [the] Lord our God shall call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words he earnestly testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day there were added about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they were continuing steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, and in fellowship and in the breaking of the loaves, and in prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear came on every soul. And many wonders and miracles took place through the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all who believed were together and had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And continuing with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they shared food with gladness and simplicity of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
