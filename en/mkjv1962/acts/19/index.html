And finding certain disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>he said to them, Have you received [the] Holy Spirit since you believed? And they said to him, We did not so much as hear whether [the] Holy Spirit is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to them, Then to what were you baptized? And they said, To John's baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Paul said, John truly baptized [with] the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe into Him coming after him, that is, into Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And hearing, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And as Paul laid [his] hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all of the men were about twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And going into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some were hardened and did not believe, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this happened over two years, so that all those living in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God did works of power through the hands of Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin being brought onto the sick, the diseases were released, and the evil spirits went out of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And certain from the strolling Jews, exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having evil spirits, saying, We adjure you [by] Jesus whom Paul preaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But answering the evil spirit said, Jesus I know, and I comprehend Paul, but who are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man in whom the evil spirit resided leaped on them, and overcoming them he was strong against them, so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks who lived at Ephesus, and fear fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And many who believed came and confessed and showed their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also many of those practicing the curious arts, bringing together the books, burned [them] before all. And they counted the prices of them and found [it to be] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the Word of God grew mightily and prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After these things were ended, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have come there, I must also see Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And sending into Macedonia two who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he stayed in Asia for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And about that time there was not a little a stir about the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For a certain silversmith named Demetrius was making silver temples of Artemis, providing not a little trade [for] the craftsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And assembling the workmen about such things, he said, Men, you know that from this trade is our wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost all Asia, this Paul having persuaded, he has perverted a huge crowd, saying that those which are made with hands are no gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And not only is this dangerous to us, our share coming into dispute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted for nothing, and her magnificence is also about to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And hearing, and becoming full of anger, they cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of [the] Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And all the city was filled with confusion. And they rushed with one accord to the theater, keeping a firm grip on Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Paul intending to go in to the mob, the disciples did not allow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And some of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, begging [him] not to give himself into the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then indeed others cried out, some other things; for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they dragged Alexander forward out of the crowd, the Jews thrusting him forward. And waving [his] hand Alexander desired to defend himself to the mob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for two hours' [time], Great [is] Artemis of [the] Ephesians!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And quieting the crowd, the town clerk said, Men, Ephesians! What one of you does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Artemis, and of That Fallen from the Sky?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Since these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of churches nor blasphemers of your goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore if Demetrius and those craftsmen with him truly have a matter against anyone, the court days are [kept], and there are proconsuls. Let them plead against one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you ask anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we are in danger to be accused of revolt concerning today; there being no cause by which we may give an account of this crowding together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
