And after it was sold, was it [not] in your own authority? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And hearing these words, Ananias fell down [and] expired. And great fear came on all those who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the younger ones arose, wound him up, and carrying [him] out, [they] buried [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was about the space of three hours afterward, when his wife (not knowing what was done) came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land [for] so much? And she said, Yes, [for] so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said to her, How [is it] that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of [the] Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband [are] at the door and they will carry you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then at once she fell down at his feet and expired. And the younger ones found her dead, and, carrying [her] out, buried her beside her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear came on all the church and on as many as heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And many miracles and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's Porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And of the rest no one dared to join himself to them, but the people magnified them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and more believing ones were added to [the] Lord, multitudes both of men and women;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So as to carry out the sick into the streets and place [them] on cots and mattresses, so that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And also a multitude came [from] the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick ones, and those being tormented by unclean spirits, who were all healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And rising up, the high priest, and all those who were with him (which is the [sect] of the Sadducees) were filled with anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the public custody.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the angel of [the] Lord opened the prison doors by night and brought them out, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go! Stand and speak all the words of this Life to the people in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And hearing, they went into the temple about dawn, and taught. But the high priest came, and those with him. And they called the sanhedrin together, and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But having come near, the officers did not find them in the prison. And returning, reported,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>saying, We indeed found the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside in front of the doors. But having opened it, we found no one inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the high priest and the temple commander and the chief priests heard these things, they were bewildered about them, what this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But one came, reporting to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the commander went with the officers [and] brought them, not with force, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And bringing them, they stood in the sanhedrin. And the high priest asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, Did we not strictly command you [that] you not teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Peter and the apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed and hanged on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>This One God [has] exalted [to be] a Ruler and Savior to His right [hand] in order to give repentance and remission of sins to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are His witnesses of these things. And [so] also [is] the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But those hearing were cut [to the heart], and they took counsel to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then there stood up one in the sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law honored among all the people. And he commanded the apostles to be put outside a little space.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do [regarding] these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For before these days Theudas rose up, boasting himself to be somebody; a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him; who was slain. And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered and brought to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this one, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the Registration, and drew away considerable people after him. Yet that one perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I say to you, withdraw from these men and let them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they obeyed him. And calling the apostles, beating [them], they commanded not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then indeed they departed from [the] presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be shamed for His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And every day in the temple, and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching the gospel: Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
