And in an ecstasy I saw a vision, a certain vessel like a sheet coming down, let down from the sky by four corners. And it came even to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When I had fastened my eyes on [it], I looked and saw four-footed animals of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and birds of the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter! Kill and eat!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But I said, Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the voice answered me again from the heaven, What God has made clean, you do not call common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this was done three [times], and all were drawn up again into the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Spirit told me to go with them, not discriminating. And these six brothers [went] with me, and we entered the man's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he declared to us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa and call for Simon whose last name is Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who will tell you words by which you and all your house shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at [the] beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the Word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If God gave to them the same gift as to us, they] having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to prevent God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard these things, they were silent and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted repentance to life to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, indeed, they who were scattered abroad by the persecution that rose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the Word to no one except the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene; who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And [the] hand of [the] Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem. And they sent out Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who was glad when he had come and had seen the grace of God. And he exhorted all with purpose of heart to remain near to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man and full of [the] Holy Spirit and faith. And many people were added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas went out to Tarsus to seek Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And finding him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened to them a whole year they] were assembled in the church. And they] taught a considerable crowd. And the disciples were first called Christian in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in these days prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of them named Agabus stood up and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine over the world (which also happened in the [days] of Claudius Caesar).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the disciples, as any were prospered, determined each of them to send for ministry to those brothers who lived in Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>which they also did, sending to the elders by [the] hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
