And he continued his speech until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were many lights in the upper room where they were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a certain young man named Eutychus [was] sitting on the window sill, Paul reasoning for a longer time, being overborne by sleep, he fell down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Paul went down and fell on him, and embracing [him] said, Do not be terrified, for his soul is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And going up, and breaking bread, and tasting, and conversing over a long [time], until daybreak, he went out thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And going ahead onto the ship, we sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And we sailed from there and came the next [day] across from Chios. And the next [day] we arrived at Samos, and we stayed at Trogyllium. And the next [day] we came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not lose time in Asia; for, if it were possible for him, he hastened to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they had come to him, he said to them, You know how I was with you at all times, from [the] first day I arrived in Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and many tears and temptations happening to me through the plots of the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[and] how I kept back nothing that was profitable, but have shown you and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, behold, I am going bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall happen to me there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus [Christ], to testify fully the gospel of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, behold, I know that you all will see my face no more, among whom I went proclaiming the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I testify to you on this day that I [am] pure from the blood of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to feed the church of God which He has purchased with [His] own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Also men shall arise from your own selves, speaking perverse things in order to draw disciples away after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watch and remember that [for the time] of three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yea, you yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to those who were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have shown you all things, that working in this way we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And saying these things, kneeling, he prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there was much weeping of all, and falling on the neck of Paul, they ardently kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>grieving most of all over the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they went with him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
