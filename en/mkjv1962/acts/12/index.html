(And they were days of Unleavened [Bread].)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And capturing [him], he put [him] in prison, and delivered [him] to four sets of four soldiers to keep him; intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then, indeed, Peter was kept in prison. But earnest prayer was made to God for him by the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Herod was about to bring him out, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Also guards were keeping the prison before the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And behold! An angel of [the] Lord stood by, and a light shone in the building. And striking Peter's side, he raised him up, saying, Rise up quickly! And his chains fell off his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the angel said to him, Gird yourself and put on your sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Throw your robe around you and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he went out and followed him. And he did not know that this happening through the angel was true, but thought he saw a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they were past the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord. And they went out and passed on through one street. And immediately the angel departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And having come to himself, Peter said, Now I know surely that [the] Lord has sent His angel and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and [from] all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thinking [about it], he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose last name was Mark; where many had gathered together to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as Peter knocked [at] the door of the porch, a girl named Rhoda came to listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when she knew Peter's voice, she did not open the porch because of gladness, but running in she reported Peter [was] standing before the porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they said to her, You are mad. But she kept on saying that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened and saw him, they were amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, waving to them with his hand to be quiet, he declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go tell these things to James and to the brothers. And he departed and went into another place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And day coming, there was not a little stir among the soldiers, saying, What, then, became of Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And searching for him, and not finding [him], examining the guards, Herod commanded them to be led away to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Herod was in bitter hostility with the men of Tyre and Sidon. But they came to him with one accord and, having made Blastus (who had charge of the king's bedroom) their friend, desired peace, because their country was fed by the king's [country].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And on a certain day, Herod sat on his throne, dressed in royal clothing, and made a speech to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people gave a shout, [saying, It is] the voice of a god and not of a man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And immediately the angel of [the] Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory. And he was eaten by worms and gave up the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the Word of God grew and increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled the ministry, having taken with [them] John, whose last name was Mark.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
