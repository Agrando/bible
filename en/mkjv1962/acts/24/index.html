By examining him, you yourself may know about all these things of which we accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the governor motioning to him to speak, Paul answered; Understanding you as being a judge of this nation many years, I cheerfully defend myself [as to] the things concerning myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You can know that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, nor making a gathering of a crowd; not even in the synagogues, nor throughout the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I confess this to you, that after the Way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of [the] dead, both of the just and unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in this I exercise myself, always to have a blameless conscience toward God and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Among which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor with tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These ought to be present before you and to accuse me, if they have anything against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Or else let these themselves say if they have found anything unjust in me while I stood before the sanhedrin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>unless it may be for this one voice that I cried out standing among them, that concerning a resurrection of [the] dead I am being judged by you today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having heard these things, Felix put them off, knowing more accurately of the Way, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch has come down, I will examine the things concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let [him] have liberty, and not to forbid anyone of his own to minister or come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the Judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, Go for this time, but taking time later, I will call for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He also hoped that silver would be given him by Paul, that he might free him. Therefore [he] also frequently sent for him [and] talked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But after two years Felix welcomed a successor, Porcius Festus. And wishing to show a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
