For they kindled a fire and welcomed all of us, because of the rain coming on, and because of the cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laying [them] on the fire, a viper came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, being saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then indeed he shook off the creature into the fire, suffering no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But they expected him to be about to become inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly, But over much [time] expecting and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the [quarters] about that place were lands to the chief of the island, whose name was Publius. Welcoming us, [he] lodged us courteously three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened the father of Publius was lying down, suffering fevers and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and praying and laying on his hands, he healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then this taking place, the rest who were having infirmities in the island also came, and were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[They] also honored us with many honors. And on [our] setting sail, they laid on the things of [our] needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after three months we sailed in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian with an ensign, The Twin Brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Going around from there we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind coming on, we came to Puteoli on the second,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>where finding brothers, we were asked to stay seven days. And so we went toward Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the brothers from there hearing of us, [they] came to meet us as far as [the] market-place of Appius, and Three Taverns. Seeing them, thanking God, Paul took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when we came into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the camp commander. But Paul was allowed to dwell by himself, with a soldier guarding him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And after three days it happened that Paul called together those being chief of the Jews. And they coming together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I did nothing against the people or customs of our fathers. I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, examining me, were of a mind to let [me] go because there was no cause of death in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the Jews speaking against [it], I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not as having anything to accuse my nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For this cause, then, I called for you, to see and to speak with [you]. For I have this chain around me for the hope of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came declared or spoke anything evil of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we think [it] right to hear from you what you think. For truly as concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they having appointed him a day, many came to him in [his] lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them the things concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some indeed believed the things that were said, others did not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And disagreeing with one another, they were let go, Paul saying one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>saying, Go to this people and say: Hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see and not perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the heart of this people was fattened, and they have heard with their ears dully; and they closed their eyes; lest at any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore be it known to you that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and they will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he having said these words, the Jews departed, having much discussion amongst themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Paul remained two years in his own hired house. And he welcomed all who came in to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching those things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom, [and] without hindrance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
