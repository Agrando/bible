And they caused great joy to all the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And arriving in Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and [by] the apostles and elders. And [they] declared all things that God had done with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But some of those from the sect of the Pharisees, having believed, rose up, saying, It was necessary to circumcise them and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the apostles and elders were assembled to see about this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after much disputing, Peter rose up and said to them, Men, brothers, you recognize that from ancient days God chose among us [that] through my mouth the nations [should] hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit even as to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore why do you tempt God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples, a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But we believe that through the grace of [the] Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, according to which manner they also believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders God had worked among the nations through them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even as Simon has declared [how] God [at] the first visited the nations to take out of them a people for His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the words of the prophets agree to this; as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After this I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David [which] has fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so those men who are left might seek after the Lord, and all the nations on whom My name has been called, says the Lord, who does all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All His works are known to God from eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore my judgment is that we do not trouble those who have turned to God from among the nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but that we write to them that they should abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] fornication, and [from] things strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses from ages past has those in every city proclaiming him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas, whose last name was Barsabas; and Silas, chief men among the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they wrote these things by their hand: The apostles and elders and brothers [send] greeting to the brothers, from [the] nations in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because we have heard that certain ones who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, Be circumcised and keep the law! (to whom we gave no such command);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it seemed [good] to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also announce [to you] the same things by word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed [good] to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you abstain from meats offered to idols, and [from] blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which, if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Be prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then indeed they being let go, they came to Antioch. And gathering the multitude, [they] delivered the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had read [it], they rejoiced at the comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words and confirmed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And remaining for a time, they were let go in peace from the brothers to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But it pleased Silas to remain there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Also Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the gospel, the Word of the Lord, with many others also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And some days afterward, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have announced the Word of the Lord, to see] how they are holding to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Barnabas determined to take with [them] John, he being called Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul thought it well not to take that one with [them], he having withdrawn from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then there was sharp feeling, so as to separate them from each other. And taking Mark, Barnabas sailed to Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But choosing Silas, Paul went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>passing through Syria and Cilicia, making the churches strong.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
