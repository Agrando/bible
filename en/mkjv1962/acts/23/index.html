For do you sit judging me according to the Law, and against law command me to be stricken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they who stood by him said, Do you revile God's high priest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Paul saw that the one part were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, he cried out in the sanhedrin, Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there arose a great cry. And the scribes [who were] on the Pharisees' side arose and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And dissension arising, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force, and to bring [him] into the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer, Paul, for as you have testified of Me in Jerusalem, so you also must bear witness at Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when [it] became day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they who made this conspiracy were more than forty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they came to the chief priests and elders and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore you, with the sanhedrin, inform the chiliarch that he bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you would inquire something more perfectly regarding him. And we are ready to put him to death before he comes near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And hearing of the ambush, Paul's sister's son, having come near, and entering into the fortress, he reported to Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And calling one of the centurions, Paul said, Bring this young man to the chiliarch, for he has a certain thing to tell him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he took him and brought [him] to the chiliarch and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And laying hold of his hand, and drawing aside privately, the chiliarch asked [him], What is [it] that you have to tell me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they would inquire something more exactly about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But do not yield to them, for there are more than forty men of them lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, looking for a promise from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the chiliarch sent away the young man commanding, Tell no one that you have shown these things to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he called two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And provide animals, so that they may set Paul on them and bring [him] to Felix the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he wrote a letter in this way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man was taken by the Jews and would have been killed by them. Then I came with an army and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And being minded to know the charge for which they accused him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>whom I found be accused of questions of their law, and having no charge worthy of death or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it being revealed to me that a plot against the man was about to be [executed] by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers also to say before you what [they had] against him. Farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then, indeed, taking up Paul, as it was commanded them, the soldiers brought [him] by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they had come to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, [they] presented Paul before him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that [he was] from Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>he said, I will hear you when your accusers have also come. And [he] commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
