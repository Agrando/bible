And in that day there was a great persecution on the church at Jerusalem, and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And devout men buried Stephen and made a great mourning over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul ravaged the church, entering into every house. And dragging men and women, he delivered [them] up to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then, indeed, the ones who had been scattered passed through, preaching the gospel, the Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the many miracles which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For out of those having unclean spirits, many came out, crying with loud voice. And many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a certain man called Simon had long been conjuring in the city, and amazing the nation of Samaria, claiming himself to be some great one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All gave heed to [him], from the least to the greatest, saying, This one is the great power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they were paying attention to him, because for a long time he had amazed them [with] conjuring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip preaching the gospel, the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Simon himself believed also, and being baptized, he continued with Philip. And seeing miracles and mighty works happening, he was amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the apostles in Jerusalem hearing that Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For as yet He had not fallen on any of them, they were baptized only in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid [their] hands on them, and they received [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, Give me this power also, that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, May your silver perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that you are in [the] gall of bitterness and [in] the bond of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And answering Simon said, You pray to the Lord for me that none of these things which you have spoken may come on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then, indeed, having earnestly testified and having spoken the Word of the Lord also having preached the gospel [to] many villages of the Samaritans, they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the angel of [the] Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south, on the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is a deserted [place].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem to worship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>was returning. And sitting in his chariot he read Isaiah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join yourself to this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip ran there to [him] and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you indeed understand what you are reading?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How can I unless some man should guide me? And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the content of the Scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so He opened not His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In His humiliation His judgment was taken away, and who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I beg you, of whom does the prophet speak this? Of himself or of some other man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture and preached the gospel of Jesus to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they passed along the way, they came on some water. And the eunuch said, See, here is water, what hinders me [from] being baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, it is lawful. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch. And he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they had come up out of the water, [the] Spirit of [the] Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
