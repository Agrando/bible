And part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when there was an assault made by both the nations and the Jews, with their rulers, in order to insult and to stone them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>they were aware of [it] and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the country around them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there they were preaching the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a certain man was sitting in Lystra, without strength in the feet, being lame from his mother's womb, who never had walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This one heard Paul speaking; [and Paul], looking intently at him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>said with a loud voice, Stand up on your feet! And he leaped and walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And seeing what Paul did, the crowd lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have come down to us, becoming like men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest of Jupiter, being before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, wishing to sacrifice with the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But hearing [this], the apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, Men, why do you do these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preaching the gospel to you to turn [you] from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who in past generations allowed all nations to walk in their [own] ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving rain and fruitful season to us from heaven, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And saying these things, they scarcely stopped the people from sacrificing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, who, having persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, they drew [him] out of the city, supposing him to have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the disciples surrounding him, he rose up and came into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And preaching the gospel to that city, and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>confirming the souls of the disciples, calling on them to continue in the faith and that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having hand-picked elders for them in every church, and had prayed with fastings, they commended them to the Lord into whom they believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And speaking the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And having arrived, and gathering the church they related all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they stayed there not a little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
