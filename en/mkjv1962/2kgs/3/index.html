He did not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with the wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at the same time and numbered all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up. I [am] as you  are], my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king of Israel and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom went. And they went around behind for seven days' journey. And there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may ask of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. And the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Elisha said, [As] the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely if it were not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you nor see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now bring me a minstrel. And it happened when the minstrel played, the hand of the LORD came on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, So says the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For so says the LORD, You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain. Still that valley shall be filled [with] water, so that you may drink, both you and your cattle, and your animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this is a light thing in the sight of the LORD. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city. And you shall cut down every good tree and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece [of land] with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it happened in the morning when the food offering was offered, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all Moab had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on [armor], and upward, and stood in the border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side red [like] blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they said, This [is] blood. The kings are surely slain, and they have stricken one another. And now, Moab, to the spoil!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they came to the camp of Israel, and the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them. But they [entered it and] struck Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they beat down the cities, and each man cast his stone on every good piece [of land], and filled it. And they stopped all the wells of water, and cut down all the good trees. Only in Kir-haraseth did they leave the stones of it. But the slingers surrounded it and struck it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, in order to break through to the king of Edom. And they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he took his oldest son, who would have reigned in his place, and offered him [for] a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great anger against Israel. And they left him, and returned to the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
