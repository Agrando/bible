And let each man take a beam from there. And let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And one said, Be content, please, and go with your servants. And he answered them, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he went with them. And they came to Jordan, and they cut down trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened as one was felling a log, the axe-head fell into the water. And he cried and said, Alas, master! For it was borrowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick and threw [it] in there. And the iron swam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, take [it] up to you. And he put out his hand and took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place [shall be] my camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you do not pass such a place, for the Syrians have come down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel sent to the place of which the man of God told him and warned him, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the heart of the king of Syria was enraged for this thing. And he called his servants and said to them, Will you not show me which of us [is] for the king of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king, but Elisha the prophet, who [is] in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, Go and spy where he [is], so that I may send and bring him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, [he is] in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he sent there horses and chariots and a great army. And they came by night and surrounded the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the servant of the man of God arose early and went out. And, behold, an army surrounded the city, and horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he answered, Do not fear, for those with us [are] more than those with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Elisha prayed and said, I pray You, LORD, open his eyes so that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain [was] full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they came down to it, and Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, I pray You, strike this people with blindness. And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Elisha said to them, This [is] not the way, nor [is] this the city. Follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. But he led them to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it happened when they came into Samaria, Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these [men] so that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw. And behold, [they were] in the middle of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he saw them, the king of Israel said to Elisha, My father, shall I strike [them]? Shall I strike [them] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he answered, You shall not strike [them]. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them so that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he prepared a great feast for them. And when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it happened after this Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his army and went up and lay siege to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there was a great famine in Samaria. And, behold, they besieged it until an ass's head was [sold] for eighty [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five silver pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, if the LORD does not help you, from where shall I help you? Out of the barn-floor, or out of the winepress?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the king said to her, What [ails] you? And she said, This woman said to me, Give your son so that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And we boiled my son and ate him. And I said to her on the other day, Give your son so that we may eat him. And she has hidden her son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it happened when the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. And he passed by on the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, [he had] sackcloth inside on his flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, May God do so, and more also, to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him. And he sent a man from before him. [But] before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold him fast at the door. [Is] not the sound of his master's feet behind him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>While he still talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. And he said, Behold, this evil [is] from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
