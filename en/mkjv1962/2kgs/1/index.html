And [he] sent messengers and said to them, Go, ask of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise! Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, [Is it] not because no God is in Israel [that] you go to ask of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And therefore so says the LORD, You shall not come from that bed on which you have gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the messengers turned back to him. And he said, Why have you now turned back?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they said to him, A man came up to meet us and said to us, Go, turn again to the king who sent you, and say to him, So says the LORD, [Is it] not because no God [is] in Israel [that you go to ask of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore, you shall not come down from that bed on which you have gone up, but shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to them, What kind of man [was he] who came up to meet you and told you these words?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they answered him, [He was] a hairy man and was bound with a girdle of leather around his loins. And he said, He [is] Elijah the Tishbite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he sent to him a commander of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him. And, behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him, Man of God! The king has said, Come down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elijah answered and said to the commander of fifty, If I [am] a man of God, then let fire come down from the heavens and burn up you and your fifty. And there came down fire from the heavens and burned up him and his fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he turned and he sent to him another commander of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, Man of God! So says the king, Come down quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elijah answered and said to him, If I [am] a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and burn up you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens and burned up him and his fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he turned and sent again a third commander of fifty and his fifty. And the third commander of fifty came up and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, Man of God, Please let my life and the life of these fifty, your servants, be precious in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, fire has come down from the heavens and burned up the two commanders of the former fifties with their fifties. And now let my life be precious in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him. And he arose and went down with him to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And [he] said to him, So says the LORD, Because you have sent messengers to ask of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, [Is it] not because no God [is] in Israel to seek His word? Therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you have gone up, but shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his place, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, [are] they not written in the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
