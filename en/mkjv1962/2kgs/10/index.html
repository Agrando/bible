And Jehu wrote letters and sent to Samaria to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to the supporters of Ahab, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master's sons [are] with you, and chariots and horses are] with you, also a fortified city and armor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>even look for the best and fittest of your master's sons, and set [him] on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they were exceedingly afraid and said, Behold, two kings did not stand before him; how then shall we stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he who [was] over the house, and he over the city, the elders also, and the guardians, sent to Jehu saying, We [are] your servants and will do all that you shall say to us; we will not make any king. Do what is good in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you [are] mine, and will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men, your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by this time tomorrow. And the king's sons, seventy persons, [were] with the great men of the city who brought them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it happened when the letter came to them, they took the king's sons and killed them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets and sent to him in Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a messenger came and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it happened in the morning, he went out and stood, and said to all the people, You [are] righteous. Behold, I plotted against my master and killed him. But who killed all these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now know that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab. For the LORD has done that which He spoke by His servant Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehu killed all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. He [was] at the shepherds' shearing-house in the way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who [are] you? And they answered, The brothers of Ahaziah. And we are going down to greet the king's sons and the queen's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, Take them alive! And they took them alive and killed them at the pit of the shearing-house, forty-two men. And he left not a man of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he left there and found Jehonadab the son of Rechab [coming] to meet him. And [he] greeted him and said to him, [Is] your heart right, as my heart [is] with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it is, give your hand. And he gave his hand. And he took him up to him into the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And [he] said, Come with me and see my zeal for Jehovah. And they made him ride in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came to Samaria, and killed all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of Jehovah which he spoke to Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little, [but] Jehu shall serve him much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. Let no one be lacking. For I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever shall be lacking, he shall not live. But Jehu was acting with cunning, to the end that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehu said, Call a solemn feast for Baal. And they called [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehu sent through all Israel. And all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they came into the house of Baal. And the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to him who [was] over the robe-room, Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal. And he brought [them] out for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal. And he said to the servants of Baal, Search and look, that there [may] not [be] here with you any of the servants of the LORD, but only the servants of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. And Jehu had appointed eighty men outside, and said, [If] any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes, his life shall be for the life of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it happened when he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the commanders, Go in. Kill them! Do not let any come out! And they struck them with the edge of the sword. And the guard and the commanders threw [them] out. And they went to the city, to the house of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal and burned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And [they] broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal and made it a sewer-house until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Only, Jehu did not depart [from] the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, going after them, the golden calves in Bethel and in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the LORD said to him, Jehu, because you have done well in doing the right in My eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that [was] in My heart, your sons of the fourth  generation] shall sit on the throne of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Jehu did not care to walk in the law of Jehovah God of Israel with all his heart, for he did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short. And Hazael struck them in all the border of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>from Jordan toward the rising of the sun, all the land of Gilead, the men of Gad and of Reuben and of Manasseh, from Aroer, by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did, and all his might, [are] they not written in the Book of the Matter of the Days of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehu slept with his fathers. And they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the days that Jehu reigned over Israel and Samaria [were] twenty-eight years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
