So says the LORD, Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour [will be] sold at a shekel, and two measures of barley at a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the third officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, [if] the LORD would make windows in heaven, then this thing might be. And he said, Behold, you shall see with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And four men, lepers, were at the gate entrance. And they said to one another, Why do we sit here until we die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine [is] in the city, and we shall die there. And if we still sit here, we also shall die. And now come and let us fall to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we shall live. And if they kill us, we shall only die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they rose up in the twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. And when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, no man [was] there!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the LORD had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses, the noise of a great army. And they said to one another, Lo, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians against us, to come on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses, the camp, as it [was], and fled for their life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried silver and gold and clothing from there, and went and hid [it]. And they came again and entered into another tent and carried from there, and went and hid [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to one another, We are not doing right. This day [is] a day of good news, and we hold our peace. If we stay until the morning light, some punishment will come on us. And now come, so that we may go and tell the king's household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they came and called to the porter of the city. And they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, no man [was] there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they [were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he called the porters. And they told [it] to the king's house inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king arose in the night and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we [are] hungry, and they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive and get into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one of his servants answered and said, Please let [some] take five of the horses which remain, which are left in the city; behold, they [are] like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they [are] even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed. And we will send and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they took two chariots [with] horses. And the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they went after them to Jordan. And, lo, all the way [was] full of clothing and vessels which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. And it happened, a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king appointed the third officer over the gate, [the one] on whose hand he had leaned. And the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it happened according to the saying of the man of God to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel: [This] shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the third officer answered the man of God and said, Behold, [if] the LORD should make windows in heaven, then such a thing might be. And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it happened to him, for the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
