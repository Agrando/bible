And Elisha said, [As] the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the sons of the prophets at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from your head today? And he said, Yes, I know. Keep silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, please stay here. For the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, [As] the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of the prophets at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from your head today? And he answered, Yes, I know. Keep silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elijah said to him, Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, [As] the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And the two of them went on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went on and stood afar off across [from them]. And both of them stood by the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elijah took his mantle and rolled [it] up, and struck the waters. And they were divided here and there, so that both of them crossed over on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it happened when they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha. Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken away from you. And Elisha said, please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, You have asked a hard thing, [but] if you see me taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened as they went on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire [came], and they separated between them both. And Elijah went up in a tempest into Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elisha saw, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his clothes and tore them in two pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He also took up the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where [is] Jehovah God of Elijah, even He? And he also hit the waters, and they parted here and there. And Elisha went over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of the prophets across in Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha! And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And [they] said to him, Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master, lest the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send. And they sent fifty men. And they looked for three days, but did not find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they returned to him, And he was staying in Jericho. And he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, please, the location of this city [is] pleasant, as my lord sees. But the waters [are] bad, and the ground [is] barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Bring me a new jar and put salt in it. And they brought to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he went forth to the spring of the waters and threw the salt in there, and said, So says the LORD, I have healed these waters. There shall not be any more death or barrenness from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from there to Bethel. And he was going up in the highway. And little boys came out from the city and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned behind him and saw them, and declared them vile in the name of the LORD. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two boys of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
