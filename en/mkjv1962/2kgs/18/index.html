His mother's name [was] Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he did the right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that David his father did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent which Moses had made; for until those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it. And he called it Nehushtan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He trusted in Jehovah God of Israel, and after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he clung to Jehovah. He did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah was with him. He was blessed wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and did not serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the Watch Tower to the fortified city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it happened in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And at the end of three years they took it, in the sixth year of Hezekiah, it [was] the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king of Assyria carried away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor [by] the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant, [and] all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not listen to them, nor do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; turn back from me. Whatever you put on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah gave him all the silver which was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid. And he gave them to the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan, and the chief of the eunuchs, and the chief of the cupbearers from Lachish, to king Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the Fuller's Field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called to the king. And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who [was] over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, went out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief of the cupbearers said to them, Speak now to Hezekiah, So says the great king, the king of Assyria, What hope [is] this in which you trust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do you say that a mere word of the lips [is] wisdom and strength for the war? Now on whom do you trust that you rebel against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God, is He not the one whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now, please give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver two thousand horses to you if you are able to set riders on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And how will you turn away the face of one commander of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have I now come up against this place to destroy it without Jehovah? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah said to the chief of the cupbearers, Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand. And do not talk with us in Jewish, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the chief of the cupbearers said to them, Has my master sent me to your master and to you, to speak these words, [and] not to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the chief of the cupbearers stood and cried with a loud voice in Jewish, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. For he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And do not let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do not listen to Hezekiah. For so says the king of Assyria, Make with me a blessing, and come out to me, and you each shall eat of his vine, and each of his fig tree, and you each shall drink of the waters of his own cistern,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and of honey, and live, and not die. And do not listen to Hezekiah when he deceives you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Has any of the gods of the nations at all delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Where [are] the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? Where [are] the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the people kept silent and did not answer him a word. For the king's command was, saying, Do not answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn. And they told him the words of the chief of the cupbearers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
