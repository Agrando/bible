For the LORD has called for a famine. And it shall also come on the land seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God. And she went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it happened at the end of seven years, the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines. And she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Please tell me all the great things which Elisha has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for the house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O, king, this [is] the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain eunuch saying, Restore all that [was] hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day when she left the land, even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Elisha came to Damascus. And Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick. And they told him, saying, The man of God has come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand and go to meet the man of God, and ask of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your servant Ben-hadad, king of Syria, has sent me to you, saying, Shall I recover from this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha said to him, Go and say to him, You shall certainly recover. But the LORD has shown me that he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he settled his face steadfastly until he was ashamed. And the man of God wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hazael said, Why does my lord weep? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hazael said, What! [Is] your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has shown me that you [shall be] king over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And he answered, He told me you would surely recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it happened on the next day he took a thick cloth and dipped [it] in water, and spread it on his face so that he died. And Hazael reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the fifth year of Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat [being] then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab did; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David His servant's sake, as He promised him to give him a light to his sons forever</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehoram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him. And he rose by night and struck the Edomites who were all around him, and the commanders of the chariots. And the people fled into their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the rest of the acts of Jehoram, and all that he did, [are] they not written in the Book of the Matter of the Days of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehoram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the twelfth year of Jehoram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ahaziah [was] twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab, for he [was] the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went with Jehoram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth of Gilead. And the Syrians wounded Jehoram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And king Jehoram went back to be healed in Jezreel from the wounds which the Syrians had given him in Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
