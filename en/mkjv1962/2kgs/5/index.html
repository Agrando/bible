He was also a mighty man, [but] a leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and captured a little girl out of the land of Israel. And she waited on Naaman's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And she said to her mistress, I wish my lord [were] with the prophet in Samaria! For he would recover him from his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And [one] went in and told his lord, saying, This and this said the girl from the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king of Syria said, Go, go in and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he came in [with] the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you. And you shall recover him of his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it happened when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, [Am] I God, to kill and to make alive, that this [man] sends to me to recover a man from his leprosy? For consider now, and see, for he is coiling himself toward me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? Let him now come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come to you, and you shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Naaman was angry, and went away. And he said, Behold, I said within myself, He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>[Are] not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them, and be clean? And he turned and went away in a rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his servants came near and spoke to him and said, My father, [if] the prophet had told you [to do] a great thing, would you not have done [it]? How much rather then, when he says to you, Wash and be clean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went down and dipped seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh came again like the flesh of a little boy, and he was clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company. And he came and stood before him. And he said, Behold, now I know that [there is] no God in all the earth, but in Israel. And now please take a blessing from your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said, [As] the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it, but he refused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Naaman said, Please shall there not then be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth? For your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In this thing may Jehovah pardon your servant, that when my master goes to the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he is supported by my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon; when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Jehovah pardon your servant in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Go in peace. And he went away from him a little way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hand that which he brought. But, [as] the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Gehazi followed after Naaman. And Naaman saw [him] running after him, and descended down from the chariot to meet him. And he said, [Is] all well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, All [is] well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, this now, two young men from mount Ephraim of the sons of the prophets have come to me. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing. And he laid [them] on two of his servants. And they carried them before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he came to the hill, and he took from their hand and stowed them in the house. And he let the men go, and they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where [from], Gehazi? And he said, Your servant did not go here or there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him, Did not my heart go [with you] when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive silver and to receive clothing and olive-yards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your seed forever. And he went out from his presence as leprous as snow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
