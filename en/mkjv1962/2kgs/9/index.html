And you shall go in and make him rise up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And take the box of oil and pour [it] on his head, and say, So says the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel. And you shall open the door, and flee, and shall not wait.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the young man went, the servant of the prophet, [to] Ramoth in Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And [he] came in, and, behold, the commanders of the army [were] sitting. And he said, I have an errand to you, commander. And Jehu said, To which of all of us? And he said, To you, commander.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head and said to him, So says Jehovah God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you shall strike the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD at the hand of Jezebel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish. And I will cut off from Ahab everyone that urinates against the wall, both bound and free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in a part of Jezreel, and none [shall be there] to bury [her]. And he opened the door and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehu went out to the servants of his lord. And [one] said to him, Well? Why did this mad man come to you? And he said to them, You know the man and what he had to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said, [It is] false. Tell us now! And he said, This and this he spoke to me, saying, So says the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they hurried and each man took his garment and put [it] under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi plotted against Jehoram. And Jehoram was keeping [watch at] Ramoth in Gilead, he and all Israel before Hazael king, of Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And king Jehoram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael the king of Syria. And Jehu said, If it is your minds, [then] let no escapee leave to go to tell [it] in Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehu rode in the chariot and went to Jezreel. For Jehoram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Jehoram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel. And [he] saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Jehoram said, Take a horseman and send to meet them, and let him say, [Is it] peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the rider on horseback went to meet him and said, So says the king, [Is it] peace? And Jehu said, What do you [have to do] with peace? Turn behind me! And the watchman reported, saying, The messenger came to them, but he does not come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he sent a second rider on horseback, who came to them and said, So says the king, [Is it] peace? And he answered, What [do you have] to do with peace? Turn behind me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the watchman reported, saying, He came up to them, but does not come again. And the driving [is] like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehoram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Jehoram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his own chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it happened when Jehoram saw Jehu, he said, [Is it] peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts [are so] many?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehoram turned his hands and fled and said to Ahaziah, Treachery, Ahaziah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehu drew a bow and struck Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to Bidkar his commander, Take him up [and] throw him in the portion of the field of Naboth of Jezreel. For, remember, you and I rode together after Ahab his father, and the LORD laid this burden on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Surely, yesterday I have seen the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, says the LORD, and I will repay you in this portion, says the LORD. And now, take [him] and throw him into the portion, according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw, [he] fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him and said, Strike him also in the chariot, at the going up to Gur, that [is near Ibleam. And [he] fled to Megiddo, and died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And in the eleventh year of Jehoram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jehu had come to Jezreel. And Jezebel heard, and had painted her face and adorned her head, and looked out at a window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jehu came to the gate. And she said, [Was it] peace [to] Zimri the slayer of his lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who [is] with me? Who? And two [or] three eunuchs looked out at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said, Throw her down! And they threw her down. And [some] of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses. And he trampled her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had come in, he ate and drank, and said, Go, now see this cursed [woman] and bury her. For she is a king's daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of [her] hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they came again and told him. And he said, [This is] the word of the LORD which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the dead body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, [so] that they shall not say, This [is] Jezebel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
