The captain of his host was Sisera who lived in Harosheth of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron. And he mightily oppressed the sons of Israel twenty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, judged Israel at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim. And the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she sent and called for Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will draw Sisera to you, the captain of Jabin's army, at the river Kishon, together with his chariots and his multitude. And I will deliver him into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go. But if you will not go with me, I will not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she said, I will surely go with you. But the journey that you take shall not be for your honor, for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And he went up with ten thousand men at his feet. And Deborah went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Heber the Kenite, of the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent toward the plain of Zaanaim, near Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Sisera gathered all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people with him, from Harosheth of the nations to the river of Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Deborah said to Barak, Up! For this [is] the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the LORD gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD struck Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the army, with the edge of the sword in front of Barak, so that Sisera got down from the chariot and fled on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Barak pursued the chariots and after the army, to Harosheth of the nations. And all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Sisera fled on his feet to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. For [there was] peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in my lord, turn in to me. Do not fear. When he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a rug.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink, and covered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again he said to her, Stand [in] the door of the tent, and it shall be when any man comes asking of you, saying, Is there any man here? You shall say, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a peg of the tent and put a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the peg into his temple, and beat it into the ground. For he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, as Barak followed Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, Come and I will show you the man whom you seek. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the peg was in his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the hand of the sons of Israel went on, and pressed hard against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
