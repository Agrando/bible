And now get her for me for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And his father and his mother said to him, [Is there] no woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she pleases me very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But his father and his mother did not know that it [was] from the LORD, that He [was] looking for an occasion against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines had the rule over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Samson and his father and his mother went down to Timnath. And they came to the vineyards of Timnath. And, behold, a young lion roared to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he tore it as he would have torn a kid; and nothing was in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he went down and talked with the woman. And she pleased Samson very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the dead body of the lion. And behold! A swarm of bees and honey [was] in the dead body of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he took some of it in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother. And he gave to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the dead body of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his father went down to the woman. And Samson made a feast there, for so the young men used to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened when they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samson said to them, I will now put forth a riddle to you. If you certainly tell it to me [within] the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty linen blouses and thirty changes of garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if you cannot tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen blouses and thirty changes of garments. And they said to him, Put forth your riddle so that we may hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And in] three days they were not able to declare the riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it happened on the seventh day they said to Samson's wife, Lure your husband so that he may tell the riddle to us, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you called us to take what we have? [Is it] not [so] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You only hate me, and do not love [me]. You have put forth a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told [it] to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told my father nor to my mother, and shall I tell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted. And on the seventh day, he told her, because she pressed hard upon him. And she told the riddle to the sons of her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey, and what stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found [out my riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave changes of garments to them who told what the riddle meant. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, who had served as his friend.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
