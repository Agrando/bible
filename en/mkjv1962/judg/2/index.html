And I said, I will never break My covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And you shall make no treaty with those who live in this land. You shall throw down their altars. But you have not obeyed My voice. What [is] this that you have done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened when the Angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they called the name of that place The Place of Weeping. And they sacrificed there to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Joshua had let the people go, the sons of Israel left, each man to his inheritance, to possess the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD that He did for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD, nor even the works which He had done for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt. And they followed other gods of the gods of the people who were around them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they forsook the LORD and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of spoilers who spoiled them. And He sold them into the hand of their enemies all around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the LORD raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who spoiled them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And yet they would not listen to their judges, but they went lusting after other gods, and bowed themselves to them. They turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, for they had obeyed the commandments of the LORD; these did not do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the LORD raised judges up for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the LORD took pity because of their groanings before their oppressors and their crushers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it happened when the judge was dead, they returned and made themselves more rotten than their fathers in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the anger of the LORD glowed against Israel. And He said, Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to My voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I also from now on will not expel any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>so that by them I may test Israel, whether they are keeping the way of the LORD, to go in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD left those nations, without driving them out quickly. And He did not deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
