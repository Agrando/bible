And [he] said, I will go in to my wife into the room. But her father would not allow him to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And her father said, I truly thought that you utterly hated her, and I gave her to your companion. [Is] not her younger sister fairer than she is? Please, let her be for you instead of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Samson said concerning them, Now I shall be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do evil with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took fire brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a fire brand in the middle between two tails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And [he] set the brands on fire, he let [them] go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and also the standing grain, with the vineyards and olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Samson said to them, Though you have done this, yet I will be avenged of you, and after that I will stop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. And he went down and lived in the top of the rock Etam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Philistines went up and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? And they answered, We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Do you not know that the Philistines [are] rulers over us? What have you done to us? And he said to them, As they have done to me, so I have done to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said to him, We have come to bind you so that we may deliver you into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall upon me yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they spoke to him, saying, No, but we will tie you up and deliver you into their hand. But surely we will not kill you. And they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He came to Lehi, and the Philistines shouted against him. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords on his arms became as flax that has been burned with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass I have killed a thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened when he had made an end of speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Hill of the Jawbone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he was very thirsty and called upon the LORD and said, You have given this great deliverance into the hand of Your servant. And now shall I die with thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But God cut open a hollow place and water came out there. And he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore, its name [is] called Fountain of the Praying One, which is in Lehi to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
