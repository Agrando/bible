And the sons of Israel said, Speak. How did this evil happen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah of Benjamin to stay the night, my concubine and I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the men of Gibeah rose against me and set upon the house all around me at night. They intended to kill me. And they raped my concubine, and she is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the land of the inheritance of Israel. For they have committed evil and folly in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, you [are] all sons of Israel. Give here your advice and counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all people rose as one man, saying, Let no man go to his tent, and do not let any of us turn to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now this [is] the thing which we will do to Gibeah, [going] against it by lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and we will take ten men of a hundred of all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to bring food for the people, so that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may do according to all the folly which they have done in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every man of Israel was gathered against the city, all together as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin saying, What wickedness [is] this that is done among you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, therefore, deliver the men, the sons of Belial, who [are] in Gibeah, so that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the sons of Benjamin gathered out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the sons of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Among all this people [were] seven hundred chosen men, left-handed. Every one could sling stones at a hair's breadth, and not miss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword. All these [were] men of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Israel rose and went up to the house of God and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us [shall go up] first to the battle against the sons of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sons of Israel rose up early in the morning, and camped against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin. And the men of Israel put themselves in order, ready to fight against them at Gibeah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah and destroyed to the earth twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and set their battle in order again in the place where they put themselves in order the first day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the sons of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel from the LORD saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the sons of Israel came near against the sons of Benjamin the second day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Benjamin went forth to meet them again from Gibeah the second day and again destroyed to the earth eighteen thousand men of the sons of Israel. All these drew the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And all the sons of Israel, and all the people, went up and came into the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God [was] there in those days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother, or shall I stop? And the LORD said, Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Israel set ambushers all around Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in order against Gibeah, as at other times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people, [and] were drawn away from the city. [And they] began to strike some of the people and to kill, as at other times, in the highways-- one of which goes up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field-- about thirty men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the sons of Benjamin said, They [are] beaten before us as at the first. But the sons of Israel said, Let us flee and draw them from the city to the highways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and marshalled at Baal-tamar. And the ambush of Israel broke forth from their place, from the plains of Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was heavy. But they did not know that evil [was] near them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD struck Benjamin before Israel. And the sons of Israel destroyed in Benjamin twenty-five thousand and a hundred men that day. All these drew the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were beaten. For the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin because they trusted to the ambush which they had set against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah. And the ambush marched and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a sign was set between the men of Israel and the ambush, caused go up a great smoke rising up from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to strike [and] kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons. For they said, Surely they are stricken down before us as [in] the first battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the rising of a pillar [of smoke] began to go up out of the city. And Benjamin turned behind them, and behold, the whole city had gone up toward the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the men of Israel turned again, and the men of Benjamin were amazed. For they saw that evil had touched them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they turned before the men of Israel, to the way of the wilderness. But the battle overtook them. And those who [came] out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>They encircled Benjamin [and] they chased them without rest, [and] trod them down until [they were] against Gibeah toward the sunrise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And there fell from Benjamin eighteen thousand. All these [were] men of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. And they gleaned of [them] in the highways five thousand men, and pursued hard after them to Gidom and killed two thousand men of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All of these [were] men of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness, to the rock Rimmon, and they stayed in the rock Rimmon four months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the sons of Israel turned again to the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, from the entire city to livestock, to all that was found. Also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
