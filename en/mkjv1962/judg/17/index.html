Behold, I took it. And his mother said, Be blessed of the LORD, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when he had given back the eleven hundred of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly given the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image. And now I am giving it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he gave the money back to his mother. And his mother took two hundred [shekels] of silver and gave them to a refiner, who made of it an engraved image and a molten image. And they were in the house of Micah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod and household gods, and anointed one of his sons, who became his priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In those days [there was] no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was a young man out of Bethlehem-judah of the family of Judah, and he [was] a Levite.

And he said to him, I [am] a Levite of Bethlehem-judah, and I go to live where I may find a place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Micah said to him, Live with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten [shekels] of silver by the year, and a suit of clothes, and your food.
