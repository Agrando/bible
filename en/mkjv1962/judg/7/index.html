And twenty-two thousand of the people returned. And there remained ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are still [too] many. Bring them down to the water, and I will separate them for you there. It shall be [that of] whom I say to you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you. And of whomever I say to you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he brought down the people to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, Everyone who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set him apart; also everyone who bows down upon his knees to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the number of them who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, [was] three hundred men. But all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Gideon, I will save you by the three hundred men who lapped, and will deliver the Midianites into your hand. And let all the other people go, each man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the people took provisions in their hand, and their ram's horns. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, each man to his tent, and kept those three hundred men. And the army of Midian was below him in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it happened on that night, the LORD said to him, Arise, go down to the army, for I have delivered it into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if you fear to go down, go with Phurah your servant down to the army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you shall hear what they shall say. And afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down to the army. Then he went down with Phurah his servant to the edge of the ranks in the army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Midianites and the Amalekites, and all the sons of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude, and their camels without number, like the sand by the seaside for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Gideon had come, behold, a man told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and struck it so that it fell, and overturned it, so that the tent lay along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else except the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. For into his hand God has delivered Midian and all the army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it happened, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the meaning of it, he worshiped. And [he] returned to the army of Israel, and said, Arise! For the LORD has delivered the host of Midian into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies. And he put a ram's horn in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and torches inside the pitchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise. And, behold, when I come to the edge of the camp, it shall be, as I do, so you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I blow with a ram's horn, I and all who are with me, then you blow the ram's horns also on every side of all the camp, and shout, For Jehovah and for Gideon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Gideon and the hundred men with him came to the edge of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch. And they had but newly set the watch. And they blew the ram's horns and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the three companies blew the ram's horns and broke the pitchers and held the torches in their left hands and the ram's horns in their right hands to blow. And they cried, A sword for Jehovah and for Gideon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they stood, each man in his place, all around the camp. And all the army ran, and cried, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the three hundred blew the ram's horns. And the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the army. And the army fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, to the border of Abel-meholah, to Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel were called out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and ran after the Midianites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan before them. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves. And they captured the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb. And they killed Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. And they pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
