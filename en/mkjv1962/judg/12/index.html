We will burn your house upon you with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jephthah said to them, My people and I were at great strife [with] the sons of Ammon. And when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When I saw that you did not deliver me, I took my life in my hand and passed over against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand, and why have you come up against me, to fight against me today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jephthah called up all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites [are] fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Gileadites took the fords of Jordan before the Ephraimites. And it happened that when one of those Ephraimites who had escaped said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? And he said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they said to him, Please say Shibboleth. And he said, Sibboleth, for he could not manage to pronounce [it] right.
