And the sons of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the sons of Israel, who delivered them, Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel and went out to war. And the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, into his hand. And his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD. And the LORD made Eglon the king of Moab strong against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek. And he went forth and struck Israel, and took the city of palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Ehud made himself a dagger which had two edges, a cubit long. And he tied it under his clothing upon his right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab. And Eglon was a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had finished offering the present, he sent away the people who carried the present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he himself turned again from the graven images by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret message for you, O, king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ehud came to him. And he was sitting [in] the cool roof room which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to you. And he rose out of his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the haft also went in after the blade. And the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly. And the dung came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the room upon him, and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had gone out, his servants came. And they looked, and, behold, the doors of the roof room were locked, they said, Surely he [is] covering his feet in his cool roof room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they waited until they were ashamed. And, behold, he did not open the doors of the room. And they took a key and opened them. And behold, their lord [had] fallen down dead on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the graven images, and escaped to Seirath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it happened, when he had come, he blew a ram's horn in the mountain of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him from the mountain, and he before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, Follow after me. For the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and did not allow a man to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they killed about ten thousand of the men of Moab at that time, all lusty, and all men of might. And there did not escape a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subdued under the hand of Israel that day. And the land had rest eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. And he also delivered Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
