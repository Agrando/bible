For they had made a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sons of Israel repented themselves for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters for wives?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, What one [is there] of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the people were numbered, and behold, none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead [were there.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go, and you shall strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the sword, with the women and the sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this [is] the thing that you shall do. You shall utterly destroy every male and every woman who has lain with man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had known no man by lying with any male. And they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which [is] in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the whole congregation sent to speak to the sons of Benjamin who were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Benjamin came again at that time. And they gave them wives whom they had saved alive, of the women of Jabesh-gilead. And yet so they were not enough for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the people repented themselves for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a break in the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they said, [There must be] an inheritance for those of Benjamin who have escaped, so that a tribe may not be destroyed out of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>However, we may not give them wives of our daughters. For the sons of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed [is] he who gives a wife to Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they said, Behold, [there is] a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then you come out of the vineyards and catch you a wife for every man from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, we will say to them, Be favorable to them for our sakes, because we did not reserve each man a wife in the war. For if you did not give to them at this time, you would be guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number, from those that danced, whom they caught. And they went and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities and lived in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, each man to his tribe and to his family. And they went out from there every man to his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In those days [there was] no king in Israel. Every man did the right in his own eyes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
