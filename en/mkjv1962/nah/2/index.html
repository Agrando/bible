Guard the rampart. Watch the way, make your loins strong, firm up [your] power mightily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For the LORD has turned away the glory of Jacob, as the glory of Israel. For the plunderers have plundered them, and have destroyed their vine branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The shield of his mighty ones has become red; the mighty men [are] in scarlet; the chariots flame like iron torches in the day of his preparation. And the cypresses are made to quiver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The chariots race madly in the streets; they shall run to and fro in the open squares. Their appearance [is] like torches; they dart about like lightnings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He shall remember his nobles; they shall stumble in their walking; they shall make haste to its wall, and the covering shall be prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she who stood firm is uncovered and caused to go away. And her slave women are moaning like the sound of doves, beating their breast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Nineveh [is] like a pool of water from her days; yet they are fleeing. Halt! Halt! they cry, but none looks back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Seize the silver; seize the gold; for [there is] no end to the treasures; riches from all precious vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[She is] empty and void and waste; and the heart melts, and the knees knock, and trembling [is] on all the loins; and all their faces collect heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion [and] the lioness walked, [and] the lion's cub, and no one made [them] afraid?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The lion tears in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangles for his lionesses, and filled his holes [with] prey, and his dens with torn prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, I [am] against you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions.
