It [is] a lie, and full of plunder; the prey is not withdrawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The sound of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of a wheel, and of a galloping horse, and of a bounding chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The horseman lifts up both the bright sword and the lightning of the spear. And many [are] slain, and [there are] a mass of dead bodies, and no end of corpses; they stumble on their dead bodies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because of the many harlotries of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of sorceries who sells nations by her harlotries, and families by her sorceries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I [am] against you, says the LORD of hosts; and I will uncover your skirts upon your face. And I will cause the nations to see your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will cast filth upon you, and will dishonor you, and will set you as a gazing-stock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it shall be that all those who look upon you shall flee from you, and say, Nineveh is laid waste; who will weep for her? From where shall I seek comforters for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Are you better than No Amon, that dwelt among the Nile branches, waters all around her, whose rampart [was] the sea, the waters her wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ethiopia and Egypt [were] her strength, yea, without end. Put and Lubim were among your helpers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet she [went] into exile; she went into captivity, and her young children also were dashed to pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You also shall be drunken; you shall be hidden, you also shall seek strength because of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All your strongholds shall be like fig trees with the first fruits; if they are shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, your people in your midst [are] women. The gates of your land shall surely be opened to your enemies; the fire shall devour your bars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Draw waters for the siege; fortify your strongholds; go into the clay, and tread the mortar; make the brick mold strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There fire shall devour you; the sword shall cut you off, it shall eat you up like the locust. Make yourself as many as the larvae, multiply yourself like the locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You have multiplied your merchants above the stars of heaven; the locust larvae shall strip off and fly away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your rulers [are] like the locusts, and your officials are a swarm of locusts that camp in the hedges in the cold day; the sun rises, and they flee, and the place where they [are] is not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria. Your nobles are at rest; your people are scattered upon the mountains, and no one is gathering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There is no healing of your fracture; your wound is grievous; all who hear the news of you shall clap the hands over you; for upon whom has your wickedness not passed continually?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
