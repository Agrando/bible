For since [the] fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this is hidden from them [by their] willing it, that the heavens were of old, and the earth out of the water, and through water, being held together by the word of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>through which the world that then was, being flooded by water, perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the present heavens and the earth being kept in store by the same word, are being kept for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, beloved, let not this one thing be hidden [from you], that one day [is] with [the] Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, not purposing that any [of us] should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in [the] night, in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, and [the] elements will melt with fervent heat. And the earth and the works in it will be burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then, all these things being [about to be] dissolved, what sort ought you to be in holy behavior and godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>looking for and rushing the coming of the Day of God, on account of which [the] heavens, being on fire, will melt away, and [the] elements will melt, burning with heat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, beloved, looking for these things, be diligent, spotless, and without blemish, to be found by Him in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And think of the long-suffering of our Lord [as] salvation (as our beloved brother Paul also has written to you according to the wisdom given to him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable pervert, as also [they do] the rest of the Scriptures, to [their] own destruction).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, beloved, knowing beforehand, beware lest being led away with the error of the lawless, you fall from [your] own steadfastness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But grow in grace and [in] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him [be] the glory, both now and to [the] day of eternity. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
