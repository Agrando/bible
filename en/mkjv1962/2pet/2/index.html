They are darers, self-pleasing; not trembling [at] glories, speaking evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Where angels, [who are] greater in power and might, do not bring a reproaching accusation against them before [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these, as unreasoning natural brute animals having been born for capture and corruption, speak evil of the things that they do not understand. And they will utterly perish in their own corruption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>being about to receive [the] wages of unrighteousness, deeming indulgence [as] pleasure in [the] daytime, and reveling [in] spots and blemishes, feasting along with you in their deceits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>having eyes full of adultery and never ceasing from sin, alluring unstable souls, having a heart exercised [with] covetousness. [They are] cursed children</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who have forsaken the right way and have gone astray, following the way of Balaam [the son] of Beor, who loved [the] wages of unrighteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but had reproof of [his] lawbreaking, a dumb ass speaking in a man's voice, held back the madness of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are wells without water, clouds driven with a tempest, for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they lure through [the] lusts of the flesh, by unbridled lust, the ones who were escaping from those who live in error;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>promising them liberty, they themselves are the slaves of corruption. For by whom anyone has been overcome, even to this one he has been enslaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if [they] have escaped the pollutions of the world through the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and are again entangled, they have been overcome by these, [their] last things are worse [than] the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it would have been better for them not to have fully known the way of righteousness, than fully knowing [it], to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But [the] word of the true proverb has happened to them: [The] dog turning to [his] own vomit; and, [The] washed sow to wallowing in the mire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
