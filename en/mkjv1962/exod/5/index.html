I do not know Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He fall upon us with plague or with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king of Egypt said to them, Moses and Aaron, Why do you keep the people from their work? Get to your burdens!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now [are] many, and you make them rest from their burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers the same day, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall lay upon them the number of bricks which they have made before now. You shall not take away from it. For they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go sacrifice to our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let more work be laid upon the men, and let them labor in it. And do not let them regard vain words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out. And they spoke to the people, saying, So says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go and get straw where you can find it, yet not any of your work shall be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people were scattered through all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the taskmasters hurried [them], saying, Finish your works, the thing of a day, just as when there was straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the overseers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten. [And they] demanded, Why have you not completed your task in making brick, both yesterday and today, as you did before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the overseers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you deal so with your servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, Make bricks! And behold, your servants [are] beaten, but the fault is in your own people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said, You [are] idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore go now [and] work, for there shall be no straw given to you; yet you shall deliver the number of bricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the overseers of the sons of Israel saw themselves in affliction, after it was said, You shall not take away from your bricks of your daily task.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they met Moses and Aaron standing in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said to them, The LORD look upon you and judge, because you have made our smell to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to kill us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why have You treated this people ill? Why then have you sent me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people. Neither have You delivered Your people at all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
