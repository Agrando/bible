And [there was] no water for the people to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the people wrangled with Moses and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you wrangle with me? Why do you tempt the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the people thirsted there for water. And the people murmured against Moses and said, Why [is] this, [that] You brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? They are almost ready to stone me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Go on in front of the people, and take with you the elders of Israel. And take your rod with which you struck the river, in your hand, and go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb. And you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, so that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the wrangling of the sons of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened when Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. And when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Moses' hands [became] heavy. And they took a stone and put [it] under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. And his hands were steady until the going of the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people by the mouth of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Write this, a memorial in a book, and set [it] in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah My Banner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, A hand [is] on the throne of the LORD; war is to the LORD with Amalek from generation to generation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
