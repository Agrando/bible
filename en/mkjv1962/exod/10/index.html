Let My people go, so that they may serve Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring the locusts into your coast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they shall cover the face of the land, so that one cannot be able to see the earth. And they shall eat the rest of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, which neither your fathers, nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day they were upon the earth until this day. And he turned himself and went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go so that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, Go! Serve the LORD your God. Who [are] the ones that shall go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters. We will go with our flocks and with our herds. For we [must hold] a feast to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, May the LORD be so with you, as I send you and your little ones away. Watch out, for evil [is] before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not so! You men go now and serve the LORD, for it is you who did desire it. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land, all that the hail has left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all the night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested in all the coasts of Egypt, very numerous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened. And they ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. And there did not remain any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste. And he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now please, forgive my sin only this once, and pray to the LORD your God, that He may take away from me this death only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he went out from Pharaoh, and prayed [to] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts and threw them into the Red Sea. There did not remain one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, so that one may even feel the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven. And there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They did not see one another, nor did any rise from his place, [for] three days. But all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, You go serve the LORD. Only let your flocks and your herds be left. Let your little ones also go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, You must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our cattle also shall go with us. There shall not be a hoof left behind. For we must take from them to serve the LORD our God. And we do not know [with] what we must serve the LORD until we come there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said to him, Go away from me! Take heed to yourself; see my face no more. For in the day you see my face you shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, You have spoken well. I will never see your face again.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
