You shall camp before [it], by the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They [are] tangled in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he will follow them. And I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, so that the Egyptians may know that I [am] the LORD. And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king of Egypt was told that the people fled. And the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people. And they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he made his chariot ready, and took his people with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he pursued the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel went out with a high hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army. And they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes. And, behold, the Egyptians marched after them. And they were very afraid. And the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they said to Moses, Have you taken us away to die in the wilderness because [there were] no graves in Egypt? Why have you dealt this way with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Did we not tell you this word in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, so that we may serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to the people, Do not fear. Stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will prepare for you this day. For the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD shall fight for you, and you shall be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Why do you cry to Me? Speak to the sons of Israel, that they go forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it. And the sons of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold! I [am] about to harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. And I will get honor for Me upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, upon his chariots and upon his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD when I have gotten honor for Me upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Angel of God, the one who went before the camp of Israel, moved. And he went to the rear of them. And the pillar of the cloud went from in front of their face and it stood behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. And it was a cloudy and dark night, but it gave light to the night, so that the one did not come near the other all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. And the LORD caused the sea to recede by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground. And the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Egyptians pursued and went after them to the middle of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in the morning watch it happened that the LORD looked to the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the army of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He took off their chariot wheels, and made them go heavily, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea. And the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared. And the Egyptians fled against it. And the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. There did not remain so much as one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the sons of Israel walked upon dry land in the middle of the sea. And the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians. And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians. And the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD and His servant Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
