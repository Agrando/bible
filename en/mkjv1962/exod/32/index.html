And they said to him, Up! Make us gods who shall go before us. For this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden earrings which [are] in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring [them] to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought [them] to Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he took [them] from their hand, and fashioned it with an engraving tool. And he made it a molten calf. And they said, These [are] your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Aaron saw, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made proclamation and said, Tomorrow [is] a feast to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they rose up early on the next day and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Go! Get down, for your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, are corrupted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These [are] your gods, O Israel, who have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it [is] a stiff-necked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now leave Me alone, so that My wrath may become hot against them and so that I may consume them. And I will make of you a great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses prayed to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does Your wrath become hot against Your people whom You have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why should the Egyptians speak and say, He brought them out for harm, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and be moved to pity as to this evil against Your people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit [it] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD was moved to pity as to the evil which He spoke of doing to His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the testimony [were] in his hand. The tablets were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the tablets [were] the work of God, and the writing [was] the writing of God. It [was] engraved on the tablets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua heard the voice of the people in their shouting. And he said to Moses, A sound of war in the camp!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, [It is] not a sound of a cry of victory, nor a sound of the cry of defeat. I [am] hearing the sound of singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it happened, as he came near to the camp and saw the calf and dances, the anger of Moses became hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them at the bottom of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the calf which they had made and burned [it] in the fire, and ground [it] to powder, and dropped [it] upon the water, and made the sons of Israel drink [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to you, that you have brought so great a sin upon them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord become hot. You know the people, that they [are set] on mischief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they said to me, Make us gods who shall go before us. For this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break [it] off. And they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had made them naked to [their] shame among their enemies,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Who [is] on the LORD's side? [Come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel: Each man put his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and kill each one his brother, and each one his neighbor, and each one his kindred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, since each one [has been] against his son, and against his brother, and in order to give you a blessing today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it happened on the next day, Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD. Perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now will You forgive their sin! And if not, I pray You, blot me out of Your book which You have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And now go, lead the people to [the place] of which I have spoken to you. Behold, My Angel shall go before you. And in the day of My visitation I will visit their sin upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD plagued the people because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
