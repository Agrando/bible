For you have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the LORD said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from the heavens for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain amount every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And on the sixth day it shall happen, they shall prepare what they bring in. And it shall be twice as much as they gather day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, At evening, then you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the LORD. For He hears your murmurings against the LORD. And what [are] we, that you murmur against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said, You will see when the LORD shall give you flesh to eat in the evening and bread to the full in the morning, when the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings [are] not against us, but against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before the LORD. For He has heard your murmurings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, they turned toward the wilderness. And behold! The glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, You shall eat flesh at evening, and in the morning you shall be filled [with] bread. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened at evening, the quails came up and covered the camp. And in the morning the dew lay all around the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the layer of dew had gone up, behold, [there was] a small round thing upon the face of the wilderness, small as the hoar-frost upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of Israel saw, they said each one to his brother, What [is] that? For they did not know what it [was]. And Moses said to them, This [is] the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This [is] the thing which the LORD has commanded: Each man gather of it according to his eating, an omer for a head, according to the number of your souls. Each one shall take for those who [are] in his camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, and some less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they measured with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little lacked nothing. They gathered each one according to his eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said, Let no man leave of it until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they did not listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning. And it became rotten [with] maggots, and stank. And Moses was angry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they gathered it every morning, each man according to his eating. And when the sun became hot, it melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it happened, on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, This [is that] which the LORD has said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake [today], and boil what you will boil. And that which remains over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses said. And it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, Eat that today. For today [is] a sabbath to the LORD. Today you shall not find it in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it happened [some] of the people went out on the seventh day in order to gather. And they did not find [any].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the LORD said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See, because the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore He gives you the bread of two days on the sixth day. Each one stay in his place. Let not any one go out of his place on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna. And it [was] like coriander seed, white. And the taste of it [was] like wafers with honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD has commanded: Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations, so that you may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land in which people lived. They ate manna until they came into the borders of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And an omer [is] the tenth part of an ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
