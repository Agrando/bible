And they still brought to him free offerings every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all the wise men who worked all the work of the sanctuary came, every man from his work which they made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough [for] the service of the work which the LORD commanded to make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses commanded, and they caused it to be known throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. And the people were kept from bringing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the stuff which they had was enough for all the work to make it, and too much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And every wise-hearted one among them that worked the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains [of] fine twined bleached [linen], and blue, and purple, and scarlet. He made them with cherubs of skillful work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The length of one curtain [was] twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain was four cubits. The curtains were all of one size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he coupled the five curtains to one another, and he coupled [the other] five curtains to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the edge in the coupling. Likewise he made loops in the outermost side, in the coupling of the second curtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He made fifty loops in one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which [was] in the coupling of the second. The loops held one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps. And it became one tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he made curtains [of] goats' [hair] for the tent over the tabernacle. He made eleven curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The length of one curtain [was] thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of one curtain. The eleven curtains were of one size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he made fifty loops on the outermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and he made fifty loops upon the edge of the curtains which coupled the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he made fifty clasps [of] bronze to couple the tent together, so that it might be one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he made a covering for the tent [of] rams' skins dyed red, and a covering [of] dugong skins above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he made boards for the tabernacle [of] acacia-wood, standing up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The length of a board [was] ten cubits, and the breadth of a board was one and a half cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By two pins the one board was connected, one to another. So he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he made boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two pins, and two sockets under another board for its two pins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And for the other side of the tabernacle, toward the north, he made twenty boards,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and their forty sockets were of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he made six boards for the sides of the tabernacle westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the sides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head of it, to one ring. So he did to both of them in both the corners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there were eight boards. And their sockets [were] sixteen sockets of silver, two sockets under every board.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he made bars of acacia-wood, five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the westward sides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he overlaid the boards [with] gold, and made their rings [of] gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars [with] gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he made a veil [of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined bleached [linen]. He made it the work of an artisan, with cherubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he made for it four pillars [of] acacia. And he overlaid them [with] gold. Their hooks [were of] gold, and he cast four sockets of silver for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he made a screen for the tabernacle door, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined bleached [linen], of needlework;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the five pillars of it, and their hooks. And he overlaid their capitals and their fillets [with] gold, but their five sockets [were of] bronze.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
