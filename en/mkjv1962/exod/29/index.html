Take one bull, the son of the herd, and two rams without blemish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and unleavened [bread], and cakes unleavened mixed with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil. You shall make them [of] wheat flour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And you shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bull and the two rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall take the garments, and clothe Aaron with the tunic, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breast-pocket, and bind it to him with the band of the ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall put the miter upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the miter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then you shall take the anointing oil, and pour on his head, and anoint him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall bring his sons and clothe them [with] tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you shall gird them [with] girdles, Aaron and his sons, and bind turbans on them. And the priest's office shall be theirs for an everlasting statute. And you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall cause a bull to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you shall kill the bull before the LORD, [by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall take of the blood of the bull, and put [it] on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall take all the fat that covers the inward parts, and the lobe on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat on them, and burn [them] upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp. It [is] a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you shall also take one ram. And Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall kill the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle all round upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall cut the ram in pieces, and you shall wash its inward parts and its legs, and put [them] with its pieces and with its head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall burn the whole ram upon the altar. It [is] a burnt offering to the LORD. It [is] a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall take the other ram. And Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then you shall kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put [it] upon the tip of the ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you shall take of the blood on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him. And he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also you shall take from the ram the fat and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the inward parts, and the lobe on the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right shoulder, for it is a ram of consecration;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened [bread] that [is] before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and shall wave them [for] a wave offering before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you shall take them from their hands, and burn [them] upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor before the LORD. It is an offering made by fire to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration and wave it [for] a wave offering before the LORD. And it shall be your portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is lifted from the ram of the consecration, from what [is] Aaron's, and from what is for his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute forever from the sons of Israel. For it [is] a heave offering. And it shall be a heave offering from the sons of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed in them and consecrated in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The one of his sons that is priest in his place shall put them on seven days, when he comes into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy [place].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you shall take the ram of the consecration, and boil its flesh in the holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that [is] in the basket, [by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them. But a stranger shall not eat because they [are] holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if any of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remains until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it [is] holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And so you shall do to Aaron and to his sons according to all things which I have commanded you. You shall consecrate them seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And you shall offer every day a bull, a sin offering for atonement. And you shall cleanse the altar when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You shall make an atonement for the altar seven days, and sanctify it. And it shall be a most holy altar. Whatever touches the altar shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And this [is] what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year day by day forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with the one lamb a tenth part of flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin [of] wine, a drink offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And you shall offer the other lamb at evening; you shall do to it according to the meal offering of the morning, and according to its drink offering, for a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>[This shall be] a burnt offering forever throughout your generations, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD, where I will meet you, to speak there to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there I will meet with the sons of Israel, and Israel shall be sanctified by My glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar. I will also sanctify both Aaron and his sons to minister to Me in the priest's office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt so that I may dwell among them. I [am] the LORD their God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
