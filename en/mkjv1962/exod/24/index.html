And bow yourselves afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Moses alone shall come near the LORD, but they shall not come near. Neither shall the people go up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, All the words which the LORD has said, we will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar below the mountain and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sent young men of the sons of Israel who offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of bullocks to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses took half of the blood, and put [it] in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the ears of the people. And they said, All that the LORD has said we will do, and be obedient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses took the blood and sprinkled [it] on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses went up, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they saw the God of Israel. And [there was] under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the heavens in clearness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And upon the nobles of the sons of Israel He did not lay his hands. Also they saw God, and ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to Me in the mountain, and be there. And I will give you tablets of stone, and the law, and commandments which I have written, so that you may teach them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses rose up, and his attendant Joshua.
