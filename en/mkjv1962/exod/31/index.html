And I have put wisdom in the hearts of all the wise-hearted, so that they may make all that I have commanded you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that [is] upon it, and all the vessels of the tabernacle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the table and its vessels, and the pure lampstand with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the woven garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy [place]. According to all that I have commanded you, they shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Speak also to the sons of Israel, saying, Truly you shall keep My sabbaths. For it [is] a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, to know that I [am] the LORD who sanctifies you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it [is] holy to you. Everyone that defiles it shall surely be put to death. For whoever does [any] work in it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Six days may work be done, but on the seventh [is] the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does [any] work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, [for] an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It [is] a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He gave to Moses, when He had made an end of speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
