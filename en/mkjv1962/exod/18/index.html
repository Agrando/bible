And they asked each other of [their] welfare. And they came into the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and [how] the LORD delivered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jethro said, Blessed [be] the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now I know that Jehovah [is] greater than all gods; for in the thing in which they were proved against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And on the next day it happened that Moses sat to judge the people. And the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What [is] this thing which you do to the people? Why do you sit alone by yourself, and all the people stand by you from morning to evening?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When they have a matter, they come to me. And I judge between one and another, and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that you do [is] not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You will surely wear away, both you and this people that [is] with you. For this thing [is] too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God will be with you. You be for the people toward God, that you may bring the causes to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall make them know the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you shall look out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness. And place [such] over them to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them judge the people at all times. And it shall be, every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge. And make it easier for yourself, and they shall bear with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you will do this thing, and God command you, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they judged the people at all times. The hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses let his father-in-law depart. And he went his way into his own land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
