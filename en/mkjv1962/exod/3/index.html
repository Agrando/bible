And he led the flock to the back side of the desert. And he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a thorn bush. And he looked. And behold! The thorn bush burned with fire! And the thorn bush [was] not burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the thorn bush is not burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see. God called to him out of the midst of the thorn bush, and said, Moses! Moses! And he said, Here I [am].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He said, Do not come near here. Put off your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand [is] holy ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said, I [am] the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people who [are] in Egypt; I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I am coming down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, to bring them up out of that land, to a good land, a large land, to a land flowing [with] milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me. And I have also seen the oppression [with] which the Egyptians oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now go, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses said to God, Who [am] I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He said, I will be with you. And this [shall be] the sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to God, Behold, [when] I come to the sons of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they shall say to me, What [is] His name? What shall I say to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And He said, So you shall say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God said to Moses again, You shall say this to the sons of Israel, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This [is My name forever, and this [is] My title from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go, and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, Jehovah the God of your fathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I have surely visited you and [have seen what] is done to you in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall listen to your voice. And you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt. And you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us. And now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will stretch out My hand and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst of it. And after that he will let you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall be that when you go, you shall not go empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that stays in her house, jewels of silver and jewels of gold and clothing. And you shall put [them] upon your sons and upon your daughters. And you shall plunder the Egyptians.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
