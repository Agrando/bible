Every man and his household came with Jacob:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Reuben; Simeon; Levi; and Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Issachar; Zebulun; and Benjamin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Dan; and Naphtali; Gad; and Asher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls, for Joseph was [already] in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased very much, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty. And the land was filled [with] them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel [are] many and mightier than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it will be when there comes a war, they join also to our enemies, and fight against us, and get out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built treasure cities for Pharaoh, Pithon and Raamses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel serve with harshness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they made their lives bitter with hard work in mortar and in bricks, and in all [kinds of] work in the field; all their work in which they made them do [was] with harshness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, When you midwife the Hebrew women, and look on the birth stools, if it [is] a son, then you shall kill him. But if it [is] a daughter, then she shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved alive the male children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not like the Egyptian women. For they [are] lively, and are delivered before the midwives come in to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and became very mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it happened, because the midwives feared God, [that] He made them houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
