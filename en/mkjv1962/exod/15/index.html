He is my God, and I will glorify Him, my father's God, and I will exalt Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The LORD [is] a Man of war; Jehovah [is] His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea; his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The depths have covered them; they sank into the bottom like a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your right hand, O LORD, has become glorious in power. Your right hand, O LORD, has dashed the enemy in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in the greatness of Your excellency You have overthrown them that rose up against You. You sent forth Your wrath, consuming them like stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And with the blast of Your nostrils the waters were gathered together; the floods stood upright like a heap; the depths were curdled in the heart of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them, I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You blew with Your wind; the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who [is] like You, O LORD, among the gods? Who [is] like You, glorious in holiness, fearful [in] praises, doing wonders?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You in Your mercy have led forth the people [which] You have redeemed. You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The people shall hear, being afraid. Sorrow shall take hold on the people of Philistia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the princes of Edom [were] terrified. Trembling seized upon the mighty men of Moab. All the people of Canaan shall melt away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Fear and dread shall fall upon them. By the greatness of Your arm they shall be still as a stone, until Your people pass over, O LORD; until the people [whom] You have purchased pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place, O LORD, You have made for You to dwell in; the Sanctuary, O LORD, [which] Your hands have established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The LORD shall reign forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them. But the sons of Israel went on dry land in the middle of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand. And all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Miriam answered them, Sing to the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, because it [was] bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he cried to the LORD. And the LORD showed him a tree. And when he had cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a decree and a law for them, and there He tested them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, If you will carefully listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in His sight, and will give ear to His commandments, and keep all His laws, I will put none of these diseases upon you, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I [am] the LORD who heals you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they came to Elim, where [there were] twelve wells of water, and seventy palm trees. And they camped there by the waters.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
