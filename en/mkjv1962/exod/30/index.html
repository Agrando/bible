You shall make it [of] acacia-wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A cubit [shall be] its length, and a cubit its breadth. It shall be square. And two cubits [shall be] the height of it, its horns from itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And you shall overlay it [with] pure gold, its top, and its sides all around, and its horns. And you shall make to it a crown of gold all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And you shall make two golden rings to it under the crown of it, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides of it you shall make it. And they shall be housings for the staves to bear it with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall make the staves [of] acacia-wood and overlay them [with] gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall put it before the veil that [is] by the ark of the testimony, in front of the mercy-seat that is beside the testimony, where I will meet with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Aaron shall burn sweet incense on it every morning; when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You shall offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meal offering.
