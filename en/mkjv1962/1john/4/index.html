And this is the antichrist you heard is coming, and even now is already in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are of the world, therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are of God. He who knows God hears us. The one who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and everyone who loves has been born of God, and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The one who does not love has not known God. For God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this the love of God was revealed in us, because God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son [to be] the propitiation concerning our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and His love is perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By this we know that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we have known and believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In this is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that as He is, so also we are in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment. He who fears has not been perfected in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love Him because He first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For if he does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And we have this commandment from Him, that he who loves God should love his brother also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
