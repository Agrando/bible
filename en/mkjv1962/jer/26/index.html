And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the rulers of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD's [house].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priests and the prophets spoke to the rulers and to all the people, saying, [Let] a death sentence be for this man, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the rulers and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So now make your ways and your doings good, and obey the voice of the LORD your God. And the LORD will repent of the evil that He has spoken against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for me, behold, I [am] in your hand. Do with me as seems good and right to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But know for certain that if you put me to death you shall surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on its people. For truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, There [is] not a sentence of death for this man; for he has spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, So says Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house like the high places of a forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah indeed put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD, and pray to the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which He had spoken against them? So we are doing great evil against our souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the rulers, heard his words, the king tried to put him to death. But when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled and went into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt; Elnathan the son of Achbor, and men with him into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they brought Urijah out of Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and threw his dead body into the graves of the common people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
