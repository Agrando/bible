Then Jeremiah said to him, The LORD has not called your name Pashur, but Terror from All Around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For so says the LORD, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall behold [it]. And I will give all Judah into the king of Babylon's hand, and he will exile them into Babylon, and kill them with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will give all the wealth of this city, and its produce, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah, [even] I will give into the hand of their enemies; who will strip them and take them, and bring them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you, Pashur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. And you shall come to Babylon, and you shall die there, and shall be buried there; you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O LORD, You have deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I, and You have prevailed. I am in derision all the day; everyone laughs at me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For whenever I speak, I cry out, I cry violence and ruin; for the Word of the LORD has been a reproach and a cause of mocking to me all day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, I will not mention Him, nor speak in His name any more. But [His Word] was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with holding in, and I could not stop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I heard the slanders of many, Terror is all around! Expose! Yea, let us expose him! Every man of my peace is watching for my fall, [saying], Perhaps he will be lured away, and we shall prevail over him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the LORD [is] with me like a mighty, awesome one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not overcome me. They shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not be blessed.  Their] everlasting shame shall never be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, O Jehovah of hosts, who tries the righteous [and] sees the reins and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For I have committed my cause to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing to the LORD, praise the LORD; for He has delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed [is] the day in which I was born; let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed [is] the man who brought news to my father, saying, A man child is born to you; making him very glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not; and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because he did not kill me from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb [to be] always great [with me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why did I come forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed in shame?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
