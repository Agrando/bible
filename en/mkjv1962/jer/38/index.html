But he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life as a prize, and shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, and he shall capture it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the rulers said to the king, Please let this man be put to death. For in this way he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the good of this people, but the hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he [is] in your hand. For the king cannot do a thing against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, which [was] in the court of the prison. And they let Jeremiah down with ropes. And there was no water in the pit, only mud. So Jeremiah sank into the mud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, of the eunuchs in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the pit (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ebed-melech went out of the king's house and spoke to the king, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have thrown into the pit. And he is likely to die of hunger in the place where he is, for [there is] no more bread in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take in your hand thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet up out of the pit before he dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Ebed-melech took the men in his hand and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took worn out clothes and worn out rags from there, and let them down by ropes into the pit to Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Ebed-melech, the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Now put the worn out clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes. And Jeremiah did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they drew up Jeremiah with ropes and took him up out of the pit. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to him, into the third gate in the house of the LORD. And the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing. Do not hide anything from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare [it] to you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, [As] the LORD lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, So says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surely go forth to the king of Babylon's rulers, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire. And you shall live, and your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's rulers, then this city shall be given into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and lest they hurt me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver [you]. I beg you, obey the voice of the LORD which I speak to you; so it shall be well to you, and your soul shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if you refuse to go out, this [is] the word that the LORD has shown to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house [shall be] brought out to the king of Babylon's rulers, and they shall say, Your friends have urged you on, and have prevailed against you. Your feet have sunk in the mire, and they have turned away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they shall bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans. And you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if the rulers hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king; do not hide [it] from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then you shall say to them, I presented my cry before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then all the rulers came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they quit speaking with him; for the matter was not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was captured. And he was [there] when Jerusalem was captured.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
