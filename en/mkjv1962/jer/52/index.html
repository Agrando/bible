And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For it was because of the anger of the LORD in Jerusalem and Judah (until He had cast them out from His presence) that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it and built forts against it all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the city was under attack until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, the famine was very grievous in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which [was] by the king's garden. (And the Chaldeans lay around the city all around.) And they went by the way of the plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they took the king and carried him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgments against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the rulers of Judah in Riblah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah. And the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in the fifth month, in the tenth of the month, which [was] the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, chief of the executioners, [who] served the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house. And he burned with fire all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the army of the Chaldeans with the chief of the executioners broke down all Jerusalem's walls all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners exiled [some] of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people who remained in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners left [some] of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for farmers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also the Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that [were] in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the bronze sea in the house of the LORD, and carried all the bronze of them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They also took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they served.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief of the executioners took away the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the cups; what [was] gold, [in] gold; and what [was] silver, [in] silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the two pillars, one sea, and twelve bronze bulls that [were] under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD; the bronze of all these vessels was without weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits. And a line of twelve cubits went around it, and the thickness of it [was] four fingers. [It was] hollow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And a capital of bronze [was] on it. And the height of one capital [was] five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capitals all around, all [of] bronze. The second pillar also, and the pomegranates, [were] like these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there were ninety-six pomegranates on a side; all the pomegranates on the network [were] a hundred all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the chief of the executioners took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He also took out of the city a eunuch who was in charge of the men of war; and seven men from those who were near the king's person, who were found in the city; and the chief scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the king of Babylon struck them and slaughtered them in Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was exiled out of his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This [is] the people whom Nebuchadnezzar exiled: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he exiled from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners exiled seven hundred and forty-five persons of the Jews. All the persons [were] four thousand and six hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it happened in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the [first] year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out from prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who [were] with him in Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he changed his prison garments, and he ate bread before him all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his allowance in continual allowance was given him from the king of Babylon, the matter of a day in its day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
