And take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters, that you may be multiplied there and not become few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be exiled, and pray to the LORD for it. For in its peace you shall have peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For so says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your fortune-tellers in your midst deceive you, nor listen to your dreams which you dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For so says the LORD, When according to My Word seventy years have been fulfilled for Babylon, I will visit you and confirm My good Word to you, to bring you back to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I know the purposes which I am purposing for you, says the LORD; purposes of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then you shall call on Me, and you shall go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall seek Me and find [Me], when you search for Me with all your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will be found by you, says the LORD; and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD. And I will bring you again into the place from where I caused you to be exiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because you have said, The LORD has raised us up prophets in Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so says the LORD of the king who sits on the throne of David, and of all the people who dwell in this city, [and] of your brothers who have not gone out with you into captivity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the plague, and will make them like worthless figs which cannot be eaten from badness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will pursue them with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and a waste, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because they have not listened to My words, says the LORD, which I sent to them by My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending; but you would not hear, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And hear the Word of the LORD, all you exiles, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, about Ahab the son of Kolaiah and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall kill them before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And a curse shall be taken up from them by all the exiles of Judah who [are] in Babylon, saying, May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because they have committed evil in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken lying words in My name, which I have not commanded them; for I [am] He who knows and a witness, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people who [are] at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be officers [in] the house of the LORD, over every madman who prophesies, that you should put him into the stocks and into the collar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now therefore why have you not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this cause he sent to us [in] Babylon, saying, This [exile is] long. Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Send to all the exiles, saying, So says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I did not send him, and he caused you to trust in a lie,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>therefore so says the LORD, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his seed. He shall not have a man to dwell among this people; nor shall he behold the good which I shall do for My people, says the LORD, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
