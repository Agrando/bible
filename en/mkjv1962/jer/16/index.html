[But] they shall be as dung on the face of the earth. And they shall be destroyed by the sword and by famine; and their bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For so says the LORD, Do not enter into the house of mourning; do not go to weep nor moan over them. For I have taken away My peace from this people, says the LORD, even loving-kindness and mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, nor shall [men] mourn for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nor shall [anyone] tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead. Nor shall [anyone] give them the cup of comfort to drink for their father or for their mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also you shall not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For so says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause the voice of mirth to cease out of this place [before] your eyes, and in your days, and the voice of gladness, and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall be, when you declare to this people all these words, and they shall say to you, Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? Or what [is] our iniquity, or what is our sin that we have committed against Jehovah our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then you shall say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken Me, says the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, you walk each one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, without listening to Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>even I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not know, [neither] you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night; where I will not grant you favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that it shall no more be said, [As] the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but, [As] the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where He had driven them. And I will bring them again into their lands that I gave to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says the LORD, and they will fish them. And afterwards I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For My eyes [are] on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity hidden from My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And first I will twice repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled My land, they have filled My inheritance with the dead bodies of their abominable things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the nations shall come to You from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and there is no profit in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make gods to himself, and they [are] no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, behold, I will make them know; this time I will cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My name [is] Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
