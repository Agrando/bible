Send [them] out of My sight, and let them go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it will be, if they say to you, Where shall we go? Then you shall tell them, So says the LORD: Those who [are] for death, go to death; and those for the sword, to the sword; and those for the famine, to the famine; and those for the captivity, to the captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will set over them four kinds, says the LORD; the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will make them a horror to all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Or who shall weep over you? Or who shall turn aside to ask your welfare?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have forsaken Me, says the LORD; you have gone backward; therefore I will stretch out My hand against you, and destroy you; I am weary with repenting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will winnow them with a fork in the gates of the land; I will bereave [them] of sons; I will destroy My people, since they do not turn from their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their widows are more numerous about Me than the sand of the seas; I have brought on them, against a mother of a young man, a ravager at noonday; I have caused anguish and terror to fall on her suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She who bore seven languishes; she has breathed out her life; her sun has gone down while [it was] yet day. She has been ashamed and humiliated; and I will deliver the rest of them to the sword before their enemies, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not loaned, nor have men loaned to me; [yet] every one curses me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The LORD said, Truly I will free you for good. Truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can one break iron, iron or bronze from the north?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your wealth and your treasures I will give for prey, not for price, [but] for all your sins, even in all your borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make [you] pass with your enemies into a land [which] you do not know. For a fire has been kindled in My anger; it shall burn against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O LORD, You know; remember me and visit me, and take vengeance for me on those who seek to hurt me. Do not take me away in Your long-suffering; know that for Your sake I have suffered rebuke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your words were found, and I ate them; and Your Word was to me the joy and gladness of my heart; for I am called by Your name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I did not sit in the circle of mockers, nor rejoice; I sat alone because of Your hand; for You have filled me with indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why has my pain been without end, and why is my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You surely are to me like a deceitful brook, waters that cannot be trusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore so says the LORD, If you turn back, then I will bring you again; you shall stand before Me. And if you take the precious from the worthless, you shall be as My mouth. Let them turn back to you, but do not return to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not overcome you; for I [am] with you to save you and to deliver you, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the evil ones.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
