And do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if you do this thing indeed, then there shall enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if you will not hear these words, I swear by Myself, says the LORD, that this house shall become a ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For so says the LORD to the king of Judah's house, You [are] Gilead to Me, [and] the head of Lebanon. Yet surely I will make you a wilderness, cities with no people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will prepare destroyers against you, each one with his weapons. And they shall cut down your choice cedars, and throw [them] into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say each one to his neighbor, Why has the LORD done this to this great city?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Weep not for the dead, nor moan for him; [but] weep bitterly for him who goes away. For he shall return no more, nor see his native country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For so says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned in the place of Josiah his father, who went forth out of this place: he shall not return there any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he shall die in the place where they have exiled him and shall see this land no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness and his upper rooms without justice; his neighbor serves without pay, and he does not give him his work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who says, I will build myself a wide house and large rooms, and cuts out windows for himself, and puts in a cedar ceiling, and paints it with vermilion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you reign, because you lust to excel in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then [it was] well with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then [it was] well with him. Was this not to know Me? says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But your eyes and your heart [are] for nothing but your unjust gain, and to shed innocent blood, and for cruelty, and to do violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore so says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, They shall not mourn for him, [saying], Ah, my brother! or, Ah, sister! They shall not mourn for him, [saying], Ah, lord! or, Ah, his glory!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall be buried [with] the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Lebanon, and cry. And lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim, for all your lovers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I spoke to you in your prosperity; [but] you said, I will not hear. This [has been] your way from your youth, for you have not obeyed My voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall eat up all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; surely then you will be ashamed and humiliated for all your wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O dweller in Lebanon, nested in the cedars, how you will groan when pangs come to you, the pain as one giving birth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[As] I live, says the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on My right hand, yet I would pull you out of there!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand [of those] whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will cast you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born. And there you shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land to which they desire to return, there they shall not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[Is] this man Coniah a despised broken jar? [Is he] a vessel in which there [is] no pleasure? Why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they do not know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth! Hear the word of the LORD!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So says the LORD, Write this man down as childless, a man who will not be blessed in his days. For no man of his seed shall be blessed, sitting on the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
