They must surely be lifted, because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them; for they cannot do evil nor good, for it is not in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[There is] none like You, O LORD; You [are] great, and Your name [is] great in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who would not fear You, O King of nations? For fear belongs to You, because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, [there is] none like You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they are all at once foolish and animal-like; the tree [is] an example of vanities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the goldsmith. Violet and purple [is] their clothing; they [are] all the work of skillful ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the LORD [is] the true God, He [is] the living God, and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to stand His fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So you shall say to them, The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When He utters His voice, [there is] a noise of many waters in the heavens. He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightnings with rain, and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every man is stupid for [lack of] knowledge; every refiner is put to shame by the graven image; for his molten image is a lie, and no breath is in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They [are] vanity, the work of delusion; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Portion of Jacob [is] not like them; for He [is] the Maker of all things; and Israel [is] the rod of His inheritance. Jehovah of hosts [is] His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up your bundle from the ground, you who live under the siege.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For so says the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the people of the land at this time, and will distress them, so that they may find [Me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe [to] me for my breaking! My wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this [is] a malady, and I must bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tabernacle is ravaged, and all my cords are broken; My sons went away from me, and they [are] not. [There is] none to stretch out My tabernacle any more, and to set up My curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the pastors have become stupid, and have not sought the LORD, therefore they shall not be blessed, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, the noise of the rumor has come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a den of jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O LORD, I know that the way of man does not [belong] to man; [it is] not in man who walks to direct his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out Your fury on the nations who do not know You, and on the families who do not call on Your name; for they have eaten up Jacob and have devoured him, and have destroyed him, and have made his dwelling desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
