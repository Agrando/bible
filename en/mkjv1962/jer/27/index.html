And I have also given him the beast of the field to serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his own land comes. And then many nations and great kings shall enslave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be, the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish, says the LORD, with the sword and with the famine, and with the plague, until I have destroyed them by his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As for you, do not listen to your prophets, nor to your fortune tellers, nor to your dreamers, nor to your conjurers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out and you should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the nations who bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those I will leave it on their own land, says the LORD. And [they] shall work it and dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, as the LORD has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon. For they prophesy a lie to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have not sent them, says the LORD; yet they prophesy a lie in My name, so that I might drive you out, and that you might perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also I spoke to the priests and to all the people, saying, So says the LORD, Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon. For they prophesy a lie to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. For why should this city be laid waste?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if they [are] prophets, and if the Word of the LORD is with them, let them now pray to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and [in] the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For so says Jehovah of hosts, concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels which remain in this city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he exiled Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yes, so says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain [in] the house of the LORD and [in] the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall be carried to Babylon, and they shall be there until the day that I visit them, says the LORD. Then I will bring them up and give them back to this place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
