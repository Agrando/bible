Behold, As the clay in the potter's hands, [so are] you in My hand, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck it up and to pull it down, and to destroy [it] ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>if that nation, against whom I have spoken, will turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build it and to plant [it] ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>if it does evil in My sight, not to obey My voice, then I will repent of the good with which I said I would do them good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now then please, speak to the men of Judah, and to the people of Jerusalem, saying, So says the LORD: Behold, I am forming evil against you, and devising a plan against you. Return now, each one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said, There is no hope; but we will walk after our own ways, and we will each one do [according to] the stubbornness of his evil heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore so says the LORD, Ask now among the nations; who has heard the like of this? The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does the snow of Lebanon forsake the rock of the field? [Or] shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because My people have forgotten Me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways [from] the old paths, to walk [in] by-paths, not [in] the highway,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to make their land desolate [and] a hissing forever. Everyone who passes by will be amazed, and will wag his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they said, Come and let us plot schemes against Jeremiah. For the law shall not perish from the priest, nor wisdom from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pay attention to me; O LORD, and attend to the voice of my foes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Should evil be repaid for good? For they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before You to do good for them, [and] to turn away Your wrath from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore deliver up their sons to the famine, and give them over to the hand of the sword. And let their wives be bereaved, and widows, and their men [be] slain of death; let their young men be struck by the sword in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let a cry be heard from their houses, when You suddenly bring a raiding party on them. For they have dug a pit to take me, and have hidden snares for my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet, LORD, You know all their counsel against me to kill [me]. Do not forgive their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from Your sight, but let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
