All that devour him shall offend; evil shall come on them, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear the Word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So says the LORD, What injustice have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far from Me and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Nor did they say, Where [is] the LORD who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of dry places, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man lived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The priests did not say, Where [is] the LORD? And they who handle the law did not know Me; the shepherds also rebelled against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things not profitable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will contend with you, says the LORD, and with your son's sons I will enter into judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For pass over the coasts of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and carefully consider, and see if there is [such a] thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Has a nation changed [their] gods who are yet no gods? But My people have changed their Glory for that which does not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be amazed, O heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; be completely desolated, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of living waters, to hew out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>[Is] Israel a servant? Or [is] he a servant of the house? Why has he become a prey?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The young lions roared against him; they gave their voice. And they made his land a waste; his cities are burned without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also the sons of Noph and Tahapanes have fed on the crown of your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have you not brought this on yourself, in that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, when He led you by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now what is for you toward the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or what for you toward Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your own evil shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you, therefore know and see that [it is] an evil and bitter [thing] that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, and that My fear [is] not in you, says the Lord Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For long ago you broke your yoke [and] tore up your bonds; and you said, I will not transgress, when on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down [like] a harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet I planted you a noble vine, wholly a true seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate [shoots of] an alien vine to Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though you wash yourself with potash, and multiply soap for yourself, [yet] your iniquity is marked before Me, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How can you say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals? See your way in the valley, know what you have done! [You are] a swift camel crossing its ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>a wild ass used to the wilderness; in the desire of her passion she snuffs at the wind; [in] her time who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not tire themselves; in her month they will find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Withhold your foot from [being] bare, and your throat from thirst. But you said, There is no hope; no; for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>saying to a tree, You [are] my father; and to a stone, You gave [me] birth. For they have turned [their] back to Me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise and save us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where [are] your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble; for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why will you plead with Me? You all have sinned against Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In vain I have stricken your sons; they received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O generation, see the Word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of darkness? Why do My people say, We roam [freely]; we will come no more to You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, [or] a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Why did you trim your way to seek love? Therefore you have also taught the evil women your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; you did not find them breaking in, but on all these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Why do you go about so much to change your way? You also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yes, you shall go out from this [place], and your hands on your head. For the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
