And Jeremiah the prophet was shut in the court of the guard, which [was] in the king of Judah's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, So says the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and he shall lead Zedekiah into Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says the LORD; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jeremiah said, The Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth; for the right to redeem it [is] yours, to buy [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD and said to me, Please buy my field in Anathoth, which [is] in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance [is] yours, and the right to redeem [is] yours. Buy [it] for yourself. Then I knew that this [was] the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I bought the field in Anathoth, of Hanameel my uncle's son, and weighed him the silver, seventeen shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I wrote it in the document, and sealed [it], and called witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I took the document of the purchase, that which was sealed [according] to the law and custom, and the open copy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I gave the document of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel my uncle's [son], and before the eyes of the witnesses who wrote in the purchase document, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I commanded Baruch before them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these books, the purchase document, the one sealed and the open book, and put them in an earthen vessel so that they may stand many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For so says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be owned again in this land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And after I gave the purchase document to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ah, Lord Jehovah! You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and stretched out arm. Nothing is too great for You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You show loving-kindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them. The great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts, [is] His name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>great in wisdom and mighty in work; for Your eyes [are] open on all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, until this day, and in Israel, and among men; and have made You a name, as at this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and have brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And You have given them this land, which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came in and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice, nor did they walk in Your law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to come on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, the siege mounds have come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the plague. And what You have spoken has happened; and, behold, You saw [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And You have said to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the Word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore so says the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come up and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have only done evil before Me from their youth. For the sons of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this city has been to Me as a cause of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before My face</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger, they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they have turned the back to Me, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching [them], yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they built the high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And now therefore, so says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath. And I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for their good and for the good of their sons after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will cut an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good. But I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will truly plant them in this land with all My heart and all My whole soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For so says the LORD: As I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, [It is] a desert without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Men shall buy fields for silver, and write it in a book, and seal [it], and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south. For I will cause their captivity to return, says the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
