For they [are] all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they bend their tongues [like] their bow [for] lies. But they are not mighty for the truth on the earth; for they go from evil to evil, and they do not know Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone beware of his neighbor, and do not trust any brother! For every brother will supplant his neighbor, and will walk with slanders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And everyone will deceive his neighbor and will not speak the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak lies, [and] they weary themselves to commit iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your dwelling [is] in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore so says Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will melt them and try them; for what [else] can I do for the daughter of My people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their tongue [is] a slaughtering arrow; it speaks deceit; [one] speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in heart he lies in ambush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I not visit them for these [things]? says the LORD; shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I will take up a weeping and a wailing for the mountains, and a mourning for the pastures of the wilderness; because they are burned up, so that none can pass through [them]; nor can men hear the voice of the cattle. Both the birds of the heavens and the beast have fled; they are gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make Jerusalem ruins, a den of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without a living soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who [is] the wise man who may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it? Why does the land perish [and] burn up like a wilderness, so that none passes through?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD says, Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, and have not walked in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but they have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore so says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and make them drink poisonous water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will also scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. And I will send a sword after them until I have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So says the LORD of hosts, Think carefully, and call for the wailers, that they may come. And send for the wise women, that they may come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and let them make haste and take up a weeping for us, so that our eyes may run down with tears, and waters flow [from] our eyelids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For a voice of weeping is heard out of Zion. How are we plundered! We are greatly ashamed, because we have forsaken the land, because they have thrown down our tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet hear the Word of the LORD, O women, and let your ear receive the word of His mouth, and teach your daughters to weep, and each one teach her neighbor to mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For death has come up into our windows, [and] has entered into our houses, to cut off the children from outside [and] the young men from the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Speak, So says the LORD, Even the bodies of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the fallen grain after the reaper; and none shall gather [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So says the LORD, Do not let the wise glory in his wisdom, nor let the mighty glory in his might; do not let the rich glory in his riches;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I [am] the LORD, doing kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth; for in these I delight, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will punish all the circumcised with foreskin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and all [who are] in the outermost corners, who dwell in the wilderness. For all [these] nations are not circumcised, and all the house of Israel, those not circumcised in heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
