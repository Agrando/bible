For in the day of trouble they shall be against her all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do not let the treader fully tread his bow; nor lift himself up in his armor. And do not spare her young men; utterly destroy all her army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the dead shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, [those] thrust through in her streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For neither Israel nor Judah [has been] forsaken by his God, by Jehovah of hosts, though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and each man deliver his soul. Be not cut off in her iniquity, for this [is] the time of the LORD's vengeance; He will give to her a just reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Babylon [has been] a golden cup in the LORD's hand, which made all the earth drunk. The nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed. Wail for her; take balm for her pain, if perhaps she may be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. Forsake her and let us go, each one into his own country; for her judgment reaches to the heavens and is lifted up to the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The LORD has brought forth our righteousness; come and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sharpen the arrows; gather the shields; the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes. For His plan [is] against Babylon, to destroy [it]; because it [is] the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of His temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Set up the banner on the walls of Babylon; make the watch strong; set up the watchmen; prepare the ambushes. For the LORD has both planned and done that which He spoke against the people of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O you who live on many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, [and] the measure of your unjust gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah of hosts has sworn by Himself, [saying], Surely I will fill you with men as with locusts; and they shall lift up a shout against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When He utters [His] voice, [there is] a multitude of waters in the heavens; and He causes the mists to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings with rain and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every man is brutish in knowledge; every refiner is put to shame by idols. For his molded image [is] a lie, and no breath [is] in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They [are] vanity, the work of errors; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Portion of Jacob [is] not like them; for He [is] the Former of all things, and [Israel is] the rod of His inheritance. Jehovah of hosts [is] His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You [are] My war-club [and] weapons of war; for with you I will shatter nations; and with you I will destroy kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And with you I will shatter the horse and his rider; and with you I will shatter the chariot and his rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also with you I will shatter man and woman; and with you I will shatter old and young; and with you I will shatter the young man and the girl.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will also shatter the shepherd and his flock with you. And with you I will shatter the farmer and his team; and with you I will shatter heads and rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will give to Babylon, and to all the people of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, I [am] against you, O destroying mountain, says the LORD, who destroys all the earth. And I will stretch out My hand on you and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burned mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall not take a stone from you for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be a waste forever, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Set up a banner in the land; blow a trumpet among the nations; prepare the nations against her. Call the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz together against her; set a commander against her. Cause the horses to come up as the rough locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Consecrate nations against her, with the kings of the Medes, her governors and all her rulers, and all the land of his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the land shall tremble and writhe. For every purpose of the LORD shall be done against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desert without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting; they have remained in strongholds; their might has failed. They became like women; they have burned her houses; her bars are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>A runner shall run to meet a runner, and a herald to a herald, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city is captured from end [to end] ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and that the fords are stopped. And they have burned the reeds with fire, and the men of war are frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For so says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon [is] like a threshing floor; [it is] time to thresh her. Yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel. He has swallowed me up like a jackal; he has filled his belly with good things; he has thrown me out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the violence done to me and to my flesh [shall be] on Babylon; the dweller in Zion shall say. And, My blood [shall be] on the people of Chaldea, Jerusalem shall say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the LORD says this: Behold, I will plead your cause and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Babylon shall become heaps, a home for jackals, a horror and a hissing, without an inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions' cubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk so that they may rejoice and sleep a never-ending sleep, and never awaken, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>How Sheshach is captured! And how the praise of the whole earth is seized! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Her cities are a desert, a dry land and a wilderness, a land in which no man dwells, nor does [any] son of man pass by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up. And the nations shall not flow together any more to him; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>My people, go out of her midst; and let each man deliver his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And let not your heart faint, nor fear the rumor that shall be heard in the land. The report [shall come] in a year. And after that a report [shall come] in [another] year; and violence  shall be] in the land, ruler against ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So, behold, the days come that I will punish the idols of Babylon. And all her land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in her midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the heavens and the earth, and all that [is] in them, shall shout for Babylon; for the plunderers shall come to her from the north, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>As Babylon is to fall for the dead of Israel, so at Babylon the dead of all the earth shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>You who have escaped the sword, go away; do not stand still. Remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>We have turned pale because we have heard reproach; shame has covered our faces, for foreigners have come into the holy places of the LORD's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>So, behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, that I will punish her idols, and through all her land the wounded shall groan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, [yet] plunderers shall come to her from Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>A sound of a cry [comes] from Babylon, and great ruin from the land of the Chaldeans,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>because the LORD is stripping Babylon, and the great voice will perish out of her. And her waves will roar like great waters; the noise of their voice is given,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>because the ravager has come on her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are captured. Every one of their bows is broken, for Jehovah, God of vengeance, shall surely repay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And I will make her rulers drunk, also her wise ones, her governors, and her rulers, and her mighty men. And they shall sleep a never-ending sleep and not awaken, says the King whose name [is] Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>So says Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be completely broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labor in vain, and the people shall be in the fire, and they shall be weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah [into] Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And Seraiah [was] a quiet prince.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, and shall see and shall read all these words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>then you shall say, O LORD, You have spoken against this place to cut it off, so that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be a ruin forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And you shall say, In this way shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring on her. And they shall be weary. So far [are] the words of Jeremiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
