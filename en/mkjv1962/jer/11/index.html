Then I answered and said, Amen, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the LORD said to me, Declare all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I earnestly testified to your fathers in the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and testifying, saying, Obey My voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they did not obey nor bow down their ear, but walked each one in the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I will bring on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded [them] to do; but they did not do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said to me, A plot is found among the men of Judah, and among the people of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My words. And they went after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the LORD says this: Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to Me, I will not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall the cities of Judah and the people of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense. But they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For [according to] the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah. And [according to] the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to [that] shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them. For I will not hear [them] in the time they cry to Me for their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What [is to] My beloved in My house, [since] she has committed her many evils? And has the holy flesh caused your evil to pass from you? [How] then do you exult?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The LORD called your name, a green olive tree, fair, [with] fine fruit. With the sound of a great storm He has set fire to it, and its branches are worthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah of hosts who planted you has spoken evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves to provoke Me to anger by offering incense to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD made me know, and I knew. Then You showed me their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I [was] like a docile lamb being brought to the slaughter. And I did not know that they had plotted evils against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name may be remembered no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O Jehovah of hosts who judges rightly, who tries the heart and the mind, let me see Your vengeance on them. For to You I have revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore so says the LORD of the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, that you do not die by our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So says Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and there shall be no remnant of them. For I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, the year of their judgment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
