And if you will put away your abominations out of your sight, then you shall not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And you shall swear, The LORD lives, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him they shall glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For so says the LORD to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, men of Judah and people of Jerusalem; lest My fury come forth like fire, and burn so that none can put [it] out; because of the evil of your doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Declare in Judah, and let it be heard in Jerusalem; and say, Blow the trumpet in the land; cry, gather together, and say, Gather yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set up the banner toward Zion; flee for safety and do not wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lion has come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the nations has set out; he has left his place to make your land a waste. Your cities will fall into ruins without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Put on sackcloth for this, wail and howl; for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be at that day, says the LORD, the king's heart will perish, and the heart of the rulers; and the priests will be amazed, and the prophets will be astounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; but the sword reaches to the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind [from] the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of My people, not to sift nor to cleanse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A wind more full than these shall come for Me. Now also I will utter judgments against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, he shall come up like clouds, and his chariots like a tempest. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are plundered!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O Jerusalem, cleanse your heart from evil so that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims affliction from mount Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tell [it] to the nations: Behold! proclaim against Jerusalem! Besiegers are going to come from a distant land; and they will set their voice against the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Like watchmen of a field, they are against her all around; because she rebelled against Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your way and your doings have brought these [things] on you; this is your evil, because it is bitter, because it reaches to your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My bowels, my bowels! I convulse in pain. O walls of my heart! My heart is restless within me; I cannot be silent because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the ram's horn, the alarm of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ruin on ruin is cried; for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are laid waste, my curtains in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long shall I see the banner [and] hear the sound of the ram's horn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For My people [are] foolish; they have not known Me; they are stupid sons, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I looked on the earth, and, lo, [it was] without form and void; and the heavens, and they [had] no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I looked on the mountains, and, lo, they quaked; and all the hills were shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I looked, and, lo, [there was] no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I looked, and, lo, the fruitful place [was] a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down before the face of the LORD, before His fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For so the LORD has said, The whole land shall be desolate, yet I will not make a full end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The earth shall mourn for this, and the heavens above shall be black, because I have spoken, I have purposed, and will not repent, nor will I turn back from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Every city shall flee from the sound of the horsemen and bowmen. They shall go into thickets and climb up among the rocks. All the city is abandoned, and not a man shall live in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Though you dress with crimson, though you put on ornaments of gold, though you make your eyes large with paint, you shall make yourself beautiful in vain; your lovers will despise you; they will seek your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor, the anguish as one bearing her first child, the voice of Zion's daughter, gasping and spreading her hands, [saying], Woe to me now! For my soul faints because of murderers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
