And when the Chaldeans who besieged Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Word of the LORD came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So says the LORD, the God of Israel: You shall say this to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city, and capture it, and burn it with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So says the LORD: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us. For they shall not depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For though you had stricken the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained [only] wounded men among them, they would rise up, each man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened when the army of Chaldeans was made to go up from Jerusalem because of fear of Pharaoh's army,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive a portion from there in the midst of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened, he [being] in the gate of Benjamin, a commander of the guard named Irijah [was] there, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. And he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jeremiah said, A lie! I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he did not listen to him; so Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the rulers were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison, the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jeremiah had entered into the house of the pit, and into the cells, then Jeremiah remained there many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Zedekiah the king sent and took him out. And the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there [any] word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is. For, He said, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where now [are] your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you nor against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And please hear now, O my lord the king; I beg you, let my cry be pleasing to you, so that you cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Zedekiah the king commanded that they should put Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him a piece of bread out of the bakers' street daily, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
