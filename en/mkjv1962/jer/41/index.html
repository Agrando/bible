And there they ate bread together in Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened the second day after he had killed Gedaliah (and no one knew [it] ),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>some men from Shechem came from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, with their beards shaved, and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring [them] to the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he walked. And it happened as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it happened when they came into the middle of the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, he and the men with him, and they [threw them] into the middle of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, Do not kill us, for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he held back and did not kill them among their brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the pit in which Ishmael had thrown all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had killed because of Gedaliah, [was] the one which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who [were] in Mizpah, even the king's daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners had entrusted to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took captive and left to go over to the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah.

They took mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they departed and lived in the inn of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because of the Chaldeans.
