Would not that land be greatly defiled? But you play the harlot with many lovers; yet come back to Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Lift up your eyes to the high places, and see. Where have you not been lain with? By the highways you have sat for them, like the Arabian in the wilderness; and you have defiled the land with your fornications and with your wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a harlot's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will you not from this time cry to Me, My father, [You are] the guide of my youth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will He keep [His anger] forever? Will He keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done [all] the evil things you could do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The LORD also said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has fornicated there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I said after she had done all these [things], Turn to Me! But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I saw, when for all the causes [for] which backsliding Israel committed adultery, I sent her away and gave a bill of divorce to her, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she went and whored, she also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it happened, from the folly of her whoredom, she defiled the land and fornicated with stones and stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to Me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to me, The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go and cry these words toward the north, and say, Return, O backsliding Israel, says the LORD; [and] I will not cause My anger to fall on you; for I [am] merciful, says the LORD, [and] I will not keep anger forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have sinned against the LORD your God and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Turn, O backsliding sons, says the LORD; for I am married to you; and I will take you one from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you [with] knowledge and understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it will be when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD! Nor shall it come to mind; nor shall they remember it; nor shall they visit [it]; nor shall it be made any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem. Nor shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I said, How shall I put you among the sons, and give you a pleasant land, a beautiful inheritance [among] the hosts of nations? And I said, You shall call Me, My Father, and shall not turn away from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely [as] a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A voice was heard on the high places weeping, cryings of the sons of Israel; for they have perverted their way, [and] they have forgotten Jehovah their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Return, O backsliding sons, [and] I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to You; for You are Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly, for delusion [comes] from the high hills, tumult [on] the mountains. Truly, in Jehovah our God [is] the salvation of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For shame has eaten up the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
