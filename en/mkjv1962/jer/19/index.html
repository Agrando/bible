And there declare the words that I shall tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And say, Hear the Word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and people of Jerusalem. So says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which shall cause the ears of him who hears it to tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because they have forsaken Me, and have made this place [famous] and have burned incense in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They have also built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire [for] burnt offerings to Baal, which I never commanded nor spoke, nor did [it] come into My mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but, The Valley of Slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem come to nothing in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of those who seek their lives. And I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the animals of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will make this city a waste and a hissing. Everyone who passes by shall be amazed and shall hiss because of all its plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall each one eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress, with which their enemies and those who seek their lives shall distress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then you shall break the jar before the eyes of the men who go with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and shall say to them, So says the LORD of hosts, Even so I will break this people of this city, as [one] breaks a potter's vessel that cannot be made whole again. And they shall bury [them in Tophet until there is no place  left] to bury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will do this to this place, says the LORD, and to its people, and make this city as Tophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be as defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of the heavens, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jeremiah came from Tophet, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy. And he stood in the court of the LORD's house, and said to all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have spoken against it, because they have hardened their necks so that they might not hear My words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
