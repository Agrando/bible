They shall not be gathered nor buried; they shall be as dung on the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the rest of those who remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places where I have driven them, says Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And you shall say to them, So says the LORD; shall they fall and not arise? Shall he turn away and not return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why has this people of Jerusalem slidden back [by] a never-ending backsliding? They hold fast to deceit; they refuse to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I listened and heard, [but] they did not speak right; no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Everyone turned in their own courses, as the horse rushes into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yea, the stork in the heavens knows her seasons; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow watch the time of their coming; but my people do not know the judgment of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How do you say, We [are] wise, and the law of the LORD [is] with us? Lo, certainly the lying pen of the scribes has written falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The wise are ashamed, they are terrified, and are captured. Lo, they have turned away from the Word of the LORD; and what wisdom [is] in them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I will give their wives to others, [and] their fields to those who shall inherit [them], for everyone from the least even to the greatest cuts off a profit. From the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Were they ashamed when they had done an abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor could they blush; therefore they shall fall among those who fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will utterly consume them, says the LORD; [there shall be] no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them, [those who] pass over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why do we sit still? Gather yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there. For Jehovah our God has put us to silence, and has given us poisonous water to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We looked for peace, but no good [came]; [and] for a time of health, but behold, trouble!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his stallions. For they have come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those who live in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I will send serpents and adders among you, [which will] not [be] charmed; and they shall bite you, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[When] I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart [is] faint within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people, from a far country. [Is] not the LORD in Zion? [Is] not her King in her? Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, with foreign vanities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the breaking of the daughter of my people I am broken; I am in gloom; horror has seized me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[Is there] no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the healing of the daughter of My people not come?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
