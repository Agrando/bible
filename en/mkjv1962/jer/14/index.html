They are black to the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem has gone up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters; they came to the cisterns, [and] found no water. They returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because the ground was cracked, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed; they covered their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yea, the doe also calved in the field and forsook [it], because [there was] no grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the wild asses stood in the high places; they snuffed up the wind like jackals; their eyes failed because [there was] no grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, act for Your name's sake; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O the Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of trouble, why should You be as a stranger in the land, and as a traveler turning in to lodge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Why should You be as a man stunned, as one mighty, [yet] who cannot save? Yet You, O LORD, [are] in our midst, and we are called by Your name. Do not leave us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So says the LORD to this people; So they have loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet; therefore the LORD does not accept them. He will now remember their iniquity and visit their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the LORD said to me, Do not pray for this people for good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and a grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I said, Ah, O Lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets are saying to them, You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine; but I will give you true peace in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I did not send them, nor have I commanded them, nor did I speak to them. They prophesy to you a false vision and a worthless divination, and a thing of no value, and the deceit of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the LORD says this concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, and I did not send them; yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; by sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, [either] them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. For I will pour their evil on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall speak this word to them: Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and do not let them cease. For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great break, [with] a very grievous blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go out into the field, then I see those killed with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then, behold, sicknesses of famine! Yes, both the prophet and the priest have gone up into a land that they do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have You utterly rejected Judah? Or has Your soul hated Zion? Why have You stricken us, and [there is] no healing for us? [We] looked for peace, but no good [came]; and for the time of healing, and behold, trouble!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not abhor [us] for Your name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of Your glory; remember, do not break Your covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there [any] among the vanities of the nations who make rain fall? Or can the heavens give showers? [Is] it not You, O LORD our God? Then we will wait on You; for You do all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
