And your eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet hear the Word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah: So says the LORD of you, You shall not die by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You shall die in peace; and as the burnings of spices [for] your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so they shall burn [spices] for you. And they will mourn you, saying, Ah, lord! For I have spoken the word, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>when the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah; against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after king Zedekiah had cut a covenant with all the people at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that each man should let his male slave, and each man his female slave, [if] a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, to go free, that none should enslave a Jew, his brother among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the rulers obeyed, and all the people who had entered into the covenant allowed them to go free, each man his male slave, and each man his female slave, so that not any should enslave among them any more; and they obeyed and let  them] go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But afterward they turned and caused the slaves and slave women whom they had let go free, to return! And they subjected them for slaves and slave women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the Word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So says the LORD, the God of Israel: I cut a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At the end of seven years each man should let go his brother, a Hebrew, and who has been sold to him. And when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you. But your fathers did not listen to me, nor bow down their ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you had turned today, and had done right in My sight to call for liberty, each man to his neighbor. And you had cut a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But you turned and defiled My name, and each man caused his slave, and each man caused his slave woman, whom you had set free to do as they pleased, to return. And you brought them into service to be slaves and slave women to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the LORD says this: You have not listened to Me to proclaim liberty each man to his brother, and each man to his neighbor! Behold, I call for freedom for you, says the LORD, to the sword, to the plague, and to the famine. And I will cause you to be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will give the men who have sinned against My covenant, who have not done the words of the covenant which they cut before Me [when they] cut the calf in two and passed between its parts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the rulers of Judah, and the rulers of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his rulers, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, who have withdrawn from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I will command, says the LORD, and cause them to return to this city. And they shall fight against it and capture it, and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Judah a desert without a soul to live in it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
