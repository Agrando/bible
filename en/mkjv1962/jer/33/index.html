And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the riches that I bring to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So says the LORD: Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say [is] a waste without man and without beast, [even] in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts, for the LORD [is] good, for His mercy [endures] forever; and the voice of those who shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return, as at the first, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So says the LORD of hosts: Again in this place which is a desert without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there [shall be] a home of shepherds causing [their] flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him who tallies, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will establish the good thing which I have spoken to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, I will cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David. And He shall do judgment and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this [is the name] with which she shall be called, JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For so says the LORD, David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>nor shall the priests the Levites lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle grain offerings, and to do sacrifice forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So says the LORD: If you can break My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[then] also may My covenant with David My servant be broken, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne, and [My covenant] with the Levites the priests, My ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do you not consider what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD has chosen, He has even cast them off? So they have despised My people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So says the LORD: If My covenant [is] not with day and night, [and if] I have not given the ordinances of the heavens and the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then I will cast away the seed of Jacob, and David My servant, [so] that I will not take [any] of his seed [to be] rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will bring back their captivity, and have mercy on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
