You have stricken them, but they have not grieved; You have destroyed them, but they have refused to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So I said, Surely these [are] poor; they are foolish; for they do not know the way of the LORD, [nor] the judgment of their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will go up for myself to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the LORD [and] the judgment of their God. But these have broken the yoke together and have torn off the bonds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, [and] a wolf of the deserts shall rob them; a leopard shall watch over their cities. Everyone who goes out from them shall be torn in pieces, because their sins are many [and] their backslidings are multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why shall I pardon you for this? Your sons have forsaken Me, and have sworn by No-gods. When I adjured them, then they committed adultery, and gathered themselves by troops in a harlot's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They were [like] lusty, well-fed stallions in the morning; every one neighing after his neighbor's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I not judge for these [things]? says the LORD. And shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go up on her vine-rows and destroy; but do not make a full end; take away her branches, for they [are] not the LORD's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very deceitfully against Me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have lied against the LORD and said, [It is] not He; neither shall evil come on us; nor shall we see sword nor famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the prophets shall become wind, and the word [is] not in them; so it shall be done to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore so says Jehovah, God of hosts, Because you spoke this word, behold, I will make My words in your mouth fire, and these people wood, and it shall devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lo, I will bring a nation on you from afar, O house of Israel, says the LORD. It [is] an enduring nation, it [is] an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor understand what they say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Their quiver [is] as an open grave; they [are] all mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they shall eat up Your harvest and your bread. They will devour your sons and your daughters. They shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig-trees. One shall beat down your fortified cities with the sword, those in which you trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But even in those days, says Jehovah, I will not make a complete end with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it will be, when you shall say, Why does the LORD our God do all these things] to us? Then You shall answer them, Just as you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is] not yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Declare this in the house of Jacob, and cry it in Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now hear this, O foolish people and without heart; who have eyes and see not; who have ears and hear not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you not fear Me? says the LORD. Will you not tremble at My presence, I who have placed the sand [for] the boundary of the sea [by] a never-ending decree, so that it cannot pass it? And though they toss themselves, yet they cannot prevail; though its waves roar, yet they cannot pass over it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they have revolted and are gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they do not say in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, who gives both the former and the latter rain in its season; He reserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your iniquities have turned away these [things], and your sins have withheld good from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For among My people are found wicked ones; they lie in wait, as one who sets snares; they set a trap, they catch men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit; therefore they have become great and grown rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They have become fat, they shine. Yes, they go past the deeds of the wicked; they do not judge the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may get rich; and they do not judge the right of the needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Shall I not visit for these [things]? says the LORD. Shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>An astounding and horrible thing has happened in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love [to have it] so, and what will you do at the end of it?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
