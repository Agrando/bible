And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest. And offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Jesus had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, beseeching Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and saying, Lord, my son lies at home paralyzed and grievously tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus says to him, I will come and heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my boy will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go! And he goes; and to another, Come! And he comes; and to my servant, Do this! And he does [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard, He marvelled and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found such [great] faith, no, not in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus said to the centurion, Go. And as you have believed, [so] let it be to you. And his boy was healed in that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's mother laid out and in a fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And evening coming on, they brought to Him many who had been possessed with demons. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, He took [on Himself] our weaknesses and bore [our] sicknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And seeing great crowds, Jesus gave orders to depart to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a certain scribe came and said to him, Master, I will follow You wherever You go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air [have] nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay [His] head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And another of His disciples said to him, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He entering into a boat, His disciples followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold, a great tempest arose in the sea, so much so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And His disciples came to [Him] and awakened Him, saying, Lord, save us! We perish!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He said to them, Why are you afraid, little-faiths? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the men marveled, saying, What kind [of man] is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when He had come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, two demon-possessed ones met Him, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one might pass by that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And behold, they cried out, saying, What [have] we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine, feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the demons begged Him, saying, If You cast us out, allow us to go away into the herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He said to them, Go! And when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those who fed [them] fled. And going into the city, [they] told everything, and what had happened to the ones who had been possessed of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged that He would depart out of their borders.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
