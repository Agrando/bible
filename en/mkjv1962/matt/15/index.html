For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother; and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him die by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say, Whoever says to [his] father or mother, Whatever you would gain from me, [It is] a gift to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and in no way he honors his father or his mother. And you voided the commandment of God by your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people draws near to Me with their mouth, and honors Me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vain they worship Me, teaching [for] doctrines [the] commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He called the crowd and said to them, Hear and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then His disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus said, Are you also still without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not yet understand that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into [the] waste-bowl?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>these are [the things] which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And going out from there, Jesus withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, a woman of Canaan coming out of these borders cried to Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and begged Him, saying, Send her away, for she cries after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But He answered and said, I am not sent except to the lost sheep of [the] house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, Lord, help me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children's bread and to throw [it] to dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And she said, True, O Lord; but even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great [is] your faith! So be it to you even as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And moving from there Jesus came beside the Sea of Galilee. And He went up into a mountain and sat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others. And they cast them down at Jesus' feet. And He healed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so much so that the crowd wondered when they saw the dumb speak, the maimed sound, the lame walk, and the blind see. And they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus called His disciples and said, I have compassion on the crowd because they continue with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat. And I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And His disciples said to Him, From where should we [get] so many loaves in the wilderness, so as to fill so great a crowd?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few little fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And He commanded the crowd to sit on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to His disciples. And the disciples gave to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all ate, and were filled; and they took up seven lunch baskets full of the pieces that was left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And sending the crowd away, He went into the boat and came into the borders of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
