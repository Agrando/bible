And they said, What [is that] to us? You see [to that].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he threw the pieces of silver down in the temple and departed. And he went and hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is [the] price of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they took counsel and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore that field was called, The Field of Blood, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who had been priced, whom they of the children of Israel valued,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate said to Him, Do you not hear how many things they witness against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He did not answer him a word, so that the governor greatly marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now at [that] feast the governor was accustomed to release to the people a prisoner, whomever they desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they then had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you desire that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus [who is] called Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he knew they had delivered Him because of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But as he was sitting down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just man, for today because of Him I have suffered many things in a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd that they should ask [for] Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you desire that I release [to] you? They said, Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? [They] all said to him, Let Him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the governor said, Why? What evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, let Him be crucified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when Pilate saw that it gained nothing, but rather [that] a tumult was made, he took water and washed [his] hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person. You see to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then all the people answered and said, Let His blood [be] on us and on our children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released Barabbas to them. And when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered [Him] to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then taking Jesus into the praetorium, the soldiers of the governor gathered the cohort against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And stripping Him, they put a scarlet robe around Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And plaiting a crown of thorns, they put [it] on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And spitting at Him, [they] took the reed and struck at His head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after they had mocked Him, they took the robe off of Him and put His own clothing on Him and led Him away to crucify [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They forced this one to carry His cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And coming to a place called Golgotha, which is called, Place of a Skull,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. And when He had tasted, He would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they crucified Him, dividing His garments, casting a lot; so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted My garments among them, and they cast a lot for My clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And sitting down they guarded Him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they put up over His head His accusation, written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then two thieves were crucified with Him, one off [the] right, one off [the] left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, shaking their heads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and saying, [You] destroying the temple and building [it] in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And in the same way also the chief priests mocked, with the scribes and elders, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusted in God, let Him deliver him now, if He will have him. (For He said, I am [the] Son of God.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And also the thieves who were crucified with Him reviled Him, [saying] the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And from [the] sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until [the] ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Some of those who stood there, when they heard, said, This one calls for Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar, and he put [it] on a reed and gave it to Him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The rest said, Let Him alone, let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And crying again with a loud voice, Jesus released [His] spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, behold! The veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were sheared,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and coming out of the tomb after His resurrection [they] went into the holy city and appeared to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But the centurion and those guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake, and the things that took place, [they] feared greatly, saying, Truly this One was Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And many of the women were there, watching from a distance, [those] who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, watching from a distance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>When the evening had come, a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, came, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>He went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in clean linen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and laid it in his new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, were sitting there across from the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And on the next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He was living, After three days I will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Then command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say to the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last error will be worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate said to them, You have a watch. Go and make [it] as secure as you can.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And going they made the tomb secure, sealing the stone along with the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
