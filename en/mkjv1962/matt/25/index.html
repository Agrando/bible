Go out to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the foolish said to the wise, Give us [some] of your oil, for our lamps have gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise answered, saying, [No], lest there be not enough for us and you. But rather go to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. And they who were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterwards the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore watch, for you do not know either the day or the hour in which the Son of man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For [it is] as if a man going abroad called [his] own servants and gave them his goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his ability. And he went abroad at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And going he who had received the five talents traded with them, and made another five talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And likewise he who [had received] two, he also gained another two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the earth and hid his lord's silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After a long time the lord of those servants came and took account with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so he who had received five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered five talents to me. Behold, I have gained five talents above them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His lord said to him, Well [done], good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will [make] you [ruler] over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He also who had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered two talents to me. Behold, I have gained two other talents above them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His lord said to him, Well [done], good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will [make] you [ruler] over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew that you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I was afraid and went and hid your talent in the earth. Lo, you have yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>His lord answered and said to him, Evil and slothful servant! You knew that I reaped where I did not sow, and gathered where I did not scatter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then you should have put my money to the exchangers, and coming I would have received my own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore take the talent from him and give [it] to him who has ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to everyone who has, [more] shall be given, and he will abound. But from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And throw the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But when the Son of man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He shall sit on the throne of His glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And all nations shall be gathered before Him. And He shall separate them from one another, as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And indeed [He] shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats off the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the King shall say to those on His right [hand], Come, blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from [the] foundation of [the] world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the righteous shall answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry, and fed [You]? Or thirsty, and gave [You] drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see You a stranger, and took [You] in? Or naked, and clothed [You] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and came to You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did [it] to one of the least of these My brothers, you have done [it] to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then He also shall say to those on [the] left [hand], Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I was hungry, and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me no drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger and you did not take Me in; I was naked, and you did not clothe Me; I was sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then they will also answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then He shall answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did not do [it] to one of the least of these, you did not do [it] to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
