For it is necessary that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if your hand or your foot causes you to offend, cut them off and throw [them] from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if your eye offends you, pluck it out and throw [it] from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take heed [that] you do not despise one of these little [ones]. For I say to you that in Heaven their angels always behold the face of My Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays, does he not leave the ninety and nine [and] go into the mountains and seek the straying one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if it happens that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety and nine which did not stray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so it is not [the] will of your Father in Heaven that one of these little [ones] should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he will not hear [you], take one or two more with you, so that in [the] mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell [it] to the church. But if he neglects to hear the church, let him be to you as a heathen and a tax-collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall occur, having been bound in Heaven; and whatever you shall loose on earth shall occur, having been loosed in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as regarding anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by My Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter came to Him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Until seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore the kingdom of Heaven has been compared to a certain king who desired to make an accounting with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had begun to count, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as he had nothing to pay, his lord commanded that he, and his wife and children, and all that he had, be sold, and payment be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the servant fell down and worshiped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me and I will pay you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And he laid hands on him and took [him] by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, Have patience with me and I will pay you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry. And they came and told their lord all that was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord, after he had called him, said to him, O wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Should you not also have pitied your fellow servant, even as I had pity on you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also to you, unless each one of you from your hearts forgive his brother their trespasses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
