And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Child, be of good cheer. Your sins are forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And lo, some of the scribes said within themselves, This one blasphemes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For which is easier? To say, [Your] sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise and walk!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, then He said to the paralytic, Arise, take up your bed and go to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he arose and departed to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But when the crowds saw, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax-office. And He said to him, Follow Me! And he arose and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened as Jesus reclined in the house, behold, many tax-collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Him and His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the Pharisees saw, they said to His disciples, Why does your master eat with tax-collectors and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Jesus heard, He said to them, The ones who are whole do not need a physician, but the ones who are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But go and learn what [this is], I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the disciples of John came to Him saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No one puts a piece of new cloth onto an old garment; for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor do men put new wine into old wineskins; else the wineskins burst, and the wine runs out, and the wineskins perish. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While He spoke these things to them, behold, a certain ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, My daughter has just now died. But come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus arose and followed him. And [so did] His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, a woman, who had a flow of blood for twelve years, came up behind [Him] and touched the hem of His garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she said within herself, If only I shall touch His robe, I will be whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But turning and seeing her, Jesus said, Daughter, be comforted; your faith has saved you. And the woman was saved from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said to them, Go back, for the little girl is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed Him to scorn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the people were put out, He went in and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And this report went out into all that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Jesus passed on from there, two blind ones followed Him, crying and saying, Son of David, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith let it be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See, let no one know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But going out, they made Him known in all that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a dumb man, who had been demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the demon had been cast out, the dumb one spoke. And multitudes marveled, saying, Never was it seen like this in Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees said, He throws out demons by the ruler of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion on them, because they were tired and scattered like sheep having no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then He said to His disciples, The harvest truly [is] plenteous, but the laborers are few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest that He will send out laborers into His harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
