For coming down from Heaven, and coming up, an angel of [the] Lord rolled back the stone from the door and [was] sitting on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the keepers shook for fear of him and became like dead [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not fear, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here, for He has risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead. And, behold, He goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see Him. Lo, I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they quickly departed from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But as they were going to report to His disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, Hail! And they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid; go tell My brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and declared all the things that were done to the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And being assembled with the elders, and taking counsel, [they] gave enough silver to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, Say that His disciples came by night [and] stole Him [away] while we slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free from care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And taking the silver, they did as they were taught. And this saying was spread among the Jews until today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw Him, they worshiped Him. But some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority is given to Me in Heaven and in earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you. And, behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the world. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
