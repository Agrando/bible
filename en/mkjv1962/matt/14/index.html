He has risen from the dead, and therefore the powerful works [are] working in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Herod had laid hold on John, and had bound him, and had put [him] in prison because of Herodias his brother Philip's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he desired to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And she, being instructed before by her mother, said, Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king was sorry. But for the oath's sake, and those reclining with [him], he commanded [it] to be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl. And she brought [it] to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his disciples came and took up the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus heard, He departed from there by boat into a deserted place apart. And hearing, the crowds followed Him on foot out of the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus went out and saw a great crowd, and He was moved with compassion toward them. And He healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And evening coming on, His disciples came to Him, saying, The place is deserted and the time has already gone by. Send the crowd away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them, They do not need to leave, you give them [something] to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they said to Him, We have here only five loaves and two fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said, Bring them here to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He commanded the crowd to recline on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to Heaven He blessed and broke, and gave the loaves to [His] disciples. And the disciples [gave] to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all ate and were filled. And they took up twelve hand baskets full from the fragments that remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And immediately Jesus constrained His disciples to get into a boat and to go before Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when He had sent the crowds away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray. And when evening had come, He was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat was now in [the] midst of the sea, tossed with waves; for the wind was against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a phantom! And they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer, I AM! Do not fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter answered Him and said, LORD, if it is You, tell me to come to You on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But seeing that the wind was strong, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately Jesus stretched out [His] hand and caught him; and said to him, Little-faith! Why did you doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they had come into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when they had passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And recognizing Him, the men of that place sent to all that neighborhood, and brought to Him all who were diseased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And [they] begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His robe. And as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
