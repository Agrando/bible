And they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he went out about [the] sixth and ninth hour and did likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here all day idle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and you shall receive whatever is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and pay them [their] wage, beginning from the last to the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when they [who were hired about] the eleventh hour came, they each one received a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when the first came, they supposed that they would received more; and they also each one received a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And receiving [it] they murmured against the master of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, These last have worked [only] one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and heat of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take yours, and go; I will give to this last one the same as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own? Is your eye evil because I am good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the last shall be first, and the first last, for many are called, but few are chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem. And the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they shall deliver Him to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of Zebedee's children came to Him with her sons, worshiping and desiring a certain thing from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He said to her, What do you desire? She said to Him, Grant that these my two sons may sit in Your kingdom, the one on Your right hand and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus answered and said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They said to Him, We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He said to them, You shall indeed drink of My cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but [to those] for whom it has been prepared by My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the ten heard [it], they were indignant concerning the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them and said, You know that the rulers of the nations exercise dominion over them, and they who are great exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>However, it shall not be so among you. But whoever desires to be great among you, let him be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever desires to be chief among you, let him be your servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>even as the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as they departed from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, two blind men were sitting by the wayside. When they heard that Jesus passed by, they cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the crowd rebuked them, saying that they should be silent. But they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus stood still and called them, and said, What do you desire that I should do to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jesus had compassion [on them] and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
