And His disciples came to [Him] to show Him the buildings of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jesus said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another that shall not be thrown down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? And what [shall be] the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in My name, saying, I am Christ, and will deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for all [these things] must occur; but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in different places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All these [are] the beginning of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they will deliver you up to be afflicted and will kill you. And you will be hated of all nations for My name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And then many will be offended, and will betray one another, and will hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And many false prophets will rise and deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many will become cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who endures to [the] end, the same shall be kept safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in all the world as a witness to all nations. And then the end shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoever reads, let him understand).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then let those in Judea flee into the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let him on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>nor let him in the field turn back to take his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And woe to those who are with child, and to those who give suck in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But pray that your flight is not in the winter, nor on the sabbath day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for then shall be great tribulation, such as has not been since [the] beginning of [the] world to this time; no, nor ever shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And unless those days should be shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect's sake, those days shall be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ! Or, There! Do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders; so much so that, if [it were] possible, they would deceive even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, I have told you beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore if they shall say to you, Behold, [He is] in the desert! Do not go out. Behold, [He is] in the secret rooms! Do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as the lightning comes out of [the] east and shines even to [the] west, so also will be the coming of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then the sign of the Son of man shall appear in the heavens. And then all the tribes of the earth shall mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of the heaven with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of [the] heavens to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now learn a parable of the fig tree. When its branch is still tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer [is] near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So you, likewise, when you see all these things, shall know that it is near, [at] the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass until all these things are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But of that day and hour no one knows, no, not the angels of Heaven, but only My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But as the days of Noah [were], so shall be the coming of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until [the] day Noah entered into the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they did not know until the flood came and took them all away. So also will be the coming of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then two shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore watch; for you do not know what hour your Lord comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But know this, that if the steward of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be dug through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Therefore you also be ready, for in that hour you think not, the Son of man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord has made ruler over His household, to give them food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed [is] that servant whom his Lord shall find him doing so when He comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly I say to you that He shall make him ruler over all His goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delays His coming,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and shall begin to strike [his] fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he does not look for [Him], and in an hour which he does not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He shall cut him apart and appoint [him] his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
