And all the crowd stood on the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth. And they sprang up immediately, because they [had] no deepness of earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And [the] sun rising, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some fell among thorns. And the thorns sprung up and choked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And some fell on the good ground and yielded fruit, indeed one a hundredfold, and one sixty, and one thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the disciples said to Him, Why do You speak to them in parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance. But whoever does not have, from him shall be taken away even that which he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not; nor do they understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which said, By hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for this people's heart has become gross, and [their] ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes, lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with [their ears and should understand with [their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear what you hear, and have not heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear the parable of the sower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When anyone hears the Word of the kingdom and does not understand [it,] then the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown by the wayside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But that which was sown on the stony places is this: he who hears the Word and immediately receives it with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he has no root in himself, and is temporary. For when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, he immediately stumbles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And that sown into the thorns is this: he who hears the Word; and the anxiety of this world, and the deceit of riches, choke the Word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But that sown on the good ground is this: he who hears the Word and understands; who also bears fruit and produces one truly a hundredfold; and one sixty; and one thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He put out another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel among the wheat and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the blade had sprung up and had produced fruit, then the darnel also appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then where have the darnel come from?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, No, lest while you gather up the darnel you also root up the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both grow together until the harvest. And in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather together the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my granary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He put out another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then sending the crowds away, Jesus went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said to them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The enemy who sowed them is the Devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore as the darnel are gathered and burned in the fire, so it shall be in the end of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man shall send out His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who do iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and shall cast them into a furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the righteous shall shine out like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which when a man has found it, he hides it, and for the joy of it goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered some of every kind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So it shall be at the end of the world. The angels shall come out and separate the wicked from among the just,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and shall cast them into the furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then He said to them, Therefore every scribe [who is] instructed to the kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out [things] new and old out of his treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it happened when Jesus finished these parables, He departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when He had come into His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so much so that they were astonished and said, From where does this [man have] this wisdom and these mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter's son? [Is] not his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and his sisters, are they not all with us? Then from where does this [man have] all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were offended in Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
