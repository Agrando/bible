And his food was locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jerusalem and all Judea went out to him, and all the region round about Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as [our] father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now also, the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. But He who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He shall baptize you with [the] Holy Spirit and [with] fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>whose fan [is] in His hand, and He will cleanse His floor and gather His wheat into the storehouse; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus came from Galilee to Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But John restrained Him, saying, I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And answering Jesus said to him, Allow [it] now, for it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus, when He had been baptized, went up immediately out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And lo, a voice from Heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
