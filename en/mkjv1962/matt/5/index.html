And when He had sat down, His disciples came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And He opened His mouth and taught them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed [are] the poor in spirit! For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed [are] they that mourn! For they shall be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Blessed [are] the meek! For they shall inherit the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed [are] they who hunger and thirst after righteousness! For they shall be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed [are] the merciful! For they shall obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed [are] the pure in heart! For they shall see God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Blessed [are] the peacemakers! For they shall be called the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed [are] they who have been persecuted for righteousness sake! For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Blessed are you when [men] shall revile you and persecute [you], and shall say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for My sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward in Heaven [is] great. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its savor, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything, but to be thrown out and to be trodden underfoot by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor do men light a lamp and put it under the grain-measure, but on a lampstand. And it gives light to all who are in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly I say to you, Till the heaven and the earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall in any way pass from the law until all is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore whoever shall break one of these commandments, the least, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of Heaven. But whoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say to you that unless your righteousness shall exceed [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not kill --and, Whoever shall kill shall be liable to the judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be liable to the judgment. And whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the sanhedrin; but whoever shall say, Fool! shall be liable [to be thrown] into the fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if you offer your gift on the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him; that the opponent not deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you have paid the last kodrantes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you that whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if your right eye offends you, pluck it out and throw [it] from you. For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not [that] your whole body should be thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand offends you, cut it off and throw [it] from you. For it is profitable for you [that] one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It was also said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you that whoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever shall marry her who is put away commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Again, you have heard that it has been said to the ancients, You shall not swear falsely, but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say to you, Do not swear at all! Not by Heaven, because it is God's throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>not by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; not by Jerusalem, because it is [the] city of the great King;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no. For whatever is more than these comes from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say to you, Do not resist evil. But whoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And to him desiring to sue you, and to take away your tunic, let him have [your] coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him who asks of you, and you shall not turn away from him who would borrow from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>so that you may become sons of your Father in Heaven. For He makes His sun to rise on [the] evil and on [the] good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax-collectors do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you greet your brothers only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax-collectors do so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Therefore be perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
