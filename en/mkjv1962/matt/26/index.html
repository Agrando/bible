For she has done a good work on Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For in putting ointment on My body, she did [it] for My burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be proclaimed in the whole world, that which this woman has done shall be spoken of also, for a memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said [to them], What will you give me, and I will betray Him to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And on the first [day] of the [Feast of] Unleavened [Bread], the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, Where do You desire that we prepare for You to eat the Passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them. And they made the passover ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when evening had come, He sat down with the Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as they ate, He said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And grieving sorrowfully, they began to say, each one of them, Lord, not I am [the one] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He answered and said, He who dips [his] hand with Me in the dish, the same shall betray Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of man goes, as it has been written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And answering, the [one] betraying Him, Judas, said, Master, Not am I [the one]? He said to him, You said [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed [it], and broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is My body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He took the cup and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be offended because of Me this night. For it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I have risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter answered and said to Him, though all shall be offended because of You, I will never be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that this night, before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to Him, though I should die with You, yet I will not deny You. All the disciples also said the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, Sit here while I go and pray there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, and He began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Wait here and watch with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He went a little further and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You [will].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And He came to the disciples and found them asleep. And [He] said to Peter, What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He left them and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, Sleep on now and take [your] rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into [the] hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise, let us be going; behold, he who is betraying Me is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him came a great crowd with swords and clubs, being sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he who betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, He is the one, lay hold on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And coming up to Jesus immediately, he said, Hail, Master! And [he] kissed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out [his] hand and drew his sword, and he struck a servant of the high priest and [cut] off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to him, Put up your sword again into its place; for all who take [the] sword shall perish with a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out in order to take Me with swords and clubs, as against a thief? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hands on Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples fled, forsaking Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they who had seized Jesus led [Him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed Him afar off to the high priest's court, and he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And the chief priests and the elders and all the sanhedrin sought false witness against Jesus, in order to put Him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But they found none; yea, though many false witnesses came, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came up</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, This one said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And standing up, the high priest said to Him, Do you answer nothing? What [is it that] these witness against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, You said [it]. I tell you more. From this time you shall see the Son of man sitting on [the] right [hand] of power, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What do you think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spat in His face and beat Him with the fist. And others struck [Him] with the palms of their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ; who is the [one] who struck you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And Peter sat outside in the court. And a girl came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied all before [them], saying, I do not know what you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he had gone out into the porch, another saw him and said to those there, This one was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Surely you also are [one] of them, for your speech betrays you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man. And immediately the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, Who said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
