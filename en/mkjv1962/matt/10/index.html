You have received freely, freely give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not provide gold nor silver, nor copper in your purses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor a bag for [the] journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor staves. For the workman is worthy of his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who within it is worthy. And there abide until you go away from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when you come into a house, greet it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if the house is worthy, let your peace come on it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I send you out as sheep in [the] midst of wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the sanhedrins, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them and the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And brother will deliver up brother to death, and [the] father [his] child. And the children shall rise up against [their] parents and cause them to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you will be hated of all [men] for My name's sake, but the [one] who endures to [the] end shall be kept safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when they persecute you in this city, flee into another; for truly I say to you, In no way shall you have finished the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A disciple is not above [his] master, nor the servant above his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for the disciple that he is like his master, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and nothing hidden which shall not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear, proclaim on the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore do not fear, you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then everyone who shall confess Me before men, I will confess him before My Father who is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whoever shall deny Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to send peace, but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I have come to set a man against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And a man's foes [shall be] those of his [own] household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He who finds his life shall lose it. And he who loses his life for My sake shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And he who receives a just [one] in the name of a just one will receive a just [one's] reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever shall give to one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] to drink, only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, He shall in no way lose his reward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
