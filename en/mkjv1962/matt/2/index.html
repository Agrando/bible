For we have seen His star in the east and have come to worship Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when Herod the king heard these [things], he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea. For so it is written by the prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you, Bethlehem, [in] the land of Judah, are not the least among the governors of Judah. For out of you shall come a Governor who shall rule My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, inquired of them exactly what time the star appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child. And when you have found [him], bring me word again so that I may come and worship him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they had heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them until it came and stood over where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And seeing the star, they rejoiced [with] exceedingly great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary His mother. And they fell down and worshiped Him. And opening their treasures, they presented gifts to Him, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had departed, behold, the angel of [the] Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and His mother and flee into Egypt. And be there until I bring you word, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he was there until the death of Herod; so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the LORD through the prophet, Out of Egypt I have called My Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was greatly enraged. And he sent and killed all the boys in Bethlehem, and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had carefully inquired of the wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are [not].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herod having expired, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, Arise, and take the child and His mother. And go into [the] land of Israel. For the ones who sought the child's life are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he arose and took the child and His mother and came into [the] land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in his father Herod's place, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
