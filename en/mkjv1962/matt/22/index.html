Come to the marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But not caring, they went their ways, one to [his] field, another to [his] trading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the rest took his servants and treated [them] spitefully, and killed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when the king heard, he was angry. And he sent out his armies and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were invited were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore go into the exits of the highways, and as many as you shall find, invite them to the marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. And the wedding was filled with reclining guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king coming in to look over the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot and take him away, and cast [him] into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees left and took counsel that they might entangle Him in words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent their disciples out to Him along with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth. Nor do you care for anyone, for you do not regard [the] person of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore tell us; what do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you tempt Me, hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show Me the tribute money. And they brought a denarius to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He said to them, Whose image and inscription [is] this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said to Him, Caesar's. Then He said to them, Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they heard [these words], they marveled, and they left Him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On that day the Sadducees came to Him, who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Master, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were with us seven brothers. And the first, when he had married a wife, died. And, having no issue, he left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The second also did likewise, and the third, to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And last of all the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be, of the seven? For they all had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the crowd heard [this], they were astonished at His doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But hearing that He had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then one of them, a lawyer, asked, tempting Him and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Master, which [is] the great commandment in the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and great commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second [is] like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were gathered, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he? They say to Him, David's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said to them, How then does David by the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>the LORD said to my Lord, Sit on My right until I make Your enemies Your footstool for Your feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David then calls Him Lord, how is He his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question Him any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
