First cast the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to cast the splinter out of your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not give that which [is] holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and tear you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For each one who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, it shall be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or what man is there of you, if his son asks a loaf, will he give him a stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or if he asks a fish, will he give him a snake?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore all things, whatever you desire that men should do to you, do even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go in through the narrow gate, for wide [is] the gate and broad [is] the way that leads to destruction, and many there are who go in through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because narrow [is] the gate and constricted [is] the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruits, nor [can] a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore by their fruits you shall know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not everyone who says to Me, Lord! Lord! shall enter the kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to Me in that day, Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in Your name, and through Your name throw out demons, and through Your name do many wonderful works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then I will say to them I never knew you! Depart from Me, those working lawlessness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house. And it did not fall, for it was founded on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And everyone who hears these sayings of Mine and does not do them shall be compared to a foolish man who built his house on the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the wind blew and beat on that house. And it fell, and great was its fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it happened, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For He taught them as [one] having authority, and not as the scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
