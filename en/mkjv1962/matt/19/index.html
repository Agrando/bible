And He healed them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him and saying to Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And He answered and said to them, Have you not read that He who made [them] at the beginning made them male and female,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said, For this cause a man shall leave father and mother and shall cling to his wife, and the two of them shall be one flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to Him, Why did Moses then command to give a bill of divorce and to put her away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, Because of your hard-heartedness Moses allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her [who is] put away commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples said to Him, If this is the case of the man with [his] wife, it is not good to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But He said to them, Not all receive this word, except [those] to whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are some eunuchs who were born so from [their] mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive [it], let him receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then little children were brought to Him, that He should put [His] hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He laid [His] hands on them, and departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, one came and said to Him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He said to him, Why do you call Me good? [There is] none good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to Him, Which? Jesus said, You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>honor your father and mother, and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to Him, I have kept all these things from my youth up; what do I lack yet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to [the] poor, and you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come, follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you that a rich man will with great difficulty enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When His disciples heard, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus looked on [them] and said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then answering Peter said to Him, Behold, we have forsaken all and have followed You. Therefore what shall we have?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And everyone who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many [who are] first shall be last; and the last [shall be] first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
