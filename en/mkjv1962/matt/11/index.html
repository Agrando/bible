A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft [clothing]? Behold, they who wear soft [clothing] are in kings' houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and [one] more excellent than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is [the one] of whom it is written, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly I say to you, Among [those] who have been born of women there has not risen a greater one than John the Baptist. But the least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of Heaven is taken by violence, and the violent take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you will receive [it], this is Elijah who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to what shall I compare to this generation? It is like little children sitting in [the] markets and calling to their playmates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying, We played the flute to you, and you did not dance! We mourned to you, but you did not wail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man who is a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners. But wisdom was justified by her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then He began to upbraid the cities in which most of His mighty works were done, because they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the powerful acts which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to the heaven, shall be brought down to hell. For if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from [the] sophisticated and cunning, and revealed them to babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things are delivered to Me by My Father. And no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son will reveal Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to Me all [you] who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take My yoke on you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest to your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For My yoke [is] easy, and My burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
