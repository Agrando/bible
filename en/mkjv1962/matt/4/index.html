For the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And walking by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea.

And they brought to Him all those being badly ill] suffering various diseases and torments, and [those] who had been possessed with demons, and those who had been moonstruck, and paralytics. And He healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And great multitudes of people followed Him, from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
