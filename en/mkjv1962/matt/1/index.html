And Pharez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and Ram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Salmon fathered Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed of Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and Jesse fathered David the king. And David the king fathered Solomon of [her who had been] wife of Uriah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram, and Jehoram fathered Uzziah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Josiah fathered Jehoiachin and his brothers, at the time they were carried away to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jehoiachin fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Azor fathered Sadoc, and Sadoc fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband [to be] of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So all the generations from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations. And from David until the carrying away into Babylon, fourteen generations. And from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ, fourteen generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was this way (for His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph) before they came together, she was found to be with child by [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Joseph, her husband [to be], being just, and not willing to make her a public example, he purposed to put her away secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as he thought upon these things, behold, the angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take to you Mary [as] your wife. For that in her is fathered of [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she shall bear a son, and you shall call His name JESUS: for He shall save His people from their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now all this happened so that might be fulfilled that which was] spoken of the LORD by the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the virgin shall conceive in [her] womb, and will bear a son. And they will call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joseph, being roused from sleep, did as the angel of [the] Lord commanded him and took his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and did not know her until she bore her son, the First-born. And he called His name JESUS.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
