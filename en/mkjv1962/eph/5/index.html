And arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord [is].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And do not be drunk with wine, in which is excess, but be filled with the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>always giving thanks for all things to God [the] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, submit yourselves to [your] own husbands, as to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ [is] the head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that He might present it to Himself [as] the glorious church, without spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So men ought to love their wives as their [own] bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever yet hated his [own] flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord loves the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two of them shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But also let everyone of you in particular so love his wife even as himself, and the wife that she defers to her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
