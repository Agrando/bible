And the king was planning to set him over all the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the presidents and rulers sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom. But they could find no occasion or fault, because he [was] faithful. Neither [was] there any error or fault found in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then these men said, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then these presidents and rulers assembled to the king, and said this to him: King Darius, live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, and the officials and governors, have planned together to establish a royal law, and to make a strong ban that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except from you, O king, he shall be thrown into the den of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now, O king, establish the ban and sign the writing, so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians which cannot be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the ban.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he had learned that the document was signed, Daniel went to his house. And his windows were open in his roof room toward Jerusalem; and he kneeled on his knees three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and confessing before his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they came near and spoke before the king concerning the king's ban. Have you not signed a ban that every man who shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days, except of you, O king, shall be thrown into the lion's den? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they answered and said before the king, Daniel, who [is] of the exiled sons of Judah, has not respected you, O king, nor the ban that you have signed, but makes his prayer three times a day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the king, when he heard the word, was very much displeased with himself. And he set [his] heart on Daniel to deliver him. And he labored until sundown to deliver him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then these men met before the king and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians [is] that no ban nor law which the king establishes may be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king answered and said to Daniel, Your God, whom you always serve, will deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den. And the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting. And diversions were not brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the king arose very early in the morning and hurried to the lions' den.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he came to the den, he cried with a grieved voice to Daniel. The king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God whom you always serve able to deliver you from the lions?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My God has sent His Angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me, because before Him purity was found in me. And also before you, O king, I have done no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of hurt was found on him, because he trusted in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they threw [them] into the lions' den; them, their sons, and their wives. And the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages who dwell in all the earth. Peace be multiplied to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I make a decree that in all the domain of my kingdom, [there] shall be trembling and fear before the God of Daniel. For He [is] the living God, and endures forever, and His kingdom is that which shall not be destroyed, and His rule [shall be] to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He delivers and rescues, and He works signs and wonders in the heavens and in earth, He who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And this Daniel was blessed in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
