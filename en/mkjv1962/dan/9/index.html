Therefore the curse has been poured out on us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He has confirmed His words which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil. For under all the heavens [it] has not been done as [it] has been done to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As [it is] written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us. Yet we did not make our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand Your truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the LORD has watched over the evil, and has brought it on us. For the LORD our God [is] righteous in all His works which He does; for we did not obey His voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your people out from the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have brought fame to Yourself, as it is today, we have sinned, we have done wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Lord, I pray You, according to all Your righteousness let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain. Because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people [have become] a curse to all those who are around us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, O our God, hear the prayer of Your servant, and his holy desires, and cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary that [is] desolate, for the Lord's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O my God, bow down Your ear and hear. Open Your eyes and behold our ruins, and the city which is called by Your name. For we do not present our prayers before You on account of our righteousnesses, but because of Your great mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, hear; O LORD, forgive; O LORD, listen and do. Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God; for Your city and Your people are called by Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my cry before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yes, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, touched me in [my] severe exhaustion, about the time of the evening sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he enlightened me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I have now come out to give you skill and understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the beginning of your prayers the commandment came out, and I have come to explain. For you are greatly beloved; therefore understand the matter, and attend to the vision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Seventy weeks are decreed as to your people and as to your holy city, to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Know therefore and understand, [that] from the going out of the command to restore and to build Jerusalem, to Messiah [the] Prince, shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks. The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in times of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not [for] Himself. And the people of the ruler who shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. And the end of it [shall be with the flood, and ruins are determined, until [the] end [shall be] war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he shall confirm a covenant with many [for] one week. And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease, and on a corner [of the altar] desolating abominations, even until [the] end. And that which was decreed shall be poured on the desolator.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
