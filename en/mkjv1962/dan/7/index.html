Then he wrote the dream and gave the sum of the matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Daniel spoke and said, In my vision by night I was looking: and behold, the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the Great Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And four great beasts came up from the sea, different from one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings. I watched until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on its feet like a man. And a man's heart was given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold another beast, a second, like a bear. And it raised itself up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said this to it: Arise, eat up much flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After this I saw, and lo, another, like a leopard, which [had] four wings of a bird on its back. The beast also [had] four heads; and rulership was given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After this I looked in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, frightening and terrifying, and very strong. And it [had] great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet. And it [was] different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I was thinking about the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom three of the first horns were uprooted. And behold, in this horn [were] eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I watched until the thrones were thrown up, and the Ancient of Days sat, whose robe [was] white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool. His throne [was] like flames of fire, and His wheels [like] burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A stream of fire went out and came out from before Him. A thousand thousands served Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I was looking because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I watched until the beast was slain, and his body was destroyed and given to the burning flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away. Yet their lives were made longer for a season and time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I saw in the night visions, and behold, [One] like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him near before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And dominion and glory was given Him, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations and languages, should serve Him. His dominion [is] an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I Daniel was distressed in My spirit in its body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I came near one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the meaning of the things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These four great beasts [are] four kings; they shall arise out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I wanted to know the truth of the fourth beast, which [was] different from all the others, very frightening, whose teeth [were of] iron, and his nails of bronze; [who] devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with his feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and of the ten horns that were in his head, and [of] the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even [of] that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking very great things, whose look [was] greater than his fellows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I watched, and that horn made war with the saints and overcame them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High. And the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth, and shall trample it and crush it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the ten horns out of this kingdom [are] ten kings that shall arise. And another shall arise after them. And he shall be different from the first, and he shall humble three kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and plot to change times and laws. And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and one-half time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his rulership, to cut off and to destroy until the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the kingdom and rulership, and the greatness of the kingdom under all the heavens, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom. And all kingdoms shall serve and obey Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Here [is] the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and my face changed on me. But I kept the matter in my heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
