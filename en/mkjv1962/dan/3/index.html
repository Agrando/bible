He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then were gathered the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And whoever does not fall down and worship, at that moment they will be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They spoke and said to king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You, O king, have made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whoever does not fall down and worship, he should be thrown into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There are men, Jews, whom you have set over the business of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, do not heed you. They do not serve your gods nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar in anger and wrath commanded them to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, [Is it] true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? Do you not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if you are ready, at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, fall down and worship the image which I have made. But if you do not worship, in that moment you shall be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that god who shall deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we [have] no need to return a word to you on this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If it is [so that] our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, then He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he commanded mighty men in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw [them] into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then these men were tied up in their slippers, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] clothes, and were thrown into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was amazed. And he rose up in haste and spoke and said to his advisers, Did we not throw three men bound into the middle of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said, Behold! I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and there is no harm among them. And the form of the fourth is like a son of [the] gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near the door of the burning fiery furnace. He answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the most high God, come forth and come [here]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth from the middle of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's advisers gathered and saw these men [on whose] bodies the fire had no power (and the hair of their head was not scorched, nor were their slippers changed, nor had the smell of fire clung on them).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed [be] the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His Angel and has delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and have changed the king's words and has given their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And a decree is given by me, that every people, nation, and language, who speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be made into mere members, and his house shall be made an outhouse. Because there is no other God who can deliver in this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego prosper in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
