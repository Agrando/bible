And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation; until that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the sky; and those who turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But you, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I Daniel looked, and behold, there stood another two, the one on this [side], and the one on that [side] of the bank of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And [one] said to the man clothed in linen on the waters of the river: Until when [shall be] the end of these wonders?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I heard the man clothed in linen, who [was] on the waters of the river, when he held up his right and his left [hand] to Heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that it [shall be] for a time, times, and a half. And when they have made an end of scattering the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, O my lord, what [shall be] the end of these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said, Go, Daniel! For the words [are] closed up and sealed until the end-time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried. But the wicked shall do wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And from the time that the daily [sacrifice] shall be taken away, and the desolating abomination set up, a thousand two hundred and ninety days [shall occur].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed [is] he who waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you go on to the end, for you shall rest and stand in your lot at the end of the days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
