And how mighty [are] His wonders! His kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and His rule [is] from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house and flourishing in my palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I saw a dream and it terrified me, and [the] thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the meaning of the dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the horoscopists, the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the fortune-tellers came in. And I told the dream before them, but they did not make its meaning known to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But at last Daniel came in before me, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods. And I told the dream before him, [saying] ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Belteshazzar, master of the horoscopists, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods [is] in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As to the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height [was] great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The tree grew and was strong, and its height reached to the heavens; and the sight of it reached to the end of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Its leaves [were] beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and in it [was] food for all. The animals of the field sought shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its boughs, and all flesh was fed by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He cried aloud and said this, Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches; shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals get away from under it, and the birds from its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion [be] with the animals in the grass of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let his heart be changed from man's, and let the heart of an animal be given to him. And let seven times pass over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones, so that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen this dream. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its meaning, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make the meaning known to me. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods [is] in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stunned for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream  is] to those who hate you, and its meaning to your foes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree that you saw, which became great and strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whose leaves were fair, and its fruit plentiful, and in it [was] food for all, under which the animals of the field dwelt, and on whose branches the birds of the heavens had their home;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>it [is] you, O king, for you have become great and strong, for your greatness has grown and reached to the heaven, and your rule to the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from Heaven, and saying, Cut the tree down and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots of it in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>this [is] the meaning, O king, and this the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field, and they shall make you eat grass like oxen. And they shall wet you [with] the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in that they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom [shall be] sure to you after you have known that Heaven rules.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, O king, let my advice be pleasing to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, whether there will be duration to your prosperity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king spoke and said, [Is] this not great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>While the word [was] in the king's mouth, a voice fell from Heaven, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken. The kingdom has departed from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. They shall make you eat grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The same hour the thing was fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men, and ate grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens, until his hair had grown like eagles'  feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the end of days, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to Heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored Him who lives forever, whose kingdom  is] an everlasting kingdom, and His rule is from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all the people of the earth are counted as nothing; and He does according to His will in the army of heaven, and [among] the people of the earth. And none can strike His hand, or say to Him, What are You doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>At that time my reason returned to me. And the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me. And my advisers and my lords came for me, and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and exalt and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth and His ways judgment. And those who walk in pride He is able to humble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
