And the thing was true, and a great conflict. And he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I ate no food for delight, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And in the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which [is] Tigris,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man was clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>His body also [was] like the beryl, and his face looked like lightning. And his eyes [were] like lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet in color were like polished bronze, and the voice of his words like the sound of a multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision. For the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me. For my beauty was turned within me to corruption, and I kept no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yet I heard the voice of his words. And when I heard the voice of his words, then I was in a deep sleep on my face, and my face [was] toward the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And behold, a hand touched me, which set me shaking on my knees and the palms of my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright. For to you I am now sent. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he said to me, Do not fear, Daniel; for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard. And I have come for your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the ruler of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days. But lo, Michael, one of the chief rulers, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is yet for [many] days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had spoken such words to me, I bowed my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, one looking like the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, O lord, my sorrows are turned on me by the vision, and I have kept no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how can the servant of my lord talk with my lord? For as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, nor is there breath left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then again [one] like a man in form came and touched me, and he made me stronger</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and said, O man greatly beloved, do not fear. Peace to you; be strong; yes, be strong. And when he had spoken to me, I was made stronger, and [I] said, Speak my lord, for you have made me stronger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he said, Do you know why I come to you? And now I will return to fight with the ruler of Persia. And when I have gone out, lo, the ruler of Greece shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will show you that which is written in the Scripture of Truth. And there is none who holds strongly with me in these things, but Michael your ruler.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
