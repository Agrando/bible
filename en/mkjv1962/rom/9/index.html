Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not however that the word of God has failed, for not all those of Israel [are] Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>nor because they are the seed of Abraham [are they] all children. But, In Isaac shall your Seed be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, not the children of the flesh [are] children of God; but the children of the promise [are] counted for a seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this [is] the word of promise: At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only [this], but when Rebekah also had conceived by one, by our father Isaac</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(for [the children] had not yet been born, neither had done any good or evil; but that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of Him who called,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we say then? [Is there] not unrighteousness with God? Let it not be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For He said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then [it is] not of the [one] willing, nor of the [one] running, but of God, the [One] showing mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name might be declared throughout all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore He has mercy on whom He will [have mercy], and whom He will, He hardens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will then say to me, Why does He yet find fault? For who has resisted His will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No, but, O man, who are you who replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him who formed [it], Why have you made me this way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[What] if God, willing to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He had before prepared to glory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom He also called, not only us, of Jews, but also of the nations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As He also says in Hosea, I will call those not My people, My people; and those not beloved, Beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them. You [are] not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the sons of Israel is as the sands of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For [He is] bringing [the] matter to an end, and cutting short in righteousness, because [the] Lord will make a short work on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as Isaiah said before, Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have been as Sodom, and would have been like Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say then? That the nations, who did not follow after righteousness have taken on righteousness, but a righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel, who followed after a law of righteousness did not arrive at a law of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why? Because [it was] not of faith, but as it were by the works of the Law. For they stumbled at that Stumbling-stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a Stumbling-stone and a Rock-of-offense, and everyone believing on Him shall not be put to shame.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
