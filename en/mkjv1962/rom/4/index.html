Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But to him working, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to him not working, but believing on Him justifying the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even as David also says of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[saying], Blessed are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>blessed [is] the man to whom [the] Lord will in no way impute sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[Is] this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it reckoned? Being in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received a sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith [while still] uncircumcised; so that he might be [the] father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for righteousness to be imputed to them also;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and a father of circumcision to those not of the circumcision only, but also to those walking by the steps of the faith of our father Abraham during uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the promise that he should be the heir of the world [was] not to Abraham or to his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if they of the Law [are] heirs, faith is made void and the promise is made of no effect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>because the Law works out wrath, for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore [it is] of faith so that [it might be] according to grace; for the promise to be made sure to all the seed, not only to that which is of the Law, but to that also which is of  the] faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(as it has been written, I have made you a father of many nations) --before God, whom he believed, who makes the dead live, and calls the things [which] do not exist as [though they] do exist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[For he] who beyond hope believed on hope for him to become the father of many nations (according to that which was spoken, So your seed shall be).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body already dead (being about a hundred years old) or the deadening of Sarah's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and being fully persuaded that what God had promised, He was also able to perform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it was not written for him alone that it was imputed to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but for us also to whom it is to be imputed, to the ones believing on Him who has raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was delivered because of our offenses and was raised for our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
