Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let it not be! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised up from [the] dead by the glory of the Father; even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if we have been joined together in the likeness of His death, we shall also be [in the likeness] of His resurrection;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [Him] in order that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he who died has been justified from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>knowing that when Christ was raised from [the] dead, He dies no more; death no longer has dominion over Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For in that He died, He died to sin once; but in that He lives, He lives to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Likewise count yourselves also to be truly dead to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not yield your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God, as [one] alive from [the] dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under Law, but under grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law, but under grace?

For the end of those things [is] death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now, being made free from sin, and having become slaves to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin [is] death, but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
