And they who have not heard shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For this cause I also have been greatly hindered from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now, having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whenever I may go into Spain, I will come to you. For [in] traveling through I hope to see you, and to be set forward there by you, if first I may be filled of you in part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it has pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Truly it has pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in fleshly things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore when I have completed this, and have sealed this fruit to them, I will come by you into Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of [the] blessing of the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But I exhort you, brothers, for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from those disbelieving in Judea, and that my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>so that [I may] come to you with joy by [the] will of God, and may be refreshed with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now may the God of peace [be] with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
