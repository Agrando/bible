But if anyone has not [the] Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if Christ [is] in you, indeed the body [is] dead because of sin, but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of the [One] who raised up Jesus from [the] dead dwells in you, the [One] who raised up Christ from [the] dead shall also make your mortal bodies alive by His Spirit who dwells in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brothers, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die. But if you through [the] Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption by which we cry, Abba, Father!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if we are children, then we are heirs; heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; so that if we suffer with [Him], we may also be glorified together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was not willingly subjected to vanity, but because of Him who subjected [it] on hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only [so], but ourselves also, who have the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, awaiting adoption, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope; for what anyone sees, why does he also hope [for it] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for that which we do not see, [then] we wait for it with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He searching the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because He makes intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to [His] purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, for Him to be [the] First-born among many brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, those He also justified. And whom He justified, these He also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then shall we say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [can be] against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Truly [He] who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? [It is] God who justifies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who [is] he condemning? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather also [who is] raised, who is also at [the] right [hand] of God, who also intercedes for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? [Shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As it is written, For Your sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
