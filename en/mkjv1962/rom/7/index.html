But if the husband is dead, she is set free from the law of [her] husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So then [if], while [her] husband lives, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, [so that] she is no adulteress by becoming another man's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ so that you should be married to Another, [even] to Him raised from [the] dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin worked in our members through the law to bring forth fruit to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now we having been set free from the Law, having died [to that] in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not [in] oldness of the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? Let it not be said! But I did not know sin except through the law. For also I did not know lust except the law said, You shall not lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all kinds of lust. For apart from law sin [was] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I was alive without the law once. But when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the commandment, which [was] to life, was found [to be] death to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed [me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So indeed the Law [is] holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then has that [which is] good become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear [to be] sin, working death in me by [that which is] good; in order that sin might become exceedingly sinful by the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that which I do, I know not. For what I desire, that I do not do; but what I hate, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If then I do that which I do not desire, I consent to the law that [it is] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But now it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing. For to will is present with me, but [how] to perform [that which is] good I do not find.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I do not do the good that I desire; but the evil which I do not will, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I do what I do not desire, [it is] no more I working it out, but sin dwelling in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find then a law: when I will to do the right, evil is present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin being in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O wretched man [that] I [am]! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
