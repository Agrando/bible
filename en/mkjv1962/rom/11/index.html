Let it not be [said]! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of [the] tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God did not thrust out His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture said in Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lord, they killed Your prophets and dug down Your altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what does the Divine answer say to him? I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so then, also in this present time a remnant according to the election of grace has come into being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if by grace, then [it is] no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace. But if [it is] of works, then it is no more of grace; otherwise work is no more work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel has not obtained that which it seeks, but the election obtained [it], and the rest were hardened</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>even as it is written, God gave to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not seeing, and ears not hearing until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said, Let their table become for a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see, and their back always bowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say then, Did they not stumble that they fall? Let it not be! But by their slipping away came salvation to the nations, to provoke them to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if their slipping away [is] the riches of [the] world, and their default is [the] riches of [the] nations, how much more their fullness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I speak to you, the nations; since I am the apostle of the nations, I glorify my ministry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if by any means I may provoke [those who are] my flesh to jealousy, and might save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if their casting away [is the] reconciling of [the] world, what [is] the reception except life from [the] dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the firstfruit [is] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]; and if the root [is] holy, also the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and became a sharer of the root and the fatness of the olive tree with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not boast against the branches. But if you boast, [it is] not you [that] bears the root, but the root bears you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say then, The branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not [be] high-minded, but fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For if God did not spare the natural branches, [fear] lest He also may not spare you either!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold then [the] kindness, and [the] severity of God; on those having fallen, severity; but on you, kindness, if you continue in the kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if you were cut out of the natural wild olive [tree], and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive [tree]; how much more these [being] according to nature will be grafted into [their] own olive-tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, lest you should be wise within yourselves; that blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the nations has comes in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this [is] My covenant with them, when I have taken away their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Indeed as regards the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes. But as regards the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers' sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the free gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as you also then disbelieved God, but now have been shown mercy through their disbelief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>even so these also have not believed now, so that through your mercy they may also obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has shut up all in unbelief, so that He might show mercy to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O [the] depth of [the] riches both of [the] wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable [are] His judgments, and His ways past finding out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, or who became His counselor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Or who first gave to Him, and it will be repaid to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For of Him and through Him and to Him [are] all things; to Him be glory forever! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
