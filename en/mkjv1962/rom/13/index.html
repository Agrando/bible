For there is no authority but of God; the authorities that exist are ordained by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So that the one resisting the authority resists the ordinance of God; and the ones who resist will receive judgment to themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire to be not afraid of the authority? Do the good, and you shall have praise from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For it is a servant of God to you for good. For if you practice evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain; for it is a servant of God, a revenger for wrath on him who does evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore [you] must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For because of this you also pay taxes. For they are God's servants, always giving attention to this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore give to all [their] dues; to the [one due] tax, the tax; tribute to whom tribute [is due], fear to whom fear [is due], and honor to whom honor [is due].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For: Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; do not lust; and if [there is] any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love works no ill to its neighbor, therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This also, knowing the time, that [it is] already time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation [is] nearer than when we believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night [is] far spent, the day is at hand; therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk becomingly, as in [the] day; not in carousings and drinking; not in co-habitation and lustful acts; not in strife and envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take thought beforehand for the lusts of the flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
