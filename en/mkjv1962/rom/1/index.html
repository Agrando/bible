Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>always in my prayers, making request if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to you for the establishing of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this is to be comforted together with you by our mutual faith, both yours and mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, and was kept back until the present; that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the foreigners, both to the wise and to the unwise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So, as much as is in me [lies], I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are at Rome also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is [the] power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because the thing which may be known of God is clearly revealed within them, for God revealed [it] to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the unseen things of Him from [the] creation of [the] world [are] clearly seen, being realized by the things that are made, [even] His eternal power and Godhead, for them to be without excuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful. But [they] became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Professing to be wise, they became fools</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of [their] hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For they changed the truth of God into a lie, and they worshiped and served the created thing more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this cause, God gave them up to dishonorable affections. For even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another; males with males working out shamefulness, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And even as they did not think fit to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do the things not right,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; [being] full of envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, evil habits, [becoming] whisperers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>backbiters, haters of God, insolent, proud, braggarts, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>undiscerning, perfidious, without natural] affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who, knowing the righteous order of God, that those practicing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but have pleasure in those practicing [them].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
