The word is near you, [even] in your mouth and in your heart; that is, the word of faith which we proclaim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because if you confess the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from [the] dead, you shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with [the] heart [one] believes unto righteousness, and with [the] mouth [one] confesses unto salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Scripture says, Everyone believing on Him shall not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no difference both of Jew and of Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For everyone, whoever shall call on the name of [the] Lord will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without preaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful [are] the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But [they have] not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then faith [is] of hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, Have they not heard? Yes indeed, their voice went out into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy by [those who are] no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Isaiah [is] very bold and says, I was found by those who did not seek Me, I became known to those who did not ask after Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But to Israel He says, All day long I have stretched forth My hands to a disobeying and gainsaying people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
