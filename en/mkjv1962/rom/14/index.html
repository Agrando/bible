To his own master he stands or falls. But he will stand, for God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One indeed esteems a day above [another] day; and [another] esteems every day [alike]. Let each one be fully assured in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who regards the day regards [it] to the Lord; and he not regarding the day, does not regard [it] to the Lord. He who eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, does not eat to [the Lord, and gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For both if we live, we live to [the] Lord; and if we die, we die to [the] Lord. Therefore both if we live, and if we die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this Christ both died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord both of [the] dead and living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But why do you judge your brother? Or also why do you despise your brother? For all shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written,  As] I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each one of us will give account concerning himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then let us not judge one another any more, but rather judge this, not to put a stumbling-block or an offense toward his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am persuaded in [the] Lord Jesus, that nothing by itself [is] common; except to him who esteems anything to be common, [it is] common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if your brother is grieved with [your] food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then do not let your good be spoken evil of,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he who serves Christ in these things [is] well-pleasing to God, and approved by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for building up one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not undo the work of God for food. Truly, all things indeed [are] clean, but [it is] bad to the man eating because of a stumbling-block.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [anything] by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you have faith? Have [it] to yourself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, the one doubting, if he eats, [he] has been condemned, because it is not of faith; and all that [is] not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
