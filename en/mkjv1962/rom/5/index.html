For if by the offense of the one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace; which [is] of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the free gift [shall] not [be] as by one having sinned; (for indeed the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offenses to justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore as by one offense [sentence came] on all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of One the free gift [came] to all men to justification of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the Law entered so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that as sin has reigned to death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
