Or what [is] the profit of circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Much, by every way! Chiefly, indeed, because they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what? If some did not believe, will not their unbelief nullify the faith of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let it not be! But let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That You might be justified in Your sayings, and will overcome when You are judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who lays on wrath? (I speak as a man.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let it not be! For then how shall God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if in my lie the truth has more abounded to His glory why am I still judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And not [rather], (as we are wrongly accused, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do bad things that good may come? [Their] condemnation is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Do we excel? No, in no way; for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks all [with] being under sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as it is written: There is none righteous, no not one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>there is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They are all gone out of the way, [they] have together become unprofitable, there is none that does good, no, not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat [is] an open grave, with their tongues they have used deceit, [the] poison of asps [is] under their lips;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>their feet [are] swift to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>destruction and misery [are] in their way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the way of peace they did not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But we know that whatever things the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law; so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be under judgment before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because by the works of the Law none of all flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law [is] the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now a righteousness of God has been revealed apart from Law, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ, toward all and upon all those who believe. For there is no difference,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God has set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness through the passing by of the sins that had taken place before, in the forbearance of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the display of His righteousness at this time, for Him to be just and, forgiving the [one] being of the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then where [is] the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or [is He] the God of the Jews only, and not also of the nations? Yes, of the nations also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>since [it is] one God who will justify circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make the Law void through faith? Let it not be! But we establish the Law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
