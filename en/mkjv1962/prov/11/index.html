but a just weight [is] His delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Pride comes, then shame comes; but with the lowly [is] wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The integrity of the upright shall guide them; but the crookedness of traitors shall destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The righteousness of the perfect shall make his way right, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but deceivers shall be taken in lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When a wicked man dies, his hope shall perish; and the hope of evil ones shall be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes [in] his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A hypocrite corrupts [his] neighbor with [his] mouth; but through knowledge the just shall be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices; and when the wicked are destroyed, [there is] singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By the blessing of the upright the city is lifted up, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One despising his friend lacks heart, but a man of understanding remains silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>One going with slander is a revealer of secrets, but the faithful of spirit keeps the matter hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Where [there is] no wisdom, the people fall; but in the multitude of wise men [there is] safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who is surety for a stranger shall be ruined; and he who hates suretyship is safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A gracious woman keeps honor, and the strong keep riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The merciful man does good to his own soul, but [he who is] cruel troubles his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The wicked makes a deceitful wage; but one sowing righteousness [has] a sure reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So righteousness [tends] to life; but one pursuing evil, [it is] to his own death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They who are of a perverse heart [are] hateful to the LORD, but the upright in the way [are] His delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[Though] hand [join] in hand, the wicked shall not be innocent;

the hope of the wicked [is] wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is one who scatters and yet increases; but one who withholds just due [comes] only to poverty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The soul who gives freely shall be made fat; and he who waters shall also be watered himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who withholds grain, the people shall curse him; but blessing [is] on the head of him who sells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who carefully seeks good gets favor; but he who seeks mischief, it shall come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He who trusts in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall blossom like a branch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind; and the fool [shall be] servant to the wise in heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The fruit of the righteous [is] a tree of life; and he who takes souls [is] wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the righteous shall be rewarded in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
