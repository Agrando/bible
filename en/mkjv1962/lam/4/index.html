The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The precious sons of Zion are weighed against pure gold; how they are counted as earthen vessels, the work of a potter's hand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even the jackals draw out the breast; they suckle their young ones. The daughter of my people [is] cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The suckling's tongue cleaves to his palate in thirst; the young children ask bread; there is no breaking to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets; those reared in scarlet embrace dunghills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is heaped more than the sin of Sodom, overthrown as [in] a moment, and no hands spun on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Her Nazarites [were] purer than snow, whiter than milk; they [were] redder [of] bone than corals; their cuttings [as] lapis lazuli, [azure blue].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their appearance is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled on their bones; it is dried up; it has become like wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Better [are] the ones slain by the sword than the ones slain by hunger; those who pine away, pierced because the fruits of my fields [failed].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The hands of the pitying women have boiled their own children; they became their food in the ruin of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The LORD has fulfilled His fury; He has poured out His fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has devoured its foundations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The kings of the earth, and all the people of the world, would not have believed that the foe and the hater would go into Jerusalem's gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the sins of her prophets [and] the iniquities of her priests, shedding the blood of the just in her midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>they reeled blind in the streets; they are defiled with blood, so that not [any] can touch their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They cried to them, Depart! Unclean! Depart, depart! Touch not! Indeed they fled and reeled; they said among the nations, They will not continue to live [there].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The face of the LORD has shared them out; He will no longer look on them; they did not respect the persons of the priests; they did not favor the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While we are, our eyes fail, for our help is vain; in our watching we have watched for a nation; it does not save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They hunted our steps from going in our streets; our end was near, our days were fulfilled, for our end has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens; they pursued us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed [of] the LORD, was taken in their pits; of whom we said, In his shadow we shall live among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, who lives in the land of Uz. The cup also shall pass through unto you; you shall be drunken and stripped naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The punishment of your iniquity [is] fulfilled, O daughter of Zion; He will exile you no more.
