O LORD, You have been our dwelling-place in all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting You [are] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You turn man to dust, and say, Return, sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For a thousand years in Your sight [are] as yesterday when it is past, and [as] a watch in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You carry them away as with a flood; they are [as] a sleep; in the morning [they are] like grass which grows up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the morning it sprouts and shoots up; in the evening it is cut down, and dries up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we are burned up by Your anger, and by Your wrath we are troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You have set our iniquities before You, our secret [sins] in the light of Your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all our days pass away in Your wrath; we finish our years like a murmur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The days of our years [are] threescore years and ten; and if by strength they [are] fourscore years, yet their pride [is] labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who knows the power of Your anger? And as Your fear [is, so is] Your wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So teach us to number our days, so that we may bring a heart of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Return, O LORD! How long?
