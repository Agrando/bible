[A Psalm] of David, the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul; and he said: I love You, O LORD, my strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The LORD [is] my strength, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock; I will trust in Him; [He is] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will call on the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The sorrows of death hemmed me in, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The sorrows of hell surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In my distress I called on the LORD, and I cried to my God; He heard my voice out of His temple, and my cry came before Him, into His ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; and the foundations of the hills moved and were shaken, because He was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire devoured out of His mouth; coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He bowed the heavens and came down, and darkness [was] under His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He rode on a cherub, and flew; yea, He soared on the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness His secret place, His pavilion around Him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At the brightness before Him, His dark clouds passed through, hailstones and coals of fire passed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave forth His voice; hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yea, He sent out His arrows and scattered them; and He shot out lightnings and crushed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered, at Your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too strong for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They went before me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has repaid me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all His judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away His statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was also upright before Him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD has returned to me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the merciful, You will show Yourself merciful; with an upright man You will show Yourself upright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>with the pure You will show Yourself pure; and with the crooked You will show Yourself perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For You will save the afflicted people, but will bring down high looks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For You will light my candle; the LORD my God will make my darkness light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For by You I have run through a troop; and by my God I have leaped over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>[As for] God, His way [is] perfect; the Word of the LORD [is] tried; He [is] a shield to all those who trust in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who [is] God besides Jehovah?
