For stringed instruments. A contemplation. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not Yourself from my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Attend to me, and hear me; I wander and I moan in my complaint,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>from the voice of the enemy, from the oppression of the wicked, for they shake trouble over me, and in wrath they hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart is pained within me; and the terrors of death have fallen on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fear and trembling have come on me, and horror has covered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I said, Who will give to me wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo, I would wander far off; I would lodge in the desert.
