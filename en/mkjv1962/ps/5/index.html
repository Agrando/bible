A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my meditation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to You I will pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My voice You shall hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning I will direct [my prayer] to You, and I will look up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For You [are] not a God that enjoys wickedness; nor shall evil dwell with You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The foolish shall not stand in Your sight. You hate all doers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall destroy those who speak lies; the LORD will despise the bloody and deceitful man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I, in the abundance of Your grace, I will come [into] Your house; I will worship in Your fear toward Your holy temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make Your way straight before my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For [there is] no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is wickedness; their throat [is] an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hold them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But let all who put their trust in You rejoice; let them always shout for joy, because You defend them.
