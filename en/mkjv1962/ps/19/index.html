A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse proclaims His handiwork.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>[There is] no speech nor [are] there words; their voice is not heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their line has gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world. In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and he comes forth as a bridegroom from his canopy; he rejoices as a strong man to run a race,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>going forth from the end of the heavens, and its course [is] to their ends. And there is nothing hid from its heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making the simple wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The statutes of the LORD [are] right, rejoicing the heart; the commandments of the LORD [are] pure, giving light to the eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The fear of the LORD [is] clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD [are] true [and] righteous altogether,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>more to be desired than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Your servant is warned by them; in keeping them there [is] great reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who can understand [his] errors? Oh make me pure from secret [faults] ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and keep Your servant back from presumptuous [sins]; do not let them rule over me; then I shall be upright, and I shall be innocent of great transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
