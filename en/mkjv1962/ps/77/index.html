To Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, to God [is] my voice; and He gave ear to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In the day of my trouble I sought the LORD; my hand was poured in the night, and ceased not; my soul refused to be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit fainted. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You keep my eyes awake; I am troubled and I cannot speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have thought on the days of old, the years of ages [past].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I remember my song in the night; I speak with my own heart, and my spirit carefully searches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Is His mercy gone forever?
