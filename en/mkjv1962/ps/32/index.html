Blessed [is] the man whose transgression [is] forgiven, whose sin [is] covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Blessed [is] the man to whom the LORD does not charge iniquity, and in whose spirit there [is] no guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When I kept silence, my bones became old through my roaring all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For by day and by night Your hand [was] heavy on me; my sap is turned into the droughts of summer. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I confessed my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, I will confess my transgression to the LORD; and You forgave the iniquity of my sin.
