O give thanks to the LORD; for [He is] good; for His mercy [endures] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD, or cause all His praise to be heard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed [are] those who keep judgment, he who does righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O LORD, with the favor of Your people; O visit me with Your salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may see the good of Your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, to glory with Your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers did not understand Your wonders in Egypt; they did not remember the multitude of Your mercies, but rebelled at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But He saved them for His name's sake, to make His mighty power known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; so He led them through the depths, [as] through the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He saved them from the hand of the hater, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their enemies; there was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed His words; they sang His praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They hurried [and] forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but they lusted greedily in the wilderness, and tested God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He gave them what they asked, but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, [and] Aaron the saint of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the melted image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they changed their Glory into the likeness of an ox that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God their Deliverer, who had done great things in Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>wonderful works in the land of Ham, fearful things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He said that He would destroy them, if Moses His chosen had not stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, so that He should not destroy [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but murmured in their tents, [and] did not listen to the voice of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He lifted up His hand to them, to overthrow them in the wilderness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they joined themselves to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and provoked [Him] to anger with their doings; and the plague broke in on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Phinehas stood and interceded, and the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it was counted to him for righteousness to all generations forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they angered [Him] at the waters of strife so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they provoked his spirit so that he spoke rashly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the nations [as] the LORD commanded them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but were mixed among the nations, and learned their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they served their idols, which were a snare to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they were defiled with their works, and went lusting in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the wrath of the LORD was kindled against His people, and He detested His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He gave them into the hand of the nations; and those who hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And their enemies oppressed them, and they were humbled under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times He delivered them, but they rebelled in their counsel and sank in their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He looked on their affliction when He heard their cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and He remembered [His] covenant for them, and was moved to pity, according to the multitude of His mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And He gave them to tender mercies before the face of all their captors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to Your holy name [and] to triumph in Your praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed [is] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting; and let all the people say, Amen. Praise the LORD!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
