Do not fret yourself with evil doers; and do not be envious against the workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For they shall soon wither like the grass; and fade as the green herb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Trust in the LORD, and do good; you shall dwell in the land, and you shall be fed on truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Delight yourself also in the LORD, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Roll your way on the LORD; trust also in Him, and He will work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He shall bring forth your righteousness like the light, and your judgment like the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; do not fret yourself because of him who prospers in his way, because of him who practices wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; do not fret yourself to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evildoers shall be cut off; but those who wait on the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[It is] but a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, you shall search his place, and he shall not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the overflowing of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes on him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD laughs at him; for He sees that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to kill those who walk uprightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little to the righteous [is] better than the riches of many wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the LORD upholds the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The LORD knows the days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked shall pass, and the enemies of the LORD [shall be] like the beauty of pastures; they are consumed, like smoke they perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked borrows, and never pays again; but the righteous shows mercy, and gives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For His blessed ones shall inherit the earth; and those cursed by Him shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The steps of a [good] man are ordered by the LORD; and He delights in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Though he fall, he shall not be cast down; for the LORD upholds his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, or his seed begging bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day long he deals graciously, and lends; and his seed [is] blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil and do good; and live forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the LORD loves judgment and does not forsake His saints; they are kept forever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell in it forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God [is] in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor allow [him] to be found guilty when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wait on the LORD, and keep His way, and He shall lift you up to inherit the earth; when the wicked are cut off, you shall see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked ruthless, and spreading himself like a luxuriant native [tree].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Yet he passed away, and, lo, he [was] not; and I looked for him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Watch the perfect and behold the upright one; for the end of [that] man [is] peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the sinners are destroyed together; the end of the wicked is cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous [is] from the LORD; [He is] their strength in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them; He shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
