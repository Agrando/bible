O LORD, You have searched me and have known [me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You search my path and my lying down, and are acquainted [with] all my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For [there is] not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, You know it altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have closed me in behind and in front, and laid Your hand on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Such knowledge [is] too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot go up to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Where shall I go from Your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from Your presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I go up into Heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You [are there].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[If] I take the wings of the morning [and] dwell in the furthest parts of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>even there shall Your hand lead me, and Your right hand shall hold me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night [shall be] light around me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, the darkness does not hide from You; but the night shines as the day; as [is] the darkness, so is the light to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For You have possessed my inward parts; You have covered me in my mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will praise You; for I am fearfully [and] wonderfully made; Your works [are] marvelous and my soul knows [it] very well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My bones were not hidden from You when I was made in secret [and] skillfully formed in the lowest parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your eyes saw my embryo; and in Your book all [my members] were written, the days they were formed, and not one [was] among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[If] I should count them, they are more than the sand; when I awake, I am still with You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Surely You will slay the wicked, O God; and bloody men, depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who will speak against You maliciously?
