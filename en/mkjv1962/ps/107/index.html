for His mercy [endures] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let the redeemed of the LORD say [so], whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They wandered in the wilderness, in a desert by the way; they found no city to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they cried to the LORD in their distress, and He delivered them out of their troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He guided them by the right way, so as to go to a city to live in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh that men would praise the LORD [for] His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For He satisfies the thirsty soul, and fills the hungry soul [with] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those who sit in the darkness and in the shadow of death, [being] chained in affliction and iron;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because they rebelled against the words of God, and despised the advice of the Most High.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and He humbled their heart with labor; they fell down, and none [was] helping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they cried to the LORD in their distress, [and] He saved them out of their troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bands in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them praise the LORD [for] His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For He has broken the gates of bronze, and cut the bars of iron in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools are afflicted because of their rebellion, and because of their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their soul hates all kinds of food; and they draw near the gates of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they cry to the LORD in their distress, [and] He saves them out of their troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sent His word and heals them, and delivers [them] from their pitfalls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Let them praise the LORD [for] His goodness, and [for] His wonderful works to the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with rejoicing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>these see the works of the LORD and His wonders in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For He commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They mount up to the heavens, they go down again [to] the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and all their wisdom is swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they cry to the LORD in their trouble, and He brings them out of their troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they are glad because they are quiet; so He brings them to their desired haven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let them praise the LORD [for] His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people, and praise Him in the gathering of the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He sets rivers to a wilderness and water-springs to thirsty ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>a fruitful land to a salty desert, because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He turns the wilderness into a water-ponds, and dry ground into water-springs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He makes the hungry dwell there, so that they may prepare a city to live in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He also blesses them, so that they are multiplied greatly; and does not allow their cattle to become few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again, they have become few, and humbled through harshness, affliction, and sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He pours scorn on nobles, and causes them to wander in the wilderness, [where there is] no path.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But He raises up the poor from affliction and sets families like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The upright shall see and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop its mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Whoever [is] wise, and will observe these [things], they shall understand the mercies of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
