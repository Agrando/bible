A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and He bowed down to me, and heard my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, [and] set my feet on a rock, and gave sureness to my steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He has put a new song in my mouth, praise to our God; many shall see [it] and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed [is] the man who makes the LORD his trust and does not turn to the proud, nor to those who turn aside [to] a lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O LORD my God, many things You have done, Your wonderful works and Your thoughts [which] [are] toward us; they cannot be set in order to You; I will declare and speak, for they are more than can be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; My ears You have opened; burnt offering and sin offering You have not asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, Lo, I come, in the volume of the Book [it is] written of Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I delight to do Your will, O My God; and Your law [is] within My heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo, I have not kept back My lips, O LORD, You know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not hidden Your loving-kindness and Your truth from the great congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O LORD; let Your loving-kindness and Your truth always watch over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For evils without number have hemmed me in; my sins have taken hold on me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them be ashamed and humbled together, those who seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame, those who wish me evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be desolate as a reward for their shame, those who say to me, Aha, aha!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You, and the ones loving your salvation always say, Let the LORD be magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But I [am] poor and needy; the LORD will care for me; You [are] my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not wait.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
