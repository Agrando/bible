call on His name; make known His deeds among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; talk of all His wonderful works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Glory in His holy name; let the heart of those who seek the LORD rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Seek the LORD and His strength; seek His face evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember His marvelous works which He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>seed of His servant Abraham, sons of Jacob His chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He [is] the LORD our God; His judgments [are] in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He has remembered His covenant forever, the word [which] He commanded to a thousand generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>the covenant which He made with Abraham, and His oath to Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and He confirmed it to Jacob for a law, and to Israel [for] an everlasting covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>when they were [a few] men in number;

yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[saying], Touch not my anointed, and do My prophets no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He called for a famine on the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent a man before them, Joseph, [being] sold for a servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>whose feet they hurt with chains; he was laid in iron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>until the time that his word came, the word of the LORD refined him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king sent and set him free; the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all he owned,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>to chain his leaders at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Israel also came [into] Egypt, and Jacob resided in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He increased His people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal craftily with His servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent Moses His servant, [and] Aaron whom He had chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They showed His signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He sent darkness, and made it dark;

and there [was] not one feeble person among their tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them had fallen on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light [in] the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>[They] asked, and He brought quail, and satisfied them [with] the food of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places [like] a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For He remembered His holy promise [and] Abraham His servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen with gladness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and gave them the lands of the nations; and they inherited the labor of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>so that they might take heed to His statutes and keep His laws.
