A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all inhabitants of the world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>both sons of mankind, and sons of man, rich and poor together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>my mouth shall speak of wise things; and the thoughts of my heart [shall be] of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will bow down my ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying on the harp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why should I fear in the days of evil, [when] the perversity of my ambushers will surround me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Those who trust in their wealth, and their many riches, boast themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A man cannot at all redeem a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for the redemption of their soul [is] precious, and it ceases forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>yea, he shall yet live forever; he shall never see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he sees wise men die; likewise the fool and the animal-like ones perish, and leave their wealth to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Their inward [thought is that] their houses shall [go on] forever, and their dwelling-places to all generations; they call [their] lands after their own names.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But man, though high in honor, does not remain; he is like the animals [that] perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This way of theirs [is] their foolishness; yet their followers delight in their sayings. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like sheep they are appointed to the grave; death shall reign [for] them; and the upright shall have the rule over them in the morning; and their form [is] for rotting; the grave [is] their home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But God will redeem my soul from the hand of the grave; for He will take me. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not afraid when one becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for when he dies he shall take nothing away; his glory shall not go down after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in his life he blessed his soul; yea, they praise you when you do well to yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Man in honor, but without understanding, is like the animals; they shall perish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
