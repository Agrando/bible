Strive, O LORD, with those who strive with me; fight against those who fight against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Take hold of a shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Also draw out the spear and the lance against those who pursue me; say to my soul, I [am] your salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let them be humbled and put to shame, those who seek after my soul; let them be turned back and be brought to blushing, those who plot evil to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let them be as chaff before the wind; and let the Angel of Jehovah drive [them] away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let their way be dark and slippery; and let the Angel of Jehovah pursue them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For without cause they have spread their net for me [in] a pit-net; without cause they have dug for my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let destruction come upon him, he will not know; and let his net which he has concealed catch him, let him fall in it, into destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; it shall rejoice in His salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All my bones shall say, O LORD, who [is] like You, who delivers the poor from those stronger than he; yea, the poor and the needy from him who plunders him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Cruel witnesses rose up; they asked of me that which I never knew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They rewarded me evil for good; bereaving my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when they were sick, my clothing [was] sackcloth; I humbled my soul with fastings; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As a friend, as to my brother, I walked; as one who mourns for a mother, I was bowed down, mourning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But in my stumbling they rejoiced, and gathered themselves; the defamers gathered themselves against me, and I knew not; they tore and were not silent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>with the hypocrites, mockers, [for] a cake, they gnashed on me with their teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O LORD, how long will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, my only one from the lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will give You thanks in the great congregation; I will praise You among a mighty people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let not those who are my lying enemies rejoice over me, those who hate me without cause wink [with] the eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they do not speak peace; but they think deceitful things against the quiet ones of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they widen their mouths against me; they say, Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You have seen, O LORD; do not keep silence; O LORD, do not be far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Stir up Yourself and awaken to my judgment, to my cause, my God and my Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Your righteousness; and do not let them rejoice over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let them not say in their hearts, Aha! Our Soul! Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let them be clothed [with] shame and dishonor together, [those] who magnify themselves over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Let those who delight in my justification shout and rejoice; and they shall say without ceasing, The Lord be magnified, delighting in the peace of His servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness, of Your praise all the day long.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
