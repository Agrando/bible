A Psalm for the sons of Korah. To the Chief Musician. On Mahalath, to make humble. A Poem of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let my prayer come before You; bow down Your ear to my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I am counted with those who go down to the Pit; I am like a feeble man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom You remember no more; and by Your hand they are cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your wrath lies hard on me, and You have afflicted [me] with all Your waves. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You have taken my friends away from me; You have made me a hateful thing to them. [I am] shut up, and I cannot go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My eye mourns because of affliction; O LORD, I have called daily on You; I have stretched out my hands to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For will You do wonders to the dead? Shall the dead rise [and] praise You? Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Shall Your loving-kindness be declared in the grave? [Or] Your faithfulness in ruin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Shall Your wonders be known in the dark, and Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But to You I have cried, O LORD; and in the morning my prayer shall go before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O LORD, why do You cast off my soul?
