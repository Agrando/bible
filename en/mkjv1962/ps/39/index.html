A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways so that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked [are] before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I became dumb, keeping still; I was silent, from good; and my pain was stirred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire burned; I spoke with my tongue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>O LORD, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it [is]; I know how frail I [am].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, You have made my days [as] a handbreadth, and my age [is] as nothing before You. Surely every man standing [is] altogether vanity. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Surely a man walks about like a shadow! Surely they are in an uproar in vain. He heaps up, and does not know who shall gather them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope [is] in You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was dumb, I did not open my mouth; because You have done [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Remove Your stroke away from me; I am destroyed by the blow of Your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You correct a man for iniquity with rebukes, and you make his desires vanish away like a moth. Surely every man [is] vanity. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry. Do not be silent at my tears; for I [am] a stranger with You, a pilgrim, as all my fathers [were].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Look away from me, and I will smile before I go away and be no more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
