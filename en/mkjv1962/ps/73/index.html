Truly God [is] good to Israel, to the pure of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I, my foot had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I was jealous of the proud, [when] I saw the peace of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For [there are] no bands in their death; but their strength [is] fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They [are] not in trouble [like other] men; neither are they plagued like other men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore pride enchains them; violence covers them [like] a robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their eyes stand out with fatness; they have more than the heart could imagine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They scoff and speak in malice of cruelty; from on high they speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore His people return here, and waters of a full [cup are] wrung out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they say, How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these [are] the ungodly, who are at ease in the world; they increase [in] riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Surely I have made my heart pure [in] vain, and washed my hands in innocence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the day long I have been plagued, and chastened every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I would deceive a generation of Your sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I thought deeply in order to understand this, it [was] painful for me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>until I went into the sanctuary of God; [then] I understood their end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down into ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How have they been [brought] into grief, as in a moment! They are fully eaten up with terrors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>like a dream when [one] awakens; so, O LORD, when You awake, You shall despise their image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For my heart was grieved and I was pricked [in] my reins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So foolish [was] I, and I did not know; I was [like] a beast before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I [am] always with You; You have held [me] by my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You shall lead me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me [to] glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom have I in Heaven? And besides You I desire none on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My flesh and my heart fail; [but] God [is] the strength of my heart, and my part forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For lo, those who are far from You shall perish; You have destroyed all who go lusting away from You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I, [it is] good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the LORD God, to declare all Your works.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
