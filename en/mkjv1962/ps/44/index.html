For the sons of Korah, a contemplation. We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work which You did in their days, in the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You drove out the nations [with] Your hand, and planted them; You brought evil on peoples and cast them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For they did not get the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but [it was] Your right hand, and Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You [are] my king, O God; command victories for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Through You we will push our enemies; through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But You have saved us from our enemies, and have put them to shame, those who hated us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In God we boast all the day long, and praise Your name forever. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now You have cast us off, and have shamed us, and You do not go forth with our armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You make us turn back from the adversary; and our haters plunder for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You have given us like sheep [for] food, and have scattered us among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You have sold Your people for nothing, and You did not increase by their price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You make us a curse to our neighbors, a scorn and a mockery to those who are round about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My shame [is] always before me, and the shame of my face has covered me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because of the voice of the slanderer and the blasphemer; before the enemy and avenger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All this has come on us; yet we have not forgotten You nor dealt falsely in Your covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Our heart is not turned back, nor have our steps turned aside from Your way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>though You have crushed us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>shall not God search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea, for Your sake we are put to death all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Awaken! Why do You sleep, O LORD? Arise! Do not cast [us] off forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Why do You hide Your face, [and] forget our affliction and distress?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly holds fast to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Arise [for] our help, and redeem us for the sake of Your mercy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
