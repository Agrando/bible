Give ear, O my people, [to] my law; bow down your ears to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will speak dark sayings of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not hide [them] from their sons, showing to the generations to come the praises of the LORD, and His strength, and His wonderful works that He has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For He set up a testimony in Jacob, and ordered a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, that they should teach them to their sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>so that the generation to come might know; sons shall be born, and they shall arise [and] tell their sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and might not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation [that] did not set their heart aright, and whose spirit was not faithful with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The sons of Ephraim, armed shooters of bows, turned back in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They did not keep the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they forgot His works and His wonders which He had shown them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, [in] the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He divided the sea and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters to stand in a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And in the daytime He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He split the rocks in the wilderness, and let [them] drink, as [from] the great depths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they sinned still more against Him, by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spoke against God; they said, Can God set a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold! He struck the rock so that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can He also give bread? Can He provide flesh for His people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore the LORD heard, and was made furious; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in His salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>though He had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and had rained down manna on them to eat, and He gave them of the grain of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man ate the food of the mighty; He sent them meat to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused an east [wind] to blow in the sky; and by His power He brought in the south [wind].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and He also rained flesh on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and He let [them] fall in the middle of their camp, all around their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they ate, and were filled to the full; for He gave them their own desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were not turned away from their lust, but while their food [was] still in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the wrath of God came on them and killed the fattest of them, and struck down the chosen of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they still sinned, and did not believe because of His wonderful works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore He ended their days in vanity and their years in trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When He killed them, then they looked for Him; and they turned back and sought after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God [was] their rock, and the Most High God was their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they flattered Him with their mouths, and they lied to Him with their tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not right with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But He, full of pity, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy [them]; yea, many times He turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For He remembered that they [were but] flesh, a wind that passes away and does not come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often they provoked Him in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and pained to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They did not remember His hand, the day when He delivered them from the enemy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>how He had set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He turned their rivers into blood, and their floods, [so that] they could not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent different kinds of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He also gave their crops to the stripping locust, and their labor to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with sleet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He gave up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to bolts of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He sent on them the heat of His anger, wrath and fury and trouble, by sending evil angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a way to His anger; He did not save their soul from death, but gave their life over to the plague,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and struck all the first-born in Egypt, the first of the strong in the tents of Ham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and led His people forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea flooded over their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And He brought them within His own holy border, this mountain, [which] His right hand had bought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He also cast out the nations before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tempted and provoked the Most High God, and kept not His testimonies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>but they turned back, and acted unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceiving bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When God heard, He was angry, and turned away from Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>so that He left the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent [which] He placed among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemy's hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He also gave His people over to the sword, and was angry with His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The fire burned up their young men; and their maidens were not given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows were not able to weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awakened like one out of sleep, like a mighty man rejoicing with wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And He drove His enemies backward; He put them to a never-ending shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And He built His holy place like high [palaces], like the earth which He has founded forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He also chose David His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>from following the ewes great with young He brought him to feed Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And he fed them according to the pureness of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
