Will You hide in times of trouble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The wicked in [his] pride persecutes the poor; let them be taken in the plans that they have imagined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, and blesses the covetous [whom] the LORD despises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Through the pride of his face the wicked will not seek [Him]; There [is] no God in all his schemes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His ways are always perverted; Your judgments [are] high, out of his sight. [As for] all his enemies, he puffs at them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved; from generation to generation, never in evil!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud; under his tongue [are] mischief and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He sits in the hiding-places of the villages; in the secret places he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He lies in wait secretly, like a lion in his den. He lies in wait to catch the poor; he catches the poor when he draws him into his net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He crouches and bows, and the poor have fallen by his might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; He hides His face; He will not see forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Your hand; forget not the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why do the wicked condemn God? He has said in his heart, You will not judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You have seen [it]; for You behold mischief and vexation, to repay [it] with Your hand. The poor commits [himself] to You; You are the Helper of the fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Break the arm of the wicked and the evil one; seek out his wickedness, [until] You find none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The LORD [is] King forever and ever; the nations have perished out of His land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will prepare their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, so that the man of the earth may no more terrify.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
