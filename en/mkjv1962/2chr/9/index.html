And she came in to Solomon and spoke with him of all that was in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Solomon told her all her questions. And there was nothing hidden from Solomon which he did not tell her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers and their apparel, and his burnt offerings that he offered up in the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she said to the king, The word that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I did not believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen. And behold, the one half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me.

Because your God loved Israel to establish them forever, therefore He made you king over them to do judgment and justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and an abundance of spices, and precious stones. And there has not been any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And also the servants of Hiram, and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king made terraces to the house of the LORD with the algum trees, and terraces to the king's palace, and lyres and harps for singers.
