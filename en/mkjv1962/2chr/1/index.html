For there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the ark of God David had brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he put the bronze altar which Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made before the tabernacle of the LORD.
