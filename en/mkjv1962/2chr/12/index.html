And the people who came with him out of Egypt [were] without number: Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he took the fortified cities in Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and [to] the rulers of Judah who were gathered to Jerusalem because of Shishak. And [he] said to them, So says the LORD, You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the rulers of Israel and the king humbled themselves. And they said, The LORD [is] righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will give them some deliverance. And My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they shall be his servants, so that they may know My service, and the service of the kings of the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house. He took all. And he carried away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In place of these King Rehoboam made shields of bronze, and gave [them] into the hands of the chief of the guard who kept the entrance of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and carried them and brought them again into the guardroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him so that He would not destroy [him] altogether. And also things went well in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And king Rehoboam strengthened himself at Jerusalem, and reigned. For Rehoboam [was] forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. And his mother's name [was] Naamah the Ammonitess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he did the evil because he did not prepare his heart to seek the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, [are] they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And the wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam [lasted] all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And his son Abijah reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
