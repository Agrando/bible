Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he may depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Ben-hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. And they struck Ijon and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened when Baasha heard, he left off building Ramah, and let his work stop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Asa the king took all Judah. And they carried away the stones of Ramah, and timber with which Baasha was building. And he built with it Geba and Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the LORD your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Were not the Cushites and the Libyans a huge army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro in all the whole earth to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart [is] perfect toward Him. You have done foolishly in this; therefore from now on you shall have wars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Asa was angry with the seer and put him in a prison-house. For [he was] in a rage with him because of this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they [are] written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa [was] diseased in his feet, until his disease [was] very grievous. Yet in his disease he did not seek to the LORD, but to the physicians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Asa slept with his fathers and died in the forty-first year of his reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers art. And they made a very great burning for him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
