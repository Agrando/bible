His mother's name also [was] Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he did the right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he went out and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities around Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal, and the Meunites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah. And his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt, for he was made very strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate, and at the Turning, and fortified them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he built towers in the desert, and dug many wells. For he had many cattle, both in the low country and in the plains. He [also] had husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains, and in Carmel. For he loved the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, Uzziah had an army of making war, going out to war by troops, according to the number of their oversight by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, [one] of the king's leaders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The whole number of the heads of the fathers of the mighty men of power [was] two thousand and six hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And under their hand [was] an army of three hundred and seven thousand, five hundred, that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Uzziah prepared for them, for all the army, shields and spears and helmets and coats of armor and bows and stones for the slings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he made engines in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones with. And his name spread far abroad. For he was wonderfully helped until he was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to ruin. For he sinned against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the LORD, mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they withstood Uzziah the king and said to him, [It is] not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord, but to the priests, the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the temple, for you have sinned. Nor shall it be for your honor from the LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Uzziah was angry. And he [had] a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him. And, behold, he [was] leprous in his forehead! And they thrust him out from there. Yes, he himself hurried to go out also, because the LORD had stricken him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Uzziah the king was a leper until the day of his death, and lived in a separate house a leper. For he was cut off from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son [was] over the king's house, judging the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial of the kings. For they said, He [is] a leper. And his son Jotham reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
