And his son Asa reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Asa did the good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For he took away the altars of the strange [gods], and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the Asherahs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He also took out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images. And the kingdom was quiet before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he built fortified cities in Judah. For the land had rest, and he had no war in those years, because the LORD had given him rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to Judah, Let us build these cities and make walls around [them], and towers, gates and bars, while the land [is] still before us. Because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought, and He has given us rest on every side. And they built and were blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Asa had an army which bore bucklers and spears, three hundred thousand out of Judah. And out of Benjamin there [were] two hundred and eighty thousand who bore shields and drew bows; all these mighty men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men, and three hundred chariots. And he came to Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in order in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Asa cried to the LORD his God and said, LORD, [it is] nothing with You to help, whether with many or with him who has no power. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rest on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God. Do not let man prevail against You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD struck the Cushites before Asa and before Judah. And the Cushites fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Asa and the people with him pursued them to Gerar. And the Cushites fell, for none was left alive of them. For they were destroyed before the LORD and before His army. And they carried away very much plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD came on them. And they plundered all the cities, for there was very much plunder in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they struck the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
