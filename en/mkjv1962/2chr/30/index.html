For not many [of them] had done as it was written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the runners went with the letters from the king and his rulers to Israel and Judah, and according to the command of the king, saying, O sons of Israel, turn again to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped out of the hands of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And do not be like your fathers and like your brothers who sinned against the LORD God of their fathers, and He made them for a horror, as you see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And do not be stiffnecked like your fathers. Yield yourselves to the LORD and enter into His temple which He has sanctified forever. And serve the LORD your God, so that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For if you turn again to the LORD, your brothers and your sons will have mercies before those who lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land. For the LORD your God [is] gracious and merciful, and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the runners passed from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun. But they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>However, men from Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the command of the king and of the rulers, by the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And many people gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened [Bread] in the second month, a very great congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they arose and took away the altars in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away, and threw [them] into the torrent Kidron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they killed the Passover on the fourteenth of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed and made themselves pure, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they stood in their place in their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood from the hand of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For many in the congregation [were] not sanctified. And the Levites were over the killing of the passovers for every one [who was] not clean, to sanctify them to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For many of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not been cleansed, but ate the Passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, May the good LORD pardon everyone</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[who] prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Israel found at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened [Bread] seven days with great gladness. And the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day with loud instruments to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the LORD. And they ate the appointed things seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the whole gathering agreed to keep another seven days. And they kept [another] seven days with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep. And the rulers gave to the congregation a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. And a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there was great joy in Jerusalem. For from the days of Solomon the son of David the king of Israel [there was] nothing like this in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people. And their voice was heard, and their prayer came to His holy dwelling-place, to Heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
