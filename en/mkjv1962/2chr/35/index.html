And they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth of the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. [It shall] not [be] a burden on your shoulders. And serve the LORD your God and His people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and prepare by the houses of your fathers, according to your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And stand in the holy [place] according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brothers, the sons of the people, and the division of the families of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And kill the passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brothers so that [they] may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Josiah gave to the people from the flock, lambs and kids, all for the Passover offerings, for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand oxen. These [were] from what the king owned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his rulers offered to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand, six hundred [sheep], and three hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Conaniah, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for Passover offerings five thousand [sheep] and five hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king's command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they killed the passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled from their hands, and the Levites skinned [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they removed the burnt offerings so that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer to the LORD, as [it is] written in the book of Moses; and so they did to the oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they roasted the passover lamb with fire according to the law. But the holy [offerings] they boiled in pots, and in kettles, and in pans, and carried to all the sons of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were offering up the burnt offerings and the fat until nightfall. And the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the singers, the sons of Asaph [were] in their place, according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's seer. And the gatekeepers [were] at every gate. It was not for them to depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of king Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened [Bread] seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet. Yea, none of the kings of Israel kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were found, and the people of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This Passover was kept in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates. And Josiah went out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with you, king of Judah? [I do] not [come] against you today, but against the house [with which] I have war. For God commanded me to make haste. You must cease from [opposing] God, who [is] with me, so that He does not destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself so that he might fight with him. And he did not listen to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the archers shot at king Josiah. And the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am grievously wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his servants took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jeremiah mourned for Josiah. And all the singing men and the singing women have spoken of Josiah in their lamentations until this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel. And behold, they [are] written in the Lamentations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, [are] according as it [is] written in the law of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and his deeds, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
