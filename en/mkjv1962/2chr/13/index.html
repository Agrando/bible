His mother's name also [was] Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abijah set the battle in order with an army of mighty men of war, four hundred thousand chosen men. Jeroboam also set the battle in order against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abijah stood up on mount Zemaraim, in the hills of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Should you not know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, has risen up and has rebelled against his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there are gathered to him vain men, the sons of Belial, and have made themselves strong against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, and Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hands of the sons of David. And you [are] a great multitude, and there [are] with you golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have you not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made priests to yourselves like the peoples of the lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, he may be a priest of [those who are] no gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But as for us, Jehovah [is] our God, and we have not forsaken Him. And the priests who minister to the LORD are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they burn to the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense, and the showbread on the pure table, and the lampstand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening. For we keep the charge of the LORD our God. But you have forsaken Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And behold, God Himself [is] with us as Commander, and His priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come around behind them, so that they were in front of Judah, and the ambush [was] behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah turned, and, behold, the battle [was] before and behind. And they cried to the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men of Judah shouted. And it happened as the men of Judah shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sons of Israel fled before Judah. And God delivered them into their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter. And there fell down dead five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Israel were humbled at that time, and the sons of Judah won because they relied on the LORD God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages, and Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jeroboam did not recover strength again [in] the days of Abijah. And the LORD struck him and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abijah became mighty, and married fourteen wives, and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, [are] written in the inquiry of the prophet Iddo.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
