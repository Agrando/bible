He also practiced secret arts, and used fortune-telling, and used witchcraft, and dealt with mediums, and with soothsayers. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD in order to provoke Him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nor will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have set apart for your fathers; only if they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Manasseh made Judah and the people of Jerusalem to err, to do worse than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and to His people, but they would not listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD brought on them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh among the thorns and bound him with chains and carried him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he was in affliction, he sought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he prayed to Him, and He was entreated of him, and heard his prayer, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that Jehovah [is] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after this he built a wall outside the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance of the Fish Gate, and went around Ophel, and raised it to a very great height. And he put army commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and threw [them] out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he repaired the altar of the LORD and sacrificed on it peace offerings and thank-offerings. And he commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the people still sacrificed in the high places, [but only] to the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they [are written] in the Book of the Kings of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and his prayer, and his entreaty, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places and set up Asherahs and graven images, before he was humbled, behold, they [are] written among the Matters of the Seers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And his son Amon reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Amon [was] twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did; and to all the graven images that his father Manasseh had made, Amon sacrificed, and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And [he] did not bow before the LORD, like the humbling of his father Manasseh. For Amon himself multiplied guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the people of the land killed all those who conspired against king Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah to reign in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
