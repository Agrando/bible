And in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherahs, and the carved images, and the molten images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence. And he cut down the images which [were] on high above them, and the Asherahs. And the carved images and the molten images he also broke in pieces and made dust [from them, and scattered on the graves of the ones who had sacrificed to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he burned the bones of the priests on their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And [so he did] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their tools round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he broke down the altars and the Asherahs, and had beaten the carved images into powder, and cut down all the idols in all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and they delivered the silver that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin, and they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they put [it] in the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD. And they gave it [to] the workmen who worked in the house of the LORD, to repair and mend the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They gave to the artisans and builders, to buy cut stone and timber for joints, and beams to build up the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men did the work faithfully. And the overseers of them [were] Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, and of the Levites, all who [were] skillful with instruments of music;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and over the bearers of burdens, and overseers of all who worked the work in any manner of service. And of the Levites [were] scribes and officers and gatekeepers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they brought out the silver that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD by Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Shaphan carried the Book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was given into the hands of your servants, they are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they poured out the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it happened when the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan. and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found. For great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD to do according to all that is written in this Book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hilkiah, and those of the king, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the robes. (And she lived in Jerusalem in the second [part].) And they spoke to her about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she answered them, So says the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man who sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil on this place and upon its people, all the curses that are written in the Book which they have read before the king of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>because they have forsaken Me, and have burned incense to other gods, so that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. And My wrath shall be poured out on this place and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall you say to him, So says the LORD God of Israel whose words you have heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because your heart [was] tender and you humbled yourself before your God when you heard His words against this place and against its people, and humbled yourself before Me, and tore your garments and wept before Me, I have even heard also, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, nor shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place and upon its people. And they brought the king word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the people of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people from the great to [the] small. And he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep His commandments and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he caused all who were found in Jerusalem and in Benjamin, and the people of Jerusalem, to stand to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the territories that [belonged] to the sons of Israel. And he made all that were present in Israel to serve, to serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not depart from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
