I got men singers and women singers for myself, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and very many wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my part of all my labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit; and [there is] no profit under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I turned to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what [can] the man [do] who comes after the king, when they have already done it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walks in darkness; and I also knew that one event happens to all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, [so] it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? And I said in my heart that this also [is] vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For [there is] no memory of the wise [more than] of the fool forever, since that which is now shall all be forgotten in the days to come. And how does the wise die above the fool!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun [is] sad to me; for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun; that I must leave it to the man who shall be after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knows [whether] he shall be wise or a fool? Yet he shall have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and acted wisely under the sun. This [is] also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I turned to cause my heart to despair over all the labor which I did under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with success; yet to a man who has not labored in it, he shall leave it [for] his share. This also is vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what has man from all his labor, and from the troubling of his heart, in which he has labored under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days [are] sorrows, and his labor sadness; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This [is] also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Is it not good that he should eat and drink and make his soul see good in his labor? This I also saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who can eat, or who can enjoy, apart from me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For [God] gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy to a man who [is] good in His sight. But to the sinner He gives labor, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him who is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
