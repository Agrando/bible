For they do not know that they are doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Do not be rash [with] your mouth, and do not let your heart be hasty to say a word before God. For God [is] in Heaven, and you [are] on earth; therefore let your words be few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For a dream comes through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice by the multitude of words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When you vow a vow to God, do not wait to pay it. For He has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you have vowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[it is] better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; do not say before the angel that it [was] an error. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For in the multitude of dreams, both words and vanities abound; but fear God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, do not marvel at the matter. For He [who is] higher than the highest watches; and there are some higher than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the advantage of a land, it is for all; [even] a king has a field being tilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver, and he who loves abundance not with] gain. This [is] also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the good thing increases, those who eat it increase; then what profit [is it] to its owners, except to see [it] with their eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sleep of a laboring man [is] sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is a sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for their owners to their hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But those riches perish by evil use. And he brings forth a son, and nothing [is] in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As he came forth from his mother's womb naked, he shall return to go as he came. And from his labor he may not carry anything that may go in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this also [is] a sore evil, [that] in all, as he came, so shall he go; and what profit does he have who has labored for the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also all his days he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath [with] his sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold that which I have seen. [it is] good and right for one to eat and to drink, and to see good in all his labor that he labors under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him; for it [is] his portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this [is] the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God answers [him] in the joy of his heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
