And behold the tears of the oppressed ones, and they had no comforter! And on the side of those who oppressed them there [was] power, but they had no comforter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I commended the dead who already have died, more than the living who [are] living now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yea, better than both [is he] who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again, I considered all labor, and every right work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better [is] a hand filled with rest than two fists [with] travail and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There is one [alone], and [there is] not a second; yea, he has neither son nor brother; yet there is no end to all his labor; and his eyes are not satisfied with riches; and [he says, For whom do I labor and take good from my soul? This [is] also vanity. Yes, it [is] an evil business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him [who is] alone when he falls, for he does not have another to help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Again, if two lie [together], then they have warmth; but how can one be warm [alone] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if one overthrows him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A poor and a wise child [is] better than an old and foolish king, who will not be warned any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For out of prison he comes to reign; although in his kingdom he was born poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I saw all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child who shall stand up in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[There is] no end of all the people, of all who have been before them; they also who come after shall not rejoice in him.
