And they sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it happened from the day the ark [began] to dwell in Kirjath-jearim, the days became many; yea, they were twenty years. And all the house of Israel yearned after the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel saying, If you return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve Him only. And He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sons of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they were gathered to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the sons of Israel in Mizpeh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had come together to Mizpeh. And the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And the sons of Israel heard, and they were afraid of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, Do not cease from crying to the LORD our God for us, so that He will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered a whole burnt offering to the LORD. And Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened [as] Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great noise on that day on the Philistines, and troubled them. And they were beaten before Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them as far as below Beth-car.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel took a stone and set [it] between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, The LORD has helped us until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Philistines were beaten, and they did not come any more into the border of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were given back to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath. And Israel delivered its borders out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he went from year to year in a circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpeh, and judged Israel [in] all those places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And his return [was] to Ramah, for his house [was] there. And he judged Israel there. And he built an altar there to the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
