And Achish said to David, You surely know that you shall go with me to battle, you and your men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David said to Achish, Surely you shall know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, And I will make you keeper of my head forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned him and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away the mediums and the spirit-knowers out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Philistines gathered themselves and came and pitched in Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel and they pitched in Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Saul saw the army of the Philistines, and he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul said to his servants, Seek me a woman who is] a medium, so that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servant said to him, Behold, [there is] a woman who is] a medium, at Endor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing. And he went. And two men went with him. And they came to the woman by night. And he said, Please divine for me [calling up the dead], and bring me up the man whom I shall name to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off mediums, and the spirit-knowers, out of the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, [As] the LORD lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to you? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the woman saw Samuel, and cried with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? For you [are] Saul!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king said to her, Do not be afraid. For what did you see? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods coming up out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to her, What [is] his form? And she said, An old man comes up, and he is covered with a cloak. And Saul saw that it was Samuel, and [he] bowed [his] face to the ground, and prostrated himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am grievously distressed, for the Philistines are warring against me. And God has left me and does not answer me any more, neither by prophets nor by dreams. And I have called you so that you may make known to me what I should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samuel said, Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has left you and has become your enemy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD has done for Himself as He spoke by me. For the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and [is] giving it to your neighbor, to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD, nor execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines. And tomorrow you and your sons [shall be] with me. The LORD also shall deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul immediately fell headlong on the earth, and was sorely afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all day nor all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was sorely troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a bit of bread before you and eat, so that you may have strength when you go on your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, forced him, and the woman also. And he listened to their voices and arose from the earth and sat on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman had a fat calf in the house. And she hurried and killed it, and took flour and kneaded [it], and baked unleavened [bread] with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And [she] brought [it] before Saul, and before his servants. And they ate, and rose up and went away that night.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
