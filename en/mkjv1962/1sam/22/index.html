And his brothers and all his father's house heard, and went down to him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And every man in distress, and every man who had a creditor, and every man bitter of soul, gathered themselves to him. And he became commander over them. And about four hundred men were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, Please let my father and my mother come forth [and be] with you until I know what God will do for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he brought them before the king of Moab. And they lived with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not stay in the stronghold. Leave and go into the land of Judah. And David left and came into the forest of Hareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul heard that David and the men with him had been discovered. And Saul was staying in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand. And all his servants were standing about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul said to his servants standing by him, Now hear, Benjamites, will the son of Jesse give to any of you fields and vineyards, [and] make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But all of you have conspired against me, and none of you was revealing [in] my ear when my son cut [a covenant] with the son of Jesse? And not one of you is sorry for me, even [to reveal in my ear that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he asked of the LORD for him and gave him food and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests in Nob. And they came, all of them, to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I [am], my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have asked of God for him, that he should rise against me to lie in wait, as at this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who [is so] faithful among all your servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and [who] goes at your bidding, and who is honorable in your house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Have I today begun to ask of God for him? Be it far from me. Do not let the king charge a thing to his servant, nor to all the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing of all this, more or less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king said, Ahimelech, you shall surely die, you and all your father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king said to the guard that stood around him, Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also [is] with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not reveal it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall on the priests of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king said to Doeg, You turn and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned and fell on the priests. And on that day he killed eighty-five persons who wore a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and babes, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite [was] there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have caused the death of all the persons of your father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Stay with me, and do not fear. For he who seeks my life seeks your life. But you [shall be] in safekeeping with me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
