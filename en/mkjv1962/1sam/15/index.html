And now listen to the voice of the words of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So says the LORD of hosts, I will visit Amalek with what he did to Israel, how he set against him in the way when he came up from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now go and strike Amalek, and completely destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Saul came to a city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul said to the Kenites, Go! Depart! Get down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul struck the Amalekites from Havilah, as you come to Shur, which [is] over across from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive. And he completely destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs, and all [that was] good, and would not completely destroy them. But everything  that was] vile and feeble they completely destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the word of the LORD came to Samuel saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It repents Me that I have set up Saul [to be] king. For he has turned back from following Me and has not done My commands. And it grieved Samuel, and he cried [out to] the LORD all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Samuel rose up early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told to Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a place for himself, and has gone around and passed on and gone down to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul. And Saul said to him, You [are] blessed of the LORD. I have done the command of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, What then [is] this bleating of the flock in my ears? And [what is] the sound of the herd which I hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites. For the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God. And the rest we have completely destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Stop! And I will tell you what the LORD has said to me tonight. And he said to him, Speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, When you [were] little in your own sight, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed you king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD sent you on the way and said, Go and completely destroy the sinners, Amalek, and fight against them until you destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you fly on the spoil and do evil in the sight of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took from the spoil, of [the] flocks and herd, [the] best of the things devoted to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said, Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice! To listen [is] better than the fat of rams!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion [is as] the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idol-worship. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from being king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned. For I have disobeyed the command of the LORD, and your word, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now please pardon my sin and turn again with me so that I may worship the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Samuel turned around to go, and he laid hold on the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said to him, The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours [who is] better than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent, for He [is] not a man that He should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, I have sinned. Please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and turn again with me. And I shall worship the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Samuel turned again after Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Samuel said, Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him daintily. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Samuel went to Ramah. And Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel never again saw Saul until the day of his death, for Samuel mourned for Saul. And the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
