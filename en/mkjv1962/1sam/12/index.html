And I am old and gray-headed, and, behold, my sons [are] with you. And I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, here I [am]. Witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose ass have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I received a bribe, to blind my eyes with it? And I will restore it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said, You have not defrauded us nor oppressed us, neither have you taken from any man's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, The LORD [is] witness against you, and His anointed [is] witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Samuel said to the people, [It is] the LORD who made Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now stand still, so that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did to you and to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them live in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they forgot the LORD their God. And He sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served the Baals and Ashtoreths. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us, even though the LORD your God [was] your King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, behold the king whom you have chosen, whom you have desired! And behold, the LORD has set a king over you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you will fear the LORD, and serve Him, and listen to His voice, and not rebel against the command of the LORD, then both you and also the king who reigns over you shall continue following the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you will not listen to the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the command of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD shall be against you as [it was] against your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also, now stand and see this great thing which the LORD shall do before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Is it] not wheat harvest today? I will call to the LORD, and He shall send thunder and rain, so that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, that which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking a king for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel called to the LORD, And the LORD sent thunder and rain that day. And all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, so that we will not die. For we have added evil to all our sins, to ask a king for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samuel said to the people, Do not fear. You have done all this wickedness. Yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And do not turn aside to go after vanities, which cannot profit nor deliver. For they [are] vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the LORD will not forsake His people for His great name's sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Also, I, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD from ceasing to pray for you. But I will teach you the good and the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only fear the LORD, and serve Him in truth with all your heart. For consider what great [things] He has done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if you shall still do wickedly, both you and your king, will be swept away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
