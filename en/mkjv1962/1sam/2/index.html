My mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in Your salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>[There is] none holy as the LORD, for there is none beside You. Neither [is there] any rock like our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Talk no more so very proudly. Remove arrogance out of your mouth, for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The bows of the mighty [are] broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[They that were] full have hired themselves out for bread, and they that were hungry ceased; yea, while the barren has borne seven, and she who had many sons has languished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The LORD kills and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The LORD takes away, and He gives riches; He brings low; yea, He lifts up high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He raises up the poor out of the dust; He lifts up the needy from the dunghill to set [them] among princes; yea, He causes them to inherit a throne of honor; for to the LORD [are] the pillars of the earth; and He sets the habitable world on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He keeps the feet of his saints, and the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The foes of the LORD shall be broken to pieces. He thunders in the heavens upon them. The LORD shall judge the ends of the earth. And He shall give strength to His king, and exalts the horn of His anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child served the LORD before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial. They did not know the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priests' custom with the people [was]: If any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And [he] stuck [it] into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. All that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yea, before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest. For he will not have boiled flesh from you, but raw!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And [if] any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat at once, and then take as your soul desires, then he would answer him, No! But you shall give now! And if not, I will take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD. For men despised the offering of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel served before the LORD, a child girded [with] a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And his mother made him a little coat, and brought [it] to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, May the LORD give you seed of this woman for the loan which is loaned to the LORD. And they went to their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD visited Hannah so that she conceived, and she bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who gathered [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings by all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No, my sons, for [it is] no good report that I hear. You make the LORD's people to transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one man sins against another, the judge shall judge him. But if a man sins against the LORD, who shall plead for him? But they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the LORD desired to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the child Samuel went on [growing] both in stature and in good [looks], both with the LORD and also with men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, So says the LORD: Did I plainly appear to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel [to be] My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? And did I give to the house of your father all the offerings made by fire from the sons of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering, which I have commanded [in My] house? [Do you] honor your sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the LORD God of Israel says, I said indeed, Your house and the house of your father should walk before Me forever. But now the LORD says, Be it far from Me! For those who honor Me I will honor, and those that think little of Me shall be lightly regarded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days come when I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father's house, so that no old man shall be in your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall see an adversary [in My] house, in all the good which he does with Israel. And there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And that man of yours [whom] I shall not cut off from My altar, shall be left in order to make your eyes fail, and to grieve your heart. And all the increase of your house shall die [young] men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this [shall be] a sign to you, which shall come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day both of them shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will raise up a faithful priest to Myself, one who shall do according to what [is] in My heart and in My mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it shall be that everyone who is left in your house shall come [and] bow down to him for a piece of silver and a piece of bread. And [they] shall say, Please put me into one of the priests' offices so that I may eat a piece of bread.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
