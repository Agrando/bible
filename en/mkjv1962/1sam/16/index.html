Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse of Bethlehem. For I have seen a king for Me among his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul hears, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take a heifer of the herd in your hand with you and say, I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. And you shall anoint for Me whomever I name to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samuel did what the LORD said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said, Do you come peaceably?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said, Peaceably. I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it happened as they came in, he saw Eliab and said, Surely the LORD's anointed [is] before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the LORD said to Samuel, Do not look on his face, nor on his height, because I have refused him. For He does not see as man sees. For man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesse called Abinadab, and he passed him before Samuel, but he said, Also the LORD has not chosen this one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jesse passed Shammah by, but he said, Also the LORD has not chosen this one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesse passed seven of his sons before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD has not chosen these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said to Jesse, Are all the young men here? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sent and brought him in. And he [was] ruddy, with beautiful eyes and good form. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him. For this is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God terrifies you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let our lord now command his servants before you to seek out a man who knows to play on a harp. And it shall be, when the evil spirit from God is on you, then he shall play [with] his hand, and [it shall be] well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said to his servants, Now look for me a man who can play well, and bring [him] to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And one of the servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, and a mighty warrior and a man of battle, and prudent in speech. And he is a person of good form, and the LORD [is with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me your son David, who [is] with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesse took an ass [loaded] with bread and a skin of wine and a kid, and sent [them] by David his son to Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to Saul and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul sent to Jesse saying, Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it happened when the spirit from God was on Saul, that David took a harp and played with his hand. And there was relief for Saul, and [it was] well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
