And there was not a man among the sons of Israel more handsome than he, being taller than any of the people from his shoulder and upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Please take one of the servants with you and rise, and go look for the asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find [them]. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, and nothing there. And he passed through the land of Benjamin, but they did not find [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they came to the land of Zuph, and Saul said to his servant who [was] with him, Come and let us return lest my father quit [caring] for the asses, and be anxious about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to him, Behold now, in this city [is] a man of God, and an honorable man. All that he says surely comes to pass. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can declare our way to us, how to go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said to his young man, But behold, [if] we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our vessels is gone, and [there is] no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the young man answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have found the fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God to tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(In the old days in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said this: Come, let us go to the seer, for the prophet of today was before called a seer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul said to his young man, Your word is good. Come, let us go. So they went into the city where the man of God [was].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[As] they went up the hill to the city, they found young women going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they answered them and said, He is. Behold, [he is] before you. Hurry now, for he came today to the city, for [there is] a feast of the people today in the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As you come to the city, you shall immediately find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the feast. Afterwards those who have been invited eat. And now go up, for about this time you shall find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they went up into the city. When they had come into the middle of the city, behold, Samuel came out to meet them, to go up to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin. And you shall anoint him [to be] leader over My people Israel, so that he may save My people out of the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked on My people because their cry has come to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to you! This [one] shall reign over My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate and said, Please tell me where the seer's house [is].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul and said, I [am] the seer. Go up before me to the high place. For you shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as to the asses [which were] lost to you three days ago, do not set your mind on them. For they are found. And on whom [is] all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you and on all your father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul answered and said, [Am] I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And [is] not my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak so to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them into the room, and gave them a place at the head of the invited ones, about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said to the cook, Bring that part which I gave you, [of] which I said to you, Set it beside you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the shoulder and that on it, and set [it] before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is reserved! Set [it] before you [and] eat. For until this set time it has been kept for you, since I said, I have invited the people. And Saul ate with Samuel that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they came down from the high place into the city, and he spoke with Saul on the top of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arose early. And it happened about the spring of the day that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, so that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and both of them went out, he and Samuel outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were going down to the end of the city, and Samuel said to Saul, Tell the servant to pass on before us and pass on. And you stand still awhile, so that I may cause you to hear the word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
