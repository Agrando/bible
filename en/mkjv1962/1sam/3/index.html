And the word of the LORD was rare in those days. [There was] no open vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it happened at that time, when Eli [was] lying down in his place, and his eyes began to become dim so that he could not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the lamp of God had not gone out. And Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the LORD called Samuel. And he answered, Here [am] I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here [am] I. For you called me. And he said, I did not call. Go and lie down again. And he went to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, Here [am] I, for you called me. And he answered, I did not call, my son. Go back, lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD called Samuel again, the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, Here [am] I, for you called me. And Eli saw that the LORD had called the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if [One] calls you, you shall say, Speak, LORD, for Your servant hears. And Samuel went to lie down in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD came and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel! Then Samuel answered, Speak, for Your servant hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day I will confirm to Eli all that which I have spoken as to his house, beginning and making an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile and he did not restrain them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel lay until morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here [am] I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, What [is] the word which He has said to you? Please do not hide [it] from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide a thing from me of all the words that He said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It [is] the LORD; let Him do what seems good to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel [was] established to be a prophet of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh. For the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
