And Saul went in to cover his feet. And David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the men of David said to him, Behold, this is the day of which the LORD said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand so that you may do to him as it shall seem good to you. And David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened afterward David's heart struck him because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to his men, Far be it from me, by the LORD, if I will do this thing to my lord, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, since he is the anointed of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David held back his men with words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave and went on [his] way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David arose afterward and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king! And Saul looked behind him. And David bowed his face to the earth and prostrated himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Saul, Why do you hear man's words, saying, Behold, David seeks to do you evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, your eyes have seen today how the LORD had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. And [one] said to kill you. But [I] had pity on you. And I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD's anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, my father, behold! Yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand. For in that I cut off the skirt of your robe and did not kill you, know and see that [there is] neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you. Yet you hunt my soul to take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May the LORD judge between me and you, and may the LORD avenge me of you. But my hand shall not be on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As the ancient proverb says, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked. But my hand shall not be on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog? After a flea?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>May the LORD therefore be judge, and judge between you and me, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it happened when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, [Is] this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to David, You [are] more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, but I have rewarded you evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me, because when the LORD shut me up into your hand, you did not kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go completely away? And may the LORD reward good for what you have done to me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, behold, I know well that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall he established in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And swear therefore to me before the LORD that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men went up into the hold.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
