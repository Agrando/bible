And Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why [are] you alone, and no man with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business and has said to me, Let no man know anything [of] the business about which I send you, and what I have sent you. And I have sent servants to such and such a place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And therefore, what is under your hand? Give five [loaves] of bread in my hand, or what there is to be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the priest answered David and said, [There is] no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David answered the priest and said to him, Truly women [have been] kept from us for about three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and [in] a way the holy [bread] is common. Also surely today it is sanctified in the vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest gave him holy [bread]. For there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence that was taken from before the LORD, in order to put hot bread in on the day when it was taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And a man from the servants of Saul [was] there that day, held before the LORD. And his name [was] Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under your hand spear or sword? For I have not brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business needed haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it [is] wrapped in a cloth under the ephod, if you will take, take it for yourself, for there is no other here except that one. And David said, There is none like that. Give it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the servants of Achish said to him, [Is] not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he changed his behavior before them, and pretended himself to be mad in their hands, and marked on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Achish said to his servants, Lo, you see the man is mad. Why have you brought him to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do I have need of mad men, that you have brought this one to show madness in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
