Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the thing was evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you. For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even until this day-- works] with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods-- so they do also to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now listen to their voice. Only, you shall surely protest solemnly to them, and show them the kind of king who shall reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who asked a king of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, This will be the privilege of the king who shall reign over you. He shall take your sons and appoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and his horsemen. And they shall run before his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And [he] will appoint commanders over thousands, and commanders over fifties, and some to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and make his weapons of war and weapons for his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he will take your daughters [to be] perfumers and cooks and bakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will take your fields and your vineyards and your olive-yards, the best, and give [them] to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give [it] to his eunuchs and to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will take your male slaves and your slave girls, and your finest young men, and your asses, and put [them] to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He will take the tenth of your sheep, and you shall be his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the LORD will not answer you in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel. And they said, No, but we will have a king over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we shall be, also we, like all the nations, so that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Every man go to his city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
