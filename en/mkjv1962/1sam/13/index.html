Two thousand of these were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And of the rest of the people he sent each man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines in Geba, and the Philistines heard. And Saul blew the ram's horn throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all Israel heard, saying, Saul has struck a garrison of the Philistines, and also Israel has made himself stink to the Philistines. And the people were called to Gilgal after Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Philistines gathered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people like the sand on the seashore in multitude. And they came up and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the men of Israel saw that they were in a tight place (for the people were distressed). And the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. And Saul [was] still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him, trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he waited seven days, according to the set time with Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal. And the people were scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Saul said, Bring a burnt offering here to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him and to kneel to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and you did not come in the days appointed, and the Philistines gathered themselves at Michmash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I said, The Philistines will come down now on me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD. And I forced myself and offered a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you. For now the LORD would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now your kingdom shall not stand. The LORD has sought Him a man after His own heart, and the LORD has appointed him to be leader over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people present with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul, and his son Jonathan, and the people present with them, stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin. But the Philistines camped in Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned to the way [to] Ophrah, to the land of Shual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another company turned the way [to] Beth-horon. And one company turned the way of the border that looks toward the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel. For the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But all the Israelites went down [to] the Philistines, each man to sharpen his plowshare, and his mattock, and his axe, and his coulter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there was the [charge] of a pim for the plowshares, and for the mattocks, and for the three-pronged forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the plowshares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it happened in the day of battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan. But with Saul and with his son Jonathan there [was] found [sword and spear].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
