And Jonathan told David, saying, My father Saul seeks to kill you. And now please be careful until morning, and stay in a secret [place], and hide yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you [are], and I will talk about you with my father. And I will tell you what I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Do not let the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his works [are] very good toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the LORD worked out a great salvation for all Israel. You saw and rejoiced! Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan. And Saul swore, [As] the LORD lives, he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was war again. And David went out and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter. And they fled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the evil spirit from the LORD was on Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David played with [his] hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul thought to strike David even to the wall with the spear. But he burst forth from Saul's presence, and he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saul also sent messengers to David's house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And David's wife Michal told him saying, If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you shall be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Michal let David down through a window. And he left and hurried away, and escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Michal took an image and laid [it] in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' [hair] at its head, and covered it with a cloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He [is] sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed so that I may kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the messengers came in, and behold, the image [was] in the bed with a pillow of goats' [hair] at its head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me so, and sent away my enemy so that he has escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel, to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it was told to Saul, saying, Behold, David [is] at Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing [as] appointed over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers the third time, and they prophesied also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he also went to Ramah, and came to a great well in Sechu. And he asked and said, Where [are] Samuel and David? And [one] said, Behold, at Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God was on him also, and going on he went and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel, even he. And he lay down disrobed all that day and all that night. Because of this they say, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
