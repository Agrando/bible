What [is] my iniquity, and what my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said to him, Far be it. You shall not die! Behold, my father will do nothing either great or small that he will not show to me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It [is] not [so].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David swore again and said, Your father certainly knows that I have found grace in your eyes. And he said, Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be full of sorrow. But truly [as] the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, only a step [is] between me and death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jonathan said to David, Whatever your soul desires, I will even do for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said to Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow [is] the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go so that I may hide myself in the field until the third day at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If your father misses me at all, then say, David earnestly asked me that he might run to his city Bethlehem. For [there is] a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If he says so, [It is] well, peace [will be] to your servant, but if he is very angry, be sure that evil is determined by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is any iniquity in me, kill me yourself. For why should you bring me to your father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jonathan said, Far be it from you. For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come on you, then would I not tell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then David said to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? Or what [if] your father answers you roughly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go into the field. And both of them went out into the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jonathan said to David, By the LORD, the God of Israel, when I search my father about this time tomorrow [or] the third [day], behold, [if there is] good toward David, then shall I not send to you and reveal [it in your ear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So may the LORD do to Jonathan and more if it seem good to my father [to do] you evil, then I will reveal [it] in your ear and send you away, and you may go in peace. And may the LORD be with you, as He was with my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall not only show me the kindness of the LORD while I still live, so that I do not die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David, every one, from the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jonathan covenanted with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require [it] at the hand of David's enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him. For he loved him as he loved his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow [is] the new moon. And you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And on the third [day] you shall quickly come down and shall come there to the place where you were hidden in the day of the deed. And [you] shall remain near the stone Ezel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will shoot three arrows on the side, as though I shot at a mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And behold, I will send a lad, [saying], Go find the arrows. If I carefully say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them, then you may come, for there is peace to you, and no hurt, [as] the LORD lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I say this to the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond you, go your way, for the LORD has sent you away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And [as to] the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, may the LORD be between you and me forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon had come, the king sat down by the food to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king sat on his seat as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Saul did not speak anything that day. For he thought, Something has happened to him; he [is] not clean. Surely he [is] not clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it happened on the next day, the second of the month, David's place was empty. And Saul said to his son Jonathan, Why does the son of Jesse not come to the meal, neither yesterday nor today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked of me [to go] to Bethlehem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and he said, Please send me away, for we have a family sacrifice in the city. And my brother commanded me [to be] there. And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, I pray you let me get away and see my brothers. And he does not come to the king's table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse, rebellious [woman], do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. And now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, Why shall he be killed? What has he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul threw a spear at him to strike him, and by this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon. For he was grieved for David, because his father had put him to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it happened, in the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David. And a little lad [was] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to this lad, Run now, find the arrows which I shoot. As the lad ran, he shot an arrow, causing it to pass over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad and said, [Is] not the arrow beyond you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Hurry, make haste, do not stand. And Jonathan's lad gathered the arrow and came to his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the lad did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, Go, bring [to] the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>As soon as the lad had gone, David rose from the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. And they kissed one another, and wept with one another, until David exceeded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace because we have both sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, The Lord shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he rose and went away. And Jonathan went [into] the city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
