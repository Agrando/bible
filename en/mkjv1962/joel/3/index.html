And I will fight with them there for My people and for My inheritance Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and divided My land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they have cast lots for My people, and have given a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, so that they might drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yea, and what [have] you to do with Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the borders of Philistia? [Will you] give Me a reward? And if you reward Me, swiftly and speedily I will turn your reward on your own head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because you have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried My good treasures into your temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have also sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, that you might remove them far from their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I [am] rising them out of the place where you have sold them, and will turn your reward on your own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off; for the LORD has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, I [am] strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Gather yourselves and come, all you nations, and gather yourselves together all around; cause Your mighty ones to come down there, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let the nations be awakened and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the nations all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, come down; for the press is full; the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision; for the day of the LORD [is] near in the valley of decision!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall gather in their light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The LORD shall also roar out of Zion and utter His voice from Jerusalem. And the heavens and the earth shall shake. But the LORD [will be] the hope of His people and the strength of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So you shall know that I [am] the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be a holy thing, and no aliens shall pass through her any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall be, in that day the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow [with] milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow [with] waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Egypt shall be a ruin, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, from violence [done] to the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they poured out in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Judah will dwell forever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will cleanse their blood [which] I did not cleanse; and the LORD is dwelling in Zion.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
