And the land was subdued before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And there remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, How long will you fail to go in to possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers has given you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Give from among you three men for [each] tribe. And I will send them, and they shall rise and go through the land and map it according to the inheritance of them. And they shall come to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall stay within their border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay within their borders on the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall map the land [into] seven parts and bring it here to me, so that I may cast lots here for you before the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the Levites have no part among you. For the priesthood of the LORD [is] their inheritance. And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the men arose and went away. And Joshua charged those who went to map the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and map it, and come again to me so that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the men went and passed through the land, and mapped it by cities into seven parts in a book, and they came to Joshua, to the host at Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD. And Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel there, according to their divisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up by their families. And the border of their lot came forth between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their border on the north side was from Jordan. And the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward. And their boundary was at the wilderness of Beth-aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which [is] Bethel, southward. And the border went down to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that lies on the south side of the lower Beth-horon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the border was drawn [from there], and went around the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that [is] in front of Beth-horon southward. And its boundary was at Kirjath-baal; it [is] Kirjath-jearim, a city of the sons of Judah. This [was] the west quarter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the south quarter [was] from the end of Kirjath-jearim; and the border went out westward, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the border went down to the end of the mountain that [is] before the valley of the sons of Hinnom, which [is] the Valley of the Giants northward, and went down the valley of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite on the south, and went down to En-rogel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was drawn from the north and went out to En-shemesh, and went out toward Geliloth, which [is] across from the ascent of Adummim, and went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward. And the boundary was at the north tongue of the Salt Sea, at the south end of Jordan. This [was] the south border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This [was] the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to its borders all around, according to their families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Chephar-haam-monai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities and their villages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which [is] Jerusalem; Gibeath, Kirjath; fourteen cities and their villages.
