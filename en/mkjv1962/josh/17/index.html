And these [were] the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers. And according to the command of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there fell ten portions [to] Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which [were] on the other side Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah before Shechem. And the border went up to the right to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh [belonged] to the sons of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the border went down to the river Kanah, southward of the river. These cities of Ephraim [are] among the cities of Manasseh. And the border of Manasseh [was] on the north of the river, and the boundary was at the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Southward [it was] Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's. And the sea is its border. And they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and those who lived in Dor and its towns, and those who lived in Endor and its towns, and those who lived in Taanach and its towns, and those who lived in Megiddo and its towns, even three regions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet the sons of Manasseh were not able to occupy these cities, but the Canaanites wanted to live in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened when the sons of Israel had become strong, they put the Canaanites to tribute. But they did not completely drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua saying, Why have you given me one lot and one portion to inherit, since I [am] a great people, because the LORD has blessed me until now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua answered them, If you [are] a great people, and if mount Ephraim is too narrow for you, get up to the forest and cut down more for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sons of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us. And all the Canaanites who live in the land of the valley [have] chariots of iron, those who [are] of Beth-shean and its towns, and those who [are] of the valley of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You [are] a great people and have great power. You shall not have one lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the mountain shall be yours, for it [is] a forest, and you shall cut it down. And the outer limits of it shall be yours. For you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and though they [are] strong.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
