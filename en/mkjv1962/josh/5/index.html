Neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make sharp knives for yourselves and circumcise the sons of Israel again, the second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joshua made sharp knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And this [is] the reason why Joshua circumcised. All the people that came out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the wayside, after they came out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the people who came out were circumcised. But all the people born in the wilderness by the wayside, as they came forth out of Egypt, had not been circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the people, the men of war, who came out of Egypt, were destroyed, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD. To them the LORD swore that He would not show them the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that He would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joshua circumcised their sons, [whom] He raised up in their place. For they were not circumcised, because they had not been circumcised by the wayside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened when they had finished circumcising all the people, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said to Joshua, Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. Therefore, the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of Israel camped in Gilgal and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they ate of the old grain of the land on the next day after the Passover, unleavened cakes and roasted grain in the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna stopped on the next day after they had eaten the old grain of the land. And there was no more manna to the sons of Israel, but they ate the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened, when Joshua was beside Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked. And, behold, there stood a Man in front of him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, [Are] You for us, or for our foes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He said, No, but I have come [as] the Commander of the army of the LORD. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth. And he worshiped and said to Him, What does my Lord say to His servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, Take your shoe off your foot, for the place on which you stand [is] holy. And Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
