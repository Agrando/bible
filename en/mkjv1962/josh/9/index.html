For they came and acted as if they were ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their asses, and old and torn and bound up wineskins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and old and patched sandals on their feet, and old clothes on them. And all the bread they had taken was dry [and] moldy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country. Now therefore, make a treaty with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Perhaps you are living among us, and how shall we make a treaty with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said to Joshua, We [are] your servants. And Joshua said to them, Who [are] you, and from where do you come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to him, Your servants have come from a very far country, because of the name of the LORD your God. For we have heard of His fame and all that He did in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who [were] beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And our elders and all those who live in our country spoke to us saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them. Say to them, We [are] your servants. And now make a treaty with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We took this bread hot [for] our provision out of our houses on the day we came out to go to you. But now, see, [it is] dry, and it is moldy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these wineskins which we filled [were] new. And, see, they are torn. And these clothes and shoes of ours have become old because of the very long journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they received the men because of their provisions, and did not ask at the mouth of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua made peace with them, and made a treaty with them, to let them live. And the rulers of the congregation swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it happened at the end of three days after they had made a treaty with them, they heard that they [were] their neighbors and that they lived among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities [were] Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But all the rulers said to the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. Now, therefore, we may not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This we will do to them. We will even let them live, lest wrath be on us because of the oath which we swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rulers said to them, Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the rulers had promised them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you fooled us saying, We [are] very far from you, when you dwell among us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now you [are] cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being slaves and woodcutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was certainly told your servants how the LORD your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all those who lived in the land from before you; therefore, we were very much afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, behold, we [are] in your hand. As it seems good and right to you to do to us, do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, so that they did not kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua made them that day woodcutters and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which He should choose.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
