But to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no part to the Levites in the land, except cities to live [in], with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As the LORD commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did, and they divided the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the sons of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea regarding you and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I [was] forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land. And I brought him word again as it was in my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But my brothers that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I fully followed the LORD my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which your feet have trodden shall be your inheritance, and your sons' forever because you have fully followed the LORD my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive these forty-five years as He said, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel wandered in the wilderness. And now, lo, I am eighty-five years old today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As yet I [am as] strong today as [I was] in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength [was] then, even so [is] my strength now, for war, both to go out and to come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now give me this mountain of which the LORD spoke on that day. For you heard in that day [how] the giants [were] there, and that the cities were great and fortified. If the LORD will be with me, then I will be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, to this day, because he fully followed the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjath-arba; that one [was] a great man among the giants. And the land had rest from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
