For the LORD your God [is] He who has fought for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that are left to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the Great Sea westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD your God shall put them out from before you, and drive them out of your sight. And you shall possess their land, as the LORD your God has promised to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you do not turn aside from it [to] the right or to the left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so that you do not come among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But cleave to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the LORD has driven out from before you great and strong nations. But [as for] you, no one has been able to stand before you to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>One man of you shall chase a thousand. For the LORD your God [is] He who fights for you, as He has promised you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And take good heed to yourselves that you love the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Otherwise, if you go back in any way, and hold to those left of these nations, these that remain among you, and shall marry them and go in to them and they to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out these nations from before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and whips in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And behold, today I [am] going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your heart and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you. All have come to pass to you. Not one thing of it has failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it shall be, as comes to you every good thing which the LORD your God has spoken to you has come to you, so shall the LORD bring on you every evil thing until He has destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>when you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them, then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which He has given to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
