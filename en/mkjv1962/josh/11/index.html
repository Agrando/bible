You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joshua came suddenly, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom. And they fell on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them to great Sidon, and to the salt pits, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. And they struck them until they left them none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua did to them as the LORD commanded him. He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua at that time turned back and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword. For Hazor formerly [was] the head of all those kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they struck every soul in it with the edge of the sword, destroying [them]. And he left none breathing. And he burned Hazor with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joshua took all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them. And he struck them with the edge of the sword. He destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Israel did not burn any of them, the cities that stood in their strength, except Hazor only. Joshua did burn it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the sons of Israel took for a prize to themselves. But they struck every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They left none breathing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the LORD commanded Moses His servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountains of Israel, and its lowlands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>from mount Halak that goes up to Seir, even to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. And he took all their kings, and struck them and killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was not a city that made peace with the sons of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. All [others] they took in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts so that they should come against Israel in battle, so that they might be destroyed, so that they might have no favor, but that He might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At that time Joshua came and cut off the giants from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel. Joshua destroyed them with their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There were none of the giants left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod there remained some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD commanded Moses. And Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
