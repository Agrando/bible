Neither shall the sons of wickedness afflict them any more, as before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And even from the time that I commanded judges [to be] over My people of Israel, so will I cause you to rest from all your enemies. Also the LORD tells you that He will make you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when your days [are] fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall come out of your bowels. And I will make his kingdom sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But My mercy shall not leave him, as I took [it] from Saul, whom I put away before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne [shall be] established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD. And he said, Who [am] I, O Lord Jehovah? And what [is] my house, that You have brought me here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this was yet a small thing in Your sight, O Lord God. But You have spoken also of Your servant's house for a great while to come. And [is] this the manner of men, O Lord God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what can David say more to You? For You, O Lord Jehovah, know Your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Your word's sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things to make Your servant know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore You are great, O Jehovah God. For there is none like You, neither is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And what one nation in the earth [is] like Your people, like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to Himself, and to make Him a name, and to do for You great things and terrible, for Your land, before Your people, whom You redeemed to You from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For You have confirmed to Yourself Your people Israel [to be] a people to You forever. And You, LORD, have become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O LORD God, the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant, and concerning his house: establish [it] forever, and do as You have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let Your name be magnified forever, saying, The Jehovah of hosts [is] the God over Israel. And let the house of Your servant David be established before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For You, O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to Your servant, saying, I will build you a house. Therefore Your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Lord Jehovah, You [are] that God, and Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore, now, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, to be forever before You. For You, O Lord GOD, have spoken. And with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
