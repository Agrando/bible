And it happened when he came to David, he fell to the earth and bowed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David said to him, How did the matter go? Please tell me. And he answered, The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said to the young man who told him, How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan [are] dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man who told him said, As I happened to be upon Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear. And, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here [am] I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to me, Who [are] you? And I answered him, I [am] an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to me again, Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, because all my life [is] still in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown on his head, and [the] bracelet on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David took hold on his garments, and tore them. And likewise all the men with him [did] so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for his son Jonathan, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to the young man who told him, From where [are] you? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said, Why were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David called one of the young men and said, Go near; fall on him. And he struck him so that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said to him, Your blood [be] upon your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David chanted this death dirge over Saul and over his son Jonathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to teach the sons of Judah [The Song of] the Bow. Behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The beauty of Israel is slain upon your high places! How are the mighty fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tell [it] not in Gath, do not let it be known in the streets of Askelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Mountains of Gilboa, [let] not dew or rain [be] on you, nor fields of offerings. For there the shield of the mighty has been evilly cast away, the shield of Saul not [being] anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles; they were stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and with delights; who put ornaments of gold on your clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How [are] the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I [am] distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. Very pleasant you have been to me. Your love to me was wonderful, more than the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How [are] the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
