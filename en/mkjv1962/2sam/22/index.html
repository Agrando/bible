[He is] my Shield, and the Horn of my salvation, my High Tower, and my Refuge, my Savior. You save me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will call upon the LORD, [who is] worthy to be praised. And I shall be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the waves of death encircled me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The sorrows of hell hemmed me in. The snares of death went in front of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my distress I called upon the LORD and cried to my God. And he heard my voice out of His temple, and my cry [entered] into His ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of the heavens moved and shook because He was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down. And darkness [was] under His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He rode upon a cherub and did fly. And [He] was seen upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He made darkness coverings around Him, dark waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From the brightness before Him were coals of fire kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD thundered from the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and troubled them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were uncovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent from above, He took me. He drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me; for they were stronger than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went before me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He brought me forth also into a large place. He delivered me because He delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands He has rewarded me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all His judgments [were] before me. And as for His statutes, I did not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I was also upright before Him, and have kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in His eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the faithful You will show Yourself faithful; with the upright man You will show Yourself upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With the pure You will show Yourself pure; and with the perverted You will appear perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And You will save the afflicted people, but Your eyes [are] on the proud, [whom] You bring low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For You [are] my lamp, O LORD. And the LORD will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For by You I have run [through] a troop. By my God I have leaped over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[As for] God, His way [is] perfect. The word of the LORD [is] tried. He is a shield to all those who seek refuge in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who [is] God, except Jehovah? And who [is] a rock except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God [is] my strength [and] power, and He makes my way perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[He] makes my feet like hinds' [feet], and causing me to stand on my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He teaches my hands to war, so that my hands may bend a bow of bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, and Your gentleness has made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You have enlarged my steps under me, so that my feet did not slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them, and turned not again until I had finished them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I have crushed them and wounded them so that they could not rise. [Yea], they have fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For You have girded me [with] strength to battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You have also given me the necks of my enemies; I silenced those who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, but [there was] none to save; to the LORD, but He did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I stamped them like the mire of the streets [and] spread them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You have also delivered me from the strivings of my people, You have kept me the head of the nations. A people I knew not shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Strangers shall submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear, they shall obey me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their strongholds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The LORD lives! And blessed [be] my Rock, and exalted be the God, the Rock of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>It [is] God who avenges me and who brings down the peoples under me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and who brings me forth from my enemies. You also lift me up on high above those rising up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore, I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises to Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>[He is] the Tower of salvation for His king, and He shows mercy to His anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
