And David sent to comfort him for his father, by the hand of his servants. And David's servants came to the land of the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the leaders of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Do you think that David honors your father, that he has sent comforters to you? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Hanun took David's servants and shaved off half their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, to their buttocks, and sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they told David, and he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards are grown, and return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sons of Ammon saw that they had begun to stink before David. And the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and from King Maacah a thousand men, and from Ishtob twelve thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David heard. And he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Ammon came out and put the battle in order at the entering in of the gate. And the Syrians of Zobah, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, [were] by themselves in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind. And he chose from all the choice ones of Israel, and put [them] in order against the Syrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, so that he might set in order against the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me. But if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the LORD do that which seems good to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joab and the people with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians. And they fled before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, then they fled also before Abishai, and entered into the city. And Joab returned from the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Syrians saw that they were beaten before Israel, and they gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Hadarezer sent and brought out the Syrians who [were] beyond the river. And they came to Helam. And Shobach the commander of the army of Hadarezer went before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David was told. And he gathered all Israel and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in order to meet David and fought with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Syrians fled before Israel. And David killed [the men of] seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, who died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the kings, the servants of Hadarezer, saw that they were beaten before Israel, and [they] made peace with Israel and served them. And the Syrians feared to help the sons of Ammon any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
