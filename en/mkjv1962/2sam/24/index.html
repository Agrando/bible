But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the commanders of the army. And Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they passed over Jordan and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that [is] in the middle of the Valley of Gad, and to Jazer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi. And they came to Dan-jaan, and around to Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites and [of] the Canaanites; and went out to the south of Judah, to Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went to and fro through all the land, and came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand strong men who drew the sword. And the men of Judah [were] five hundred thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David's heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in what I have done. And now, I beseech You, O LORD, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David rose up in the morning. And the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go and say to David, So says the LORD, I offer you three [things]. Choose one of them, so that I may do [it] to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come upon you and on your land? Or will you flee three months before your enemies while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' plague in your land? And advise, and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said to Gad, I [am] in great distress. Let us fall now into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies [are] great. And do not let me fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from the morning even till the time appointed. And there died from the people, from Dan to Beer-sheba, seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD turned from the evil, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, Enough! And stay your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing-place of Araunah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? I pray You, let Your hand be against me and against my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up! Rear an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David went up, according to the saying of Gad, as the LORD commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out and bowed before the king, his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor from you, to build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what [seems] good to him. Behold, oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments, and instruments of the oxen for wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these Araunah, like a king, gave to the king. And Araunah said to the king, May the LORD your God accept you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said to Araunah, No, but I will surely buy from you at a price. And I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God [of that which costs me] nothing. And David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
