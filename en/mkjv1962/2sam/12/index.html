And he came to him and said to him, There were two men in one city, one rich and one poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>[The] rich one had exceeding many flocks and herds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but the poor one had nothing except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up. And it grew up together with him and with his sons. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there came a traveler to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the traveler that had come to him. But he took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man who had come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man. And he said to Nathan, [As] the Lord lives, the man who has done this shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Nathan said to David, You [are] the man! So says the LORD God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if that [was] too little, I would have given to you such and such [things] besides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do evil in His sight? You have stricken Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife [to be] your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So says the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house, and I will take your wives before your eyes and give [them] to your neighbor. And he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For you did [it] secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Only, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, this child born to you shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Nathan left to go to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David prayed to God for the child. And David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the elders of his house rose up toward him, to raise him up from the earth. But he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it happened on the seventh day, the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, Behold, while the child was still alive we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our voice. How then will he trouble himself if we tell him that the child is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But David saw that his servants whispered. And David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, Is the boy dead? And they said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David arose from the earth and washed, and anointed [himself], and changed his clothing, and came into the house of the LORD and worshiped. And he came to his house, and commanded, and they brought bread before him and he ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then his servants said to him, What [is] this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the living boy, but when the child was dead you arose and ate bread!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, Who can tell [if] God will be gracious to me so that the child may live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David comforted his wife Bathsheba. And he went in to her and lay with her. And she bore a son. And he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Jedidiah, because of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and took the royal city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joab sent messengers to David and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And therefore gather the rest of the people together, and camp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called after my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he took the king's crown from off his head, the weight of which [was] a talent of gold, and a precious stone in it. And it was [set] on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he brought forth the people that [were] in it, and put them to the saw, and to sharp tools of iron, and to axes of iron. And he made them go over into the brick-kiln. And so he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
