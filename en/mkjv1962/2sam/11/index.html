And they destroyed the sons of Ammon and circled Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it happened one evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king's house. And from the roof [he saw] a woman bathing. And the woman [was] very beautiful to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David sent and asked about the woman. And [one] said, [Is] not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David sent messengers and took her. And she came in to him, and he lay with her. And she had purified herself from her uncleanness. And she returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I [am] with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Uriah had come to him, David asked how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house and wash your feet. And Uriah left the king's house. And a gift from the king went out after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they told David, saying, Uriah did not go to his house. And David said to Uriah, Did you not come from a journey? Why have you not gone down to your house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Uriah said to David, The ark and Israel and Judah abide in tents. And my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are camped in the open fields. Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? [As] you live, and [as] your soul lives, I will not do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you go. And Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him. And he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it happened in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent [it] by the hand of Uriah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and draw back from him so that he may be stricken and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it happened when Joab observed the city, he sent Uriah to a place where he knew brave men [were].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab. And [some] of the people of the servants of David fell. And Uriah the Hittite also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And [he] commanded the messenger saying, When you have made an end of telling the matters of the war to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and if it be so that the king's wrath arise, and he say to you, Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerub-besheth? Did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall? And you shall say, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the messenger departed, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to [tell].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the messenger said to David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out to us to the field, and we were upon them even to the entering of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the shooters shot from off the wall upon your servants, and [some] of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then David said to the messenger, So you shall say to Joab, Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city and overthrow it. And you encourage him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband [was] dead, and mourned for her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when her mourning was past, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the eyes of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
