And his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Saul's son had two men [that were] captains of bands. The name of the one [was] Baanah, and the name of the other was Rechab, the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, of the sons of Benjamin. For Beeroth also was counted to Benjamin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the men of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and were strangers there until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who [was] lame in [his] feet. He was five years old when the news of Saul and Jonathan came out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled. And as she made haste to flee he fell and became lame. And his name [was] Mephibosheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, Rechab and Baanah, came at the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth. And he was lying [on his] bed [at] noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they came to the midst of the house, bringing wheat. And they struck him in the belly. And Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they came into the house, and he lay in his bed in his bedroom. And they struck him and killed him, and beheaded him and took his head and got away through the plain all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And [they] brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron. and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life. And the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, and said to them, [As] the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, [thinking] to have brought good news, I took hold of him and killed him in Ziklag. I gave that to him as a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Indeed when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged [them] up over the pool in Hebron.
