David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and His word [was] in my tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: he who rules over men justly, ruling [in] the fear of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>is as the light of the morning, as the sun rises, a morning without clouds. The tender grass [springs] out of the earth through shining after rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Although my house [is] not so with God, yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. For all my salvation, and all my desire, will He not make it grow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the wicked, all of them, [shall be] like a thorn thrust away, because they cannot be taken by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the man who shall touch them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. And they shall be utterly burned in [their] place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These [are] the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief of the three; he [was called] Adino the Eznite, because of the eight hundred [he] killed at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle; and the men of Israel had gone up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[he] arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and until his hand clung to the sword. And the LORD worked a great victory that day. And the people returned after him only to spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And next [was] Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a piece of ground full of lentils. And the people fled from the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he stood in the middle of the ground and delivered it, and killed the Philistines. And the LORD worked a great victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Adullam. And the troop of the Philistines pitched in the Valley of the Giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David [was] then in a stronghold, and the fort of the Philistines [was] then in Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David longed and said, Oh that someone would give me a drink from the water of the well of Bethlehem by the gate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David. But he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this. [Is it not] the blood of the men who went [in danger of] their lives? And he would not drink it. These three mighty men did these [things].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, [was] chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred [and] killed [them], and had the name among three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Surely he was honored more than the three. And he was their commander. However he did not attain to the [first] three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada from Kabzeel, a son of a mighty man, great [in] deeds. He killed two lion-like men of Moab. He went down also and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he killed an Egyptian, a man of form. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the [first] three. And David set him over his guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Asahel the brother of Joab [was] of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Shammah the Harodite; Elika the Harodite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Helez the Paltite; Ira the son of Ikkesh, the Tekoite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Abiezer the Anathothite; Mebunnai the Hushathite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Zalmon the Ahohite; Maharai the Netophathite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite; Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah, of the sons of Benjamin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Benaiah the Pirathonite; Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Abialbon the Arbathite; Azmaveth the Barhumite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen; Jonathan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shammah the Hararite; Ahiam the son of Sharer, the Hararite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite; Eliam the son of Ahithophel, the Gilonite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Hezrai the Carmelite; Paarai the Arbite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah; Bani the Gadite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Zelek the Ammonite; Naharai the Beerothite, armor-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ira, and Ithrite; Gareb, and Ithrite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Uriah the Hittite-- thirty-seven in all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
