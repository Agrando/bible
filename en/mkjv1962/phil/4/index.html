Again I say, Rejoice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord [is] at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, my brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things [are] honest, whatever [things are] right, whatever [things are] pure, whatever [things are] lovely, whatever  things are] of good report; if  there is] any virtue and if [there is] any praise, think on these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do those things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me. And the God of peace shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I rejoiced in [the] Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again. Although you indeed did think, but you lacked opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I speak according to need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet you did well in sharing my troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now you Philippians know also that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as regards giving and receiving, except you alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I do not say this because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I have all, and abound. I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things [which you sent], an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now unto God and our Father [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the saints greet you, most of all those who are of Caesar's household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
