To write the same things to you is indeed not grievous to me, but for you [it is] safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision party.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For we are the circumcision who worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks that he has reason to trust in the flesh, I more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I was circumcised [the] eighth day, of [the] stock of Israel, [of the] tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews. As regards the Law, [I was] a Pharisee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>concerning zeal, persecuting the church; regarding the righteousness in the Law, blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But whatever things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But no, rather, I also count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them [to be] dung, so that I may win Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and be found in Him; not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but through [the] faith of Christ, the righteousness of God by faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable to His death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I am pressing on, if I may lay hold of that for which I also was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My brothers, I do not count myself to have taken possession, but one [thing I do], forgetting the things behind and reaching forward to the things before,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let us therefore, as many as [are] perfect, be of this mind. And if in anything you are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yet, as to what we have already attained, let us walk in the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Brothers, be imitators together of me, and mark those who walk this way, for you have us [for] a pattern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(For many are walking, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, [as] the enemies of the cross of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, [those] who mind earthly things.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For our citizenship is in Heaven, from which also we are looking for the Savior, [the] Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who shall change our body of humiliation so that it may be fashioned like His glorious body, according to the working of His power, even to subdue all things to Himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
