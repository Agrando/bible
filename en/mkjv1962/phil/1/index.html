Nevertheless, in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached. And I rejoice in this. Yet, also I will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and [the] supply of [the] Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but as always now Christ shall be magnified in my body with all boldness, whether it is by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if [I] live in [the] flesh, this [is] the fruit of [my] labor. Yet I do not know what I shall choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I am pressed together by the two: having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to remain in the flesh [is] more needful for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having this confidence, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your advancement and joy of faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your conduct be as becomes the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you, or else am absent, I may hear of your [affairs], that you stand fast in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and terrified in nothing by your adversaries. [For this is] to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to you it is given on behalf of Christ not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
