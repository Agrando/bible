And one shall strike him in his presence, enough for his wrong, by a certain number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He may give him forty stripes, no more, lest he should exceed and beat him above these [with] many stripes, then your brother would be dishonored before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You shall not muzzle an ox when he treads out [the grain].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If brothers live together, and one of them dies and has no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry outside to a stranger. Her husband's brother shall go in to her and take her as a wife for himself, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it shall be, the first-born whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his dead brother, so that his name may not be put out of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if the man does not want to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate to the elders and say, My husband's brother refuses to raise up a name in Israel to his brother. He will not perform my levirate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him. And [if] he stands and says, I do not desire to take her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence of his elders, and take off his shoe from his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done to that man who will not build up his brother's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who has his shoe taken off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When men strive together with one another, and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand and takes him by the secret parts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then you shall cut off her hand.
