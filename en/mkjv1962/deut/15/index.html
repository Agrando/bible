Every man who has a loan to his neighbor shall release it. He shall not exact [it] from his neighbor, or from his brother, because it is called the LORD's release.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You may exact [it] from a foreigner, but your hand shall release that which is yours with your brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>except when there shall be no poor among you. For the LORD shall greatly bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you [for] an inheritance to possess it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>only if you carefully listen to the voice of the LORD your God to be careful to do all these commandments which I command you today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the LORD your God blesses you as He promised you. And you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow. And you shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If there is among you a poor man of one of your brothers inside any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you shall open your hand wide to him, and shall surely lend him enough for his need, that which he lacks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Beware that there is not a thought in your wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand, and your eye may be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing. And he may cry to the LORD against you, and it is sin to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall surely give to him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God shall bless you in all your works, and in all that you put your hand to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the poor shall never cease out of the land. Therefore, I command you saying, You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor, and to your needy, in your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If your brother, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when you send him out free from you, you shall not let him go away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall richly bestow on him from your flock, and from your grain floor, and from your winepress; with what the LORD your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you. Therefore I command you this thing today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if he says to you, I will not go away from you, because he loves you and your house, because it [has been] good for him with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then you shall take an awl and put [it] through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. And also to your slave-girl you shall do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It shall not seem hard to you when you send him away from you free, for he has been worth a double hired servant in serving you six years. And the LORD your God shall bless you in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the first-born males that come from your herd and from your flock, you shall set apart to the LORD your God. You shall do no work with the first-born of your bull, nor shear the first-born of your sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall eat before the LORD your God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, you and your household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if there is a blemish in it, lame, or blindness, or any ill blemish, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall eat it inside your gates. The unclean and the clean shall [eat it] alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only you shall not eat the blood of it. You shall pour it on the ground like water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
