For I the LORD your God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth [generation] of those who hate Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and doing mercy to thousands of those who love Me and keep My commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not acquit [the one] who takes His name in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Six days you shall labor and do all your work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the seventh day [shall be] the sabbath of the LORD your God. [In it] you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your ox, nor your ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger inside your gates, so that your manservant and your maidservant may rest like yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and with a stretched-out arm. Therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that your days may be made longer, and that it may go well with you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall not kill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall not steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you shall not lust after your neighbor's wife, nor shall you covet your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any [thing] that is your neighbor's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The LORD spoke these words to all your assembly in the mountain out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice. And He added no more. And He wrote them in two tablets of stone and delivered them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it happened when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, for the mountain burned with fire, you came near me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and you said, Behold! The LORD our God has revealed His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen today that God talks with man yet he [still] lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For who of all flesh has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we [have], and lived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You go near and hear all that the LORD our God shall say. And you speak to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to you, and we will hear and act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me. And the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They have well [said] all that they have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear Me and keep all My commandments always, so that it might be well with them and with their sons forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Go say to them, Go into your tents again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But as for you, you stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may do [them] in the land which I am giving them, to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you so that you may live and that good [may be] to you, and you may make [your] days longer in the land which you shall possess.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
