For that [is] hateful before the LORD. And you shall not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any duty. He shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife whom he has taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone to pledge, for he takes [a man's] life to pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man is found stealing a person of his brothers, the sons of Israel, and makes a slave of him, or sells him, then that thief shall die. And you shall put evil away from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be careful in the plague of leprosy, that you watch carefully and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you. As I commanded them, you shall be careful to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam by the wayside, after you had come forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you loan a loan of any kind to your brother, you shall not go into his house to bring forth his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you loan shall bring the pledge outside to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if the man [is] poor, you shall not sleep with his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall certainly give back to him the pledge at sundown, that he may sleep in his own clothing, and bless you. And it shall be righteousness to you before the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall not oppress a hired servant who [is] poor and needy, of your brothers, or of your strangers that [are] in your land within your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At his day you shall give [him] his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it.
