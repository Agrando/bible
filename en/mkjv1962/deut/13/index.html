For the LORD your God [is] testing you to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You shall walk after the LORD your God and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and you shall serve Him and hold fast to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has spoken to turn [you] away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slaves, to thrust you out of the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall put the evil away from the midst of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who [is] like your own soul, lures you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods which you have not known, you nor your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>that is, of the gods of the people who [are] around you, near you or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>you shall not consent to him nor listen to him. Nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare, nor shall you hide him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you shall surely kill him. Your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall stone him with stones so that he dies, because he has sought to drive you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If, in one of your cities which the LORD your God has given you to dwell in, you shall hear [one] saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Men, the sons of Belial, have gone out from among you and have drawn away those who live in their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then you shall inquire and make search, and ask carefully. And behold, [if it is true], and the thing is certain, [that] such an abomination is done among you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>you shall surely strike those who live in that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it completely, and all that [is] in it, and all the cattle of it, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall gather all its spoil into the middle of its street, and shall burn the city with fire, and all its spoil, every bit of it, for the LORD your God.
