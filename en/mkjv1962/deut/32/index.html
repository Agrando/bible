For all His ways [are] just, a God of faithfulness, and without evil; just and upright is He.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They have corrupted themselves: [they are] not His sons; [it is] their blemish; [they are] a crooked and perverse generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do you thus give back to the LORD, Oh foolish and unwise people? [Is] He not your Father who bought you? [Has] He [not] made you and established you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the LORD's portion [is] His people. Jacob [is] the lot of His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He found him in a desert land, and in the deserted, howling wilderness. He led him about, He cared for him, He kept him as the pupil of His eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them and bears them on her wing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the LORD alone led him, and [there was] no strange god with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He made him ride on the high places of the earth, so that he might eat the increase of the fields. And He made him suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>butter from cows, and milk from sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the sons of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat. And you drank the blood of the grape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked. You grew fat, thick, [and] satisfied. Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They provoked Him to jealousy with strange [gods]; with abominations they provoked Him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new ones newly come up, whom your fathers did not fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You forgot the Rock [who] brought you forth, and ceased to care for God who formed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD saw, and despised [them] because of the provoking of His sons and of His daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He said, I will hide My face from them; I will see what their end [shall be]. For they [are] a very perverse generation, sons in whom [is] no faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have moved Me to jealousy with a no-god. They have provoked Me to anger with their vanities. And I will move them to jealousy with a no-people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a fire is kindled in My anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with its increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will heap evils on them. I will spend My arrows on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Exhaustion by famine, and consumption by burning heat, and bitter destruction, and the teeth of beasts I will send on them, with the poison of crawling things of the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sword outside, and the terror inside, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling [also] with the man of grey hairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I said I would dash them to pieces; I would make the memory of them to cease from among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>were it not the provocation of an enemy I feared, lest their enemies should misconstrue; lest they should say, Our hand [is] high and the LORD has not done all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For they [are] a nation without wisdom, neither is there any understanding in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If they were wise, they would understand this; they would consider their latter end!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How shall one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them and the LORD had shut them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For their rock [is] not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For their vine [is] of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall. Their clusters [are] bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their wine [is] the poison of serpents, and the cruel venom of asps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[Is] not this laid up in store with Me and sealed up among My treasures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Vengeance and retribution [belong] to Me. Their foot shall slide in time, for the day of their calamity [is] at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the LORD will bring His people justice; and He shall have compassion on His servants, for He sees that [their] power is gone, and only the imprisoned and abandoned [remain].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He shall say, Where [are] their gods, [their] rock in whom they trusted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Who ate the fat of their sacrifices [and] drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you; let it be your hiding place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See now that I, I am He, and there is no god with me. I kill, and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is no deliverer out of My hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For I lift up My hand to Heaven and say, I live forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>If I sharpen My glittering sword, and if My hand takes hold in judgment, I will give vengeance to My enemies and will reward those that hate Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will make My arrows drunk with blood, and My sword shall devour flesh, with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the hairy scalp of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Rejoice, O, nations, [with] His people; for He will avenge the blood of His servants, and will render vengeance to His foes and will be merciful to His land, to His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you today, which you shall command your sons to observe and to do, all the words of this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For it [is] not a vain thing for you, because it is your life. And by this word you shall prolong [your] days in the land where you go over Jordan, there to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses that same day, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Go up into Mount Abarim, [to] Mount Nebo in the land of Moab, which is opposite Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And die in the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>because you sinned against Me among the sons of Israel at the Waters of Strife in Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not sanctify Me in the midst of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Yet you shall see the land before [you], but you shall not go there to the land which I [am] giving to the sons of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
