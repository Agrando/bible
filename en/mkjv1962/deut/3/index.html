And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle [at] Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the LORD said to me, Do not fear him, for I will deliver him and all his people, and his land, into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So the LORD our God delivered Og into our hands also, the king of Bashan, and all his people. And we struck him until none [was] left remaining to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And we took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All these cities [were] fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides a good many unwalled towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And we completely destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, completely destroying the men, women, and children of every city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But we took the cattle and the spoil of the cities as a prize for ourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon to Mount Hermon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(the Hermon [which] the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, and Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan [were taken].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the rest of the giants. Behold! His bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron. Is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? Nine cubits [was] its length, and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this is the land [which] we possessed at that time, from Aroer by the river Arnon, and half of Mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the men of Reuben and of Gad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites. And he called them after his own name, Bashan (Towns of Jair) to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I gave Gilead to Machir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon, half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the plain also, and Jordan, and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, under The Slopes of Pisgah eastward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I commanded you at that time saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it. You shall pass over armed before your brothers the sons of Israel, all the sons of might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But your wives and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that you have much cattle), shall stay in your cities which I have given you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>until the LORD has given rest to your brothers, as well as to you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God [has] given them beyond Jordan. And then you shall each one return to his possessions which I have given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I commanded Joshua at that time saying, Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So the LORD shall do to all the kingdoms where you pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall not fear them. For the LORD your God shall fight for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I begged the LORD at that time saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O, LORD God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness, and Your mighty hand. For what God [is there] in heaven or in earth who can do according to Your works, and according to Your might?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I pray you, let me go over and see the good land beyond Jordan, this good hill-country and Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not hear me. And the LORD said to me, [Let it be] enough for you. Speak no more to Me of this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Go up into the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and behold [it] with your eyes. For you shall not go over this Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him. For he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So we stayed in the valley over against Beth-peor.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
