And the LORD gave them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I turned myself and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made. And there they are, as the LORD commanded me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sons of Israel pulled up [stakes] from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan to Mosera. There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And Eleazar his son served in the priest's office in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>From there they pulled up to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of water brooks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to Him, and to bless in His name, until today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brothers. The LORD [is] his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I stayed in the mountain, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights. And the LORD listened to me at that time also. The LORD would not destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to me, Arise, Go before the people, causing them to go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>to keep the commandments of the LORD, and His statutes, which I command you today for your good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens [belong] to the LORD your God, the earth also, with all in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, you above all people, as [it is] today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stiff-necked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the LORD your God [is] God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, the mighty, and a terrible God, who does not respect persons nor take a bribe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He executes justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger in giving him food and clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve Him, and you shall hold fast to Him, and swear by His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He [is] your praise, and He [is] your God, who has done for you these great and terrible things which your eyes have seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons.
