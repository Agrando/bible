And He will have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations where the LORD your God has scattered you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If you are driven out into the outermost [parts] of the heavens, the LORD your God will gather you from there, and He will bring you from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it. And He will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those that hate you, who persecuted you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all His commandments which I command you today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD your God will make you have plenty in every work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your land, for good. For the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, as He rejoiced over your fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for you shall listen to the voice of the LORD your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law, [and] if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this commandment which I command you today [is] not hidden from you, neither is it far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It [is] not in Heaven, [that you should] say, Who shall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and do it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nor [is] it beyond the sea, [that you should] say, Who shall go over the sea for us to the region beyond the sea, and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and do it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the word [is] very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold!

And the LORD your God shall bless you in the land where you go to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if you turn away your heart, so that you will not hear, but shall be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I declare to you today that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong [your] days on the land where you pass over Jordan to go to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I call Heaven and earth to record today against you. I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore, choose life, so that both you and your seed may live,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that you may love the LORD your God, [and] that you may obey His voice, and that you may cling to Him. For He is your life and the length of your days, so that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give it to them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
