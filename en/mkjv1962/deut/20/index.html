For the LORD your God [is] with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it shall be, when you come near to the battle, the priest shall go up and speak to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and shall say to them, Hear, O, Israel, today you go up to battle against your enemies. Do not let your hearts faint, do not fear, and do not tremble, neither be terrified before their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the LORD your God [is] He who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the officers shall speak to the people saying, Who [is] the man that has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And who [is] the man that has planted a vineyard and has not used its fruits? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man use its fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And who [is] the man that has become engaged to a wife and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man take her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, Who [is] the man that is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brothers' heart faint as well as his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you come near a city to fight against it, then shout peace to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall be, if it makes the answer of peace and opens to you, then all the people found in it shall be forced laborers to you, and they shall serve you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the LORD your God has delivered it into your hands, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, all the spoil of it, you shall take to yourself. And you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So you shall do to all the cities [which are] very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But of the cities of these people, which the LORD your God gives you [for] an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; as the LORD your God has commanded you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so that they may not teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done to their gods. So you would sin against the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When you shall besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by forcing an axe against them. For you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down. For [is] the tree of the field a man that it should go before you to lay siege?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Only the trees which you know that they [are] not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down. And you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it is subdued.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
