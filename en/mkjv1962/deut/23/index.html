Even to his tenth generation he shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD. Even to their tenth generation they shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because they did not meet you with bread and with water in the way when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor, of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam, but the LORD your God turned the curse to a blessing to you, because the LORD your God loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You shall not despise an Edomite, for he [is] your brother.

And it shall be, when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the LORD your God walks in the middle of your camp, to deliver you and to give up your enemies before you. Therefore your camp shall be holy, so that He may see no unclean thing in you and turn away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall not deliver to his master the servant who has escaped from his master to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall live with you, among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of your gates, where it seems good to him.
