At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people. So you shall put the evil away from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If a matter [is] too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, matters of strife within your gates, then you shall arise and go up to the place which the LORD your God shall choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And [you] shall come to the priests of the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and ask. And they shall declare to you the sentence of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall do according to the sentence which they declare to you from that place which the LORD shall choose. And you shall be careful to do according to all that they tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach you and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand or the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man that acts proudly and will not listen to the priest who stands to minister there before the LORD your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die. And you shall put away the evil from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all the people shall hear and fear, and not be presumptuous any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When you come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it and shall live in it and shall say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations around me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>you shall surely set a king over you, whom the LORD your God shall choose. You shall set a king over you from among your brothers.

Nor shall he greatly multiply silver and gold to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write a copy of this law in a book from before the priests the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law, and these statutes, to do them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he does not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or the left, so that he may make his days longer in his kingdom, he and his sons, in the midst of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
