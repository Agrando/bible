And you shall cut down the carved images of their gods, and destroy their names out of that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You shall not do so to the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you shall seek to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, even to His dwelling place you shall seek, and there you shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will offerings, and the first-born of your herds and of your flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households in which the LORD your God has blessed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You shall not do according to all that we do here today, each doing whatever [is] right in his own eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the LORD your God gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But [when] you go over Jordan and live in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies all around, so that you live in safety,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause His name to dwell there.
