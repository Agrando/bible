You shall hear the small as well as the great. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment [is] God's. And the cause that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when we pulled up from Horeb, we went [through] all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us. And we came to Kadesh-barnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I said to you, You have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God has given unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you. Go up. Possess [it], even as the LORD God of your fathers has said to you. Do not fear, neither be troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you came near to me, every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the saying pleased me very much. And I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they turned and went up into the mountain and came to the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought [it] down to us, and brought us word again and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God gives us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you murmured in your tents and said, Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Where [shall] we go up? Our brothers have broken our heart, saying, We have seen there a people greater and taller than we [are]. The cities are great and walled up to the heavens, also the sons of the giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then I said to you, Do not dread them nor be afraid of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The LORD your God who goes before you shall fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and in the wilderness where you have seen how the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came into this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in a cloud by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angry and swore, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him I will give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his sons, because he has fully followed the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Make him strong, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And your little ones, who you said would be a prey, and your sons who in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in there. And I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But you turn and pull up into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And you answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD; we will go up and fight according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when each one of you had buckled on his weapons of war, you were ready to go up into the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But the LORD said to me, Say to them, Do not go up, nor fight, for I [am] not among you, you will be beaten by your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So I spoke to you. And you would not hear, but rebelled against the command of the LORD, and went presumptuously into the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Amorites who lived in that mountain came out against you and chased you, even as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, to Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And you returned and wept before the LORD. But the LORD would not listen to your voice, nor give ear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
