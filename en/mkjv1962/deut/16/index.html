For in the month of Abib, the LORD your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And you shall therefore sacrifice the Passover to the LORD your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place His name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You shall eat no leavened [bread] with it. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it, the bread of affliction, for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste, so that you may remember the day that you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there shall be no leavened [bread] seen with you in all your borders for seven days. Nor shall [any] of the flesh which you sacrificed in the first day at evening remain all night until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates, which the LORD your God gives you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but at the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place His name in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going of the sun, at the time that you came out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you shall roast and eat in the place which the LORD your God shall choose. And in the morning you shall turn and go to your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Six days you shall eat unleavened [bread]. And on the seventh day [shall be] a solemn assembly to the LORD your God. You shall do no work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You shall count seven weeks to yourselves. Begin to count the seven weeks from the time you began [to put] the sickle to the grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall keep the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a measure of a free-will offering of your hand, which you shall give according as the LORD your God has blessed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your slave-girl, and the Levite inside your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, those among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place His name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt. And you shall be careful to do these statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall keep the Feast of Tabernacles seven days after you have gathered in your grain floor and your wine press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male slave, and your slave-girl, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow inside your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days you shall keep a solemn feast to the LORD your God in the place which the LORD shall choose. Because the LORD your God shall bless you in all your increase, and in all the works of your hands, therefore you shall surely rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which He shall choose: in the Feast of Unleavened [Bread], and in the Feast of Weeks, and in the Feast of Tabernacles. And they shall not appear before the LORD empty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[but] each with his gift in his hand, according to the blessing of the LORD your God, which He has given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall appoint judges and officers for yourself in all your gates which the LORD your God gives you, tribe by tribe. And they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not pervert judgment; you shall not respect persons, nor take a gift. For a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live and inherit the land which the LORD your God gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You shall not set up for yourself pillars of any trees near the altar of the LORD your God which you shall make for yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nor shall you set up an image, which the LORD your God hates.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
