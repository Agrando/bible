For she shall eat them secretly for lack of all [things], in the siege and anguish with which your enemies shall distress you in your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH YOUR GOD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>then Jehovah will make your plagues remarkable, and the plagues of your seed great and persistent plagues; with evil and long-lasting sicknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Also, He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt of which you were afraid. And they shall cling to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also, every sickness and every plague which [is] not written in the book of this law, the LORD will bring them on you until you are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And you shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of the heavens for multitude, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall be, as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you, so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you and to bring you to nothing. And you shall be plucked from off the land where you go to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the [one] end of the earth even to the [other], and you shall serve other gods there, which neither you nor your fathers have known, wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among these nations you shall find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest. But the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And your life shall hang in doubt before you, and you shall fear day and night, and shall have no assurance of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning you shall say, Oh that it were evening! And at evening you shall say, Oh that it were morning, for the fear of your heart with which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again. And there you shall be sold to your enemies for men-slaves and women-slaves, and no man shall buy [you].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
