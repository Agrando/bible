And behold, [if] the witness [is] a false witness [and] has testified falsely against his brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>then you shall do to him as he had thought to have done to his brother. So you shall put the evil away from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those who remain shall hear and fear, and shall commit from then on no such evil among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And your eye shall not pity.
