And He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths; for the law shall go forth out of Zion, and the Word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He shall judge between many peoples, and will decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, And they shall not still learn war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they shall sit each one under his vine and under his fig tree; and there shall be no trembling; for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all peoples will walk, [each] one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day, says the LORD, I will gather the lame, and I will gather the banished, and the one I have afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will make the lame into a remnant, and her who was cast off a strong nation; and the LORD shall reign over them in Mount Zion from now on, even forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it shall happen. And rulers, the chief ones, shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king among you? Has your counselor perished? For pangs have taken you like one giving birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be in pain and deliver, daughter of Zion, like one giving birth. For now you shall go out from the city, and you shall dwell in the field; and you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be snatched back; there the LORD shall redeem you from the hand of your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now also many nations are gathered against you, who say, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes look on Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But they do not know the plans of the LORD, nor do they understand His counsel. For He has gathered them like the sheaf to the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; and you shall crush many peoples. And I will give their gain to the LORD, and their wealth to the Lord of the all the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
