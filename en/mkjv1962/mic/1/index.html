And let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from His holy temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For behold, the LORD [is] coming out of His place, and will come down and walk on the high places of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the mountains shall melt under Him, and the valleys shall tear themselves, as wax before the fire, and as waters poured down a steep place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All this [is] for the transgression of Jacob, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What [is] the transgression of Jacob? [Is it] not Samaria? And what [are] the high places of Judah? [Are they] not Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will make Samaria into ruins of the field, planting places for a vineyard; and I will pour down her stones into the valley, and I will uncover her foundations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her gifts shall be burned with the fire, and I will destroy all its idols. For she gathered it from the reward of a harlot, and they shall return to the reward of a harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore I will wail and howl; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like jackals, mourn like the daughters of an ostrich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For her wounds [are] not curable; for it has come to Judah; it has reached to the gate of My people, to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not declare [it] in Gath; weep not at all; in the house of Leaphrah roll [in] the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pass over to them, O dweller of Shaphir, in nakedness of shame. The dweller of Zaanan has not gone out; the mourning of Beth-ezel shall take from you his standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For be grieved for good, the dweller of Maroth, for evil came down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the stallion; she [is] the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, for the sins of Israel were found in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore you shall give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib [are] for a lying thing to the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet I will bring an heir to you, O dweller of Mareshah.
