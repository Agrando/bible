And they break their bones and chop them in pieces, like that in the pot, like those in the middle of the kettle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then they shall cry to the LORD, but He will not answer them. He will even hide His face from them at that time, as they have done evil in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So says the LORD concerning the prophets who make My people err, who bite with their teeth and cry, Peace! And whoever does not give for their mouth, they even sanctify a war against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore a night shall be to you [without] vision; and darkness [without] divining.
