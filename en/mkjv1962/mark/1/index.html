And he ate locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he proclaimed, saying, There is One coming after me who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down to loosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I indeed have baptized you in water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there came a voice from Heaven, [saying], You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. And He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God draws near. Repent, and believe the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And walking along beside the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus said to them, Come after Me and I will make you fishers of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when He going farther from there a little, He saw James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately He called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they went into Capernaum. And immediately on the sabbath day He entered into the synagogue and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were astonished at His doctrine. For He taught them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, What [is] to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit, convulsing him, and crying with a loud voice, he came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They all were amazed, so as to question among themselves, saying, What is this? What new doctrine [is] this? For He even commands the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And immediately His fame went out into all the Galilean neighborhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately after they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and at once they told Him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. And instantly the fever left her, and she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And at evening, when the sun set, they brought all those who were diseased to Him, and those who had been demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the city had gathered at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He healed many who were sick of different diseases, and cast out many demons. And He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And rising up quite early in [the] night, He went out and went away into a deserted place, and [He] was praying there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon, and those with him, searched for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And finding Him, they said to Him, All are seeking You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He said to them, Let us go into the next towns so that I may proclaim there also. For that reason I came forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He proclaimed in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And a leper came to Him, begging Him and kneeling down to Him, and saying to Him, If You will, You can make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out [His] hand and touched him, and said to him, I will; be clean!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And He having spoken, the leprosy instantly departed from him and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He strictly charged him and immediately sent him away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and He said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone. But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer those things which Moses commanded for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But going out, he began to proclaim [it] very much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
