And many other such things you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to them, Do you do well to set aside the commandment of God, so that you may keep your own tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother. And, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban! (that is, A gift [to God], whatever you may profit by me)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and you no longer allow him to do anything toward [his] father or mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have delivered. And you do many such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And calling near all the crowd, He said to them, Listen to Me, every one of you, and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing from outside a man which entering into him can defile [him]. But the things which come out of him, those are the ones that defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when He had entered into the house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said to them, Are you also without understanding? Do you not perceive that whatever enters into the man from outside cannot defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the waste-bowl, purifying all food?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He said, That which comes out of the man is what defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evil things pass out from inside and defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He arose from there and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered into a house and desired no one to know [it]. But He could not be hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of Him and came and fell at His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by race. And she begged Him that He would cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be filled. For it is not right to take the children's loaves and to throw [it] to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He said to her, For this saying go, the demon has gone out of your daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter lay on the couch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the borders of the Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they brought a deaf one to Him, hardly speaking. And they begged Him to put [His] hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He took him aside from the crowd and put His fingers into his ears. And He spat and touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking up to Heaven, He sighed and said to him, Ephphatha! (that is, Be opened!)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And instantly his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He commanded them, that they should tell no one. But the more He commanded them, so much the more they proclaimed [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
