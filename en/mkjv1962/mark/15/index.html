And they bound Jesus and led [Him] away and delivered [Him] to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Pilate asked Him, Are you the king of the Jews? And answering He said to him, You say [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused Him [of] many things, but He answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate asked Him again, saying, Do you answer nothing? Behold how many things they witness against you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And at [that] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with the insurgents, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the crowd, crying aloud, began to beg [him to do] as he had always done to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him because of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate answered and said again to them, What then do you desire that I should do [to him] whom you call the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cried out again, Crucify him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Pilate said to them, Why? What evil has he done? And they much more cried out, Crucify him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And deciding to do the easiest [to] the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them, and having scourged [Him], delivered up Jesus to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led Him away inside the court, which is [the] praetorium. And they called together all the cohort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothed Him with purple and plaited a crown of thorns and put it around His [head].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they struck Him on the head with a reed, and spat on Him, and placing the knees, [they] bowed to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him and put His own clothes on Him and led Him out to crucify Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they made one who was passing by, Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they brought Him to Golgotha Place (which translated is, Place of a Skull).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they gave Him wine mixed with myrrh to drink. But He did not take [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots on them, as, to what [each] should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was [the] third hour, and they crucified Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the inscription of His accusation was written over [Him], THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with Him they crucified two thieves, the one off [the] right, and one off [the] left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the Scripture was fulfilled which said, And he was numbered with [the] lawless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You [razing] the temple and building [it] in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save yourself and come down from the cross!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes, said to one another, He saved others but he cannot save himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let Christ the King of Israel now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe. And they who were crucified with Him insulted Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And [it] being [the] sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? (which being translated is, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And hearing, some of those standing by said, Behold, he calls Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put [it] on a reed and gave [it] to him to drink. [But they said], Let alone, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And letting out a loud voice, Jesus expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when the centurion, who stood across from him, saw that He cried out so, [and] expired, he said, Truly this man was Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And also women were watching from a distance, among whom also was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>(who also, when He was in Galilee, followed Him and ministered to Him), and many [other] women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it, becoming evening already, since it was [the] Preparation, that is, [the] day before sabbath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pilate wondered if He were already dead. And calling the centurion, he asked him whether He had died already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he knew [it] from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he bought a linen cloth, and took Him down, and wrapped [Him] in the linen, and laid Him in a tomb which was cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses saw where He was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
