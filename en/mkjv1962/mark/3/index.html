And a man was there who had a withered hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they watched Him to see if He would heal him on the sabbath day, so that they might accuse Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise! Come into the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And He said to them, [Is it] lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? To save life, or to kill? But they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And looking around on them with anger, being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he stretched [it] out. And his hand was restored whole, like the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples. And a great crowd from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and [from] beyond Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon, a great throng came to him, having heard how much He was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He spoke to His disciples, so that a small boat should stay near to Him, because of the crowd, lest they should press on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For He had healed many, so that they pressed on Him in order to touch Him, as many as had plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, [they] fell down before Him and cried, saying, You are the Son of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He strictly charged them that they should not make Him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He went up into a mountain and called near those whom He would. And they came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He ordained twelve, that they should be with Him, and that He might send them out to proclaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He put on Simon [the] name Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He put on James [the son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, [the] names Boanerges, which is, the Sons of Thunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And [He appointed] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James [the son] of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And they went into a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again a crowd came together, so that they could not even eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And hearing, those with Him went out to take hold [of] Him; for they said, He is insane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He called them and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan rises up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No one can enter into a strong one's house and plunder his goods, except he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never shall have forgiveness, but is liable to eternal condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then His brothers and His mother came. And standing outside, [they] sent to Him, calling Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the crowd sat about Him, and they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking for You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He answered them, saying, Who is My mother, or My brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He looked around on those who sat about Him, and said, Behold My mother and My brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever does the will of God, the same is My brother and My sister and My mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
