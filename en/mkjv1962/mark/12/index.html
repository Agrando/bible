A man planted a vineyard, and set a fence about [it], and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and [he] let it out to vinedressers, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, so that he might receive from the vinedressers the fruit of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And taking [him], they beat him and sent [him] away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And again he sent to them another servant. And stoning that one, they struck [him] in the head, and sent [him] away, insulting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And again he sent another. And they killed him, and many others, beating some and killing some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, still having one son, his own beloved, he also sent him to them last of all, saying, They will respect my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But those vinedressers said among themselves, This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they took him and killed [him] and cast [him] out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore what will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And have you not read this scripture  The] Stone which the builders rejected has become the Head of [the] corner:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they sought to seize him, but feared the crowd. For they knew that He spoke the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they sent certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him, to catch Him in [His] words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And coming, they said to Him, Teacher, we know that you are true and you care about no one. For you do not look to [the] face of men, but teach the way of God [in] truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, Why do you tempt Me? Bring me a denarius so that I may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they brought [it]. And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this? And they said to Him, Caesar's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And answering Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Sadducees came to Him, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked Him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die and leaves [his] wife, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the second took her, and died; neither did he leave any seed. And the third likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the seven had her, and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And answering Jesus said to them, Do you not err because of this, not knowing Scriptures, nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when they shall rise from [the] dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are as the angels in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as regards the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses how God spoke to him in the Bush, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not the God of [the] dead, but the God of [the] living. Therefore you greatly err.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And coming up one of the scribes heard them reasoning, knowing that He had answered them well, he asked Him, Which is [the] first commandment of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel, [the] Lord our God is one Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and you shall love [the] Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. This [is] the first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And [the] second [is] like this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the scribe said to Him, Right, Teacher, according to truth You have spoken, that God is one, and there is no other besides Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love the neighbor as himself, is more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And seeing that he had answered intelligently, Jesus said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared to question Him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And answering, teaching in the temple, Jesus said, How do the scribes say that Christ is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David therefore himself calls Him Lord, and why [then] is He his son? And the great crowd heard Him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, who love to walk about in robes, and [love] greetings in the markets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who devour widows' houses, and as a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And sitting down opposite the treasury, Jesus watched how the people threw copper coins into the treasury. And many rich ones threw in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And a certain poor widow came, and she threw in two lepta, which is a kodrantes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He called His disciples and said to them, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast [in] more than all those who have cast into the treasury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For all cast in from their abundance. But she, out of her poverty, has cast [in] all that she had, all her livelihood.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
