And there was a great crowd gathered to Him, so that He entered into a boat and sat in the sea. And the whole crowd was on the land by the seaside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And He taught them many things by a parable. And He said to them in His teaching:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as he sowed, it happened that indeed some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and ate it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And another fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth. And it sprang up at once, due to not having deepness of earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when [the] sun rose, it was scorched. And because it had no root, it withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another fell on good ground and yielded fruit, going up and increasing. And one bore thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundredfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when He was alone, they who were about Him, with the Twelve, asked Him concerning the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those outside, all [these] things are [given] in parables</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He said to them, Do you not know this parable? And how then will you know all parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower sows the Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are those by the wayside, where the Word is sown. And when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these are those likewise being sown on stony places; who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward when affliction or persecution arises for the Word's sake, they are immediately offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these are those being sown among thorns; such as hear the Word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the cares of this world, and the deceit of riches, and the lust about other things entering in, choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And these are those sown on good ground, who hear the Word and welcome [it], and bear fruit, one thirty, one sixty, and one a hundredfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He said to them, Does a lamp come to be put under a grain-measure, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed; nor became covered, but that it might come to the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With that measure which you measure, it shall be measured to you. And to you who hear, more shall be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he who has, [more] shall be given to him; and he who has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth brings out fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit has been brought out, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And He said, to what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or by what parable shall we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when it has been sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches, so as to enable the birds of the air to roost under its shade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables He spoke the Word to them, as they were able to hear [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But he did not speak to them without a parable. And when [they were] alone, He explained all things to His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And evening having come, He said to them on that day, Let us pass over to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when they had sent away the crowd, they took Him with them as He was in the boat. And there were also other little boats with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there arose a windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He was in the stern of the boat, asleep on a headrest. And they awakened Him and said to Him, Master, do You not care that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He awakened and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And He said to them, Why are you so fearful? How [is it] that you have no faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly and said to one another, What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
