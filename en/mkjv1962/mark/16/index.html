And they were frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, Do not be frightened. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen, He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go tell His disciples and Peter that He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see Him, as He said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went out quickly and fled from the tomb. For they trembled and were amazed. Neither did they say anything to anyone, for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when [Jesus] had risen early the first [day] of the Sabbath, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went [and] told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And those hearing that He lives, and was seen by her, they did not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After that He appeared in another form to two of them, walking [and] going into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went and told [it] to the rest. Neither did they believe those.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward He appeared to the Eleven as they reclined. And [He] reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He said to them, Go into all the world, proclaim the gospel to all the creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And miraculous] signs will follow to those believing these things: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak new tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on [the] sick, and they will be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then indeed, after speaking to them, the Lord was taken up into Heaven, and sat on [the] right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And going out, they proclaimed everywhere, the Lord working with [them] and confirming the word by miraculous] signs following. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
