What stones and what buildings!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And answering Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There shall not be one stone left on another that shall not be thrown down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And [as] He sat on the Mount of Olives, across from the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell us, When shall all these things be? And what [shall be] the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus answering them began to say, Beware that no one deceive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For many shall come in My name, saying, I AM, and shall deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when you shall hear [of] wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. For it must happen, but the end [shall] not [be] yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be earthquakes in different places, and there shall be famines and troubles. These things [are] the beginnings of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But take heed to yourselves. For they shall deliver you up to sanhedrins, and in the synagogues you shall be beaten. And you shall be brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But whenever they lead [you] away and deliver [you] up, take no thought beforehand what you should speak or think. But speak whatever shall be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speaks, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And a brother will betray a brother to death, and a father his son. And children will rise up against [their] parents and will cause them to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you will be hated by all for My name's sake, but he enduring to the end, that [one] will be kept safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when you see the abomination of desolation, that spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let him who is in the field not turn back again in order to take up his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But woe to those with [babe] in womb, and to those who give suck in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And pray that your flight is not in the winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For [in] those days shall be affliction, such as has not been from [the] beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never [shall] be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect's sake, whom He has chosen, He has shortened the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And then if anyone shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ! Or, lo, there! Do not believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give miraculous] signs and wonders in order to seduce, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But take heed; behold, I have told you all things beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the stars of Heaven shall fall, and the powers in the heavens shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then He shall send His angels and shall gather His elect from the four winds, from [the] end of [the] earth to [the] end of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And learn the parable of the fig-tree: when her branch is still tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So you also, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, at [the] doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Truly I say to you that this generation shall not pass away until all these things occur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But of that day and hour no one knows, no, not the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As a man going away, leaving his house, and giving authority to his servants, and each man's work to him, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then you watch, for you do not know when the lord of the house is coming, [at] evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or early;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest he come suddenly [and] find you sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what I say to you, I say to all. Watch.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
