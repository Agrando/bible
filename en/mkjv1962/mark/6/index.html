And His disciples followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And when the sabbath day had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing [Him], were astonished, saying, Where does this one get these things? And what wisdom [is] this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are done by his hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his native-place, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He could do no work of power there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick ones, He healed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went around the villages, in [a] circuit, teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He called the Twelve and began to send them out by two and two. And He gave them authority over unclean spirits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and commanded them that they take nothing in [the] way, except only a staff; no bag, no bread, no copper in the belt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but tying on sandals, and not to put on two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, abide there until you depart from [that place].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went out and proclaimed that [men] should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cast out many demons, and anointed many who were sick with oil, and healed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And king Herod heard [of Him] (for His name had become well-known,) and he said that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead, and therefore mighty works operate in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said [that it was] Elijah. And others said that he is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But hearing Herod said, It is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent out and laid hold on John and had bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For he had married her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Herodias held it against him, and desired to kill him, but she could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For Herod feared John, knowing that [he was] a just and holy man. And he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he did many things and heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a convenient day came, when Herod made a supper to great men on his birthday, and to the chiliarchs, and to the first ones of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced and pleased Herod, and those who reclined with [him], the king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you desire from me, and I will give [it] to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he swore to her, Whatever you shall ask from me, I will give [it] to you, to the half of my kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately going in with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I desire that you give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And becoming deeply grieved, the king, because of his oath, and those reclining together, he did not wish to reject her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought his head in a platter and gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when his disciples heard, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the apostles gathered themselves to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He said to them, Come aside into a deserted place and rest a little. For there were many coming and going, and they had no opportunity even to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they departed by boat into a deserted place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the crowds saw them leaving, and many knew Him. And [they] ran together on foot there, out of the cities. And they went before them and came together to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And going out Jesus saw a large crowd. And He was moved with compassion toward them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And [it] now becoming a late hour, His disciples came to Him and said, This is a deserted place and [it is] now a late hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Send them away so that they may go to the surrounding fields and villages and buy loaves for themselves. For they have nothing to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said to them, You give them [food] to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii of loaves and give them to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He commanded them all to recline, group [by] group, on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they reclined group [by] group, by hundred and by fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to Heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and gave [them] to His disciples to set before them. And He divided the two fish to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they all ate and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up twelve hand baskets full [of] fragments, also from the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And those eating the loaves were about five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And immediately He constrained His disciples to get into the boat and to go before to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent away the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And taking leave [of] them, He went away to the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when evening had come, the boat was in [the] middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And He saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came toward them walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a phantom, and cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For they all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He talked with them, and said, Be of good cheer. I AM! Do not be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He went up into the boat to them. And the wind was cut off. And they were very much amazed within themselves beyond measure, and marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For they did not understand [the miracle] of the loaves, for their hearts were hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And crossing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they had come out of the boat, at once knowing Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>they ran all around that neighborhood, and began to carry on cots those who were sick, wherever they heard He was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wherever He entered, into villages or cities or country, they laid the sick in the streets and begged Him if only they might touch but the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
