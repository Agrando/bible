For many of them come from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And His disciples answered Him, From where can a man satisfy these [with] loaves here in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He commanded the people to recline on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, and He broke and gave to His disciples to set before them. And they set [them before] the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they had a few fish. And He blessed and commanded them to also serve these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they ate and were filled. And [they] took up over and above seven lunch baskets [of] fragments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And immediately He entered into a boat with His disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking a sign from Heaven from Him, tempting Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He sighed deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, [There shall no] sign be given to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He left them. And entering into the boat again, He departed to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And [the disciples] had forgotten to take loaves, and they did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He charged them, saying, Take heed! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [of] the leaven of Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And knowing [it], Jesus said to them, Why do you reason [that it is] because you have no loaves? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Have you still hardened your heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do you have eyes and do not see? Do you have ears and do not hear? And do you not remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many hand baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the seven among four thousand, how many lunch baskets full of fragments did you take up? And they said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He said to them, How do you not understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And He came to Bethsaida. And they brought a blind man to Him and begged Him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spat on his eyes and had put [His] hands on him, He asked Him if he saw anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he looked up and said, I see men as trees, walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And after that He put [His] hands again on his eyes and made him look up. And he was restored and saw all clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus and His disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And in the way He asked His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered, John the Baptist. But others [say] Elijah, and others say one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He said to them, But who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And He charged them that they should tell no one of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He spoke that saying openly. And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when He had turned around and looked on His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan! For you do not mind the things of God, but of the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel's, he shall save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Or what shall a man give in exchange [for] his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man shall also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
