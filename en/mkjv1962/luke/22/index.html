Where do You desire that we prepare?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said to them, Behold, when you have entered into the city, you will meet a man bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house where he enters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I shall eat the passover with My disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he shall show you a large, furnished upper room. Prepare there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went and found it as He had said to them. And they prepared the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the hour came, He and the twelve apostles with Him reclined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I say to you, I will not any more eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He took the cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide [it] among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He took bread and gave thanks, and He broke [it] and gave [it] to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In the same way He took] the cup, after having dined, saying, This cup [is] the new covenant in My blood, which is being poured out for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, behold, the hand of My betrayer [is] with Me on the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And truly the Son of man goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there was also a dispute among them as to which of them seems to be greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He said to them, The kings of the nations exercise lordship over them. And they who exercise authority on them are called benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you [shall] not [be] so: but the greater among you, let him be as the lesser, and he who governs, as [one] who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For which [is] the greater; he who reclines, or he who serves? [Is] it not he who reclines? But I am among you as He who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You are those who have continued with Me in My trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I appoint a kingdom to you, as My Father has appointed to Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired you, that he may sift [you] as wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not. And when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You, both into prison and into death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He said, I say to you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before you shall deny knowing Me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and wallet and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He said to them, But now, he who has a purse, let him take [it], and likewise [his] wallet. And he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say to you that this which is written must yet be accomplished in Me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors; for the things concerning Me have an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, behold, here [are] two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going out, according to [His] custom, He went to the Mount of Olives. And His disciples also followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when He was at the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw. And He kneeled down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And an angel appeared to Him from Heaven, strengthening Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly. And His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when He rose up from prayer and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping because of sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And [He] said to them, Why do you sleep? Rise and pray lest you enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And [as] He [was] yet speaking, behold a crowd! And he who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, went before them. And he drew near Jesus to kiss Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And those around Him seeing what was about to occur, [they] said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered and said, Let [it] go until now. And touching his ear, He healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to the chief priests and commanders of the temple, and the elders, who had come to Him, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and staves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was with you in the temple daily, you did not stretch out your hand on Me. But this is your hour, and the authority of the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And laying hold on Him, they led [Him] away and brought Him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And lighting a fire in [the] middle of the court, and they sitting down, Peter sat in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But a certain slave-girl saw him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked on him and said, This [man] was with him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while another saw him and said, You also are of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And about an hour afterward, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this one was also with him, for he is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter said, Man, I do not know what you say. And immediately, while he still spoke, the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned and looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter went out and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men who held Jesus mocked Him, beating [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And blindfolding Him, [they] struck Him on His face. And they asked Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is it who struck you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And they spoke many other things blasphemously against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And when day came, the body of elders of the people, and the chief priests and the scribes, came together. And they led Him to the sanhedrin, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Are you the Christ? Tell us. And He said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Also if I ask [you], you will not answer Me nor let Me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>From now on the Son of man shall sit at the right [hand] of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And they all said, Are you then the Son of God? And He said to them, You say [it], because I AM!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What need do we have for any witness? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
