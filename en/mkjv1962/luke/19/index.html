And he was rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he sought to see Jesus, to see who He was. And he could not because of the press, because he was little in stature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he ran in front and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him. For He was to pass through that [way].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him. And He said to him, Zaccheus! Hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And hurrying he came down, and received Him joyfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And seeing, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to stay with a sinful man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor. And [in] anything I accused anyone falsely, I restore [it] fourfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as they heard these things, He added and spoke a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was about to appear immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore He said, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom for himself, and to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He called his ten servants and delivered ten minas, and said to them, Trade until I come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But his citizens hated him. And they sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this one to reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had received his kingdom and had returned, then it happened that he commanded these servants to be called to him; the ones to whom he had given the silver; so that he might know what each had gained by trading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And came the first, saying, Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, Well [done], good servant, because you have been faithful in a least thing, have authority over ten cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the second came, saying, Lord, your mina has made five minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said the same to him, You be over five cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another came, saying, Lord, behold, [here is] your mina, which I have kept in a handkerchief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, wicked servant! You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I had not laid down and reaping what I did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And why did you not give my silver on the [bank] table, and coming I might have exacted it with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him and give [it] to him who has ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For I say to you that to everyone who has, more will be given. And from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But those who are my enemies, who did not desire that I should reign over them, bring them here and slay [them] before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And saying these things, He went in front, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it happened as He drew near Bethphage and Bethany, toward the mount called Mount of Olives, He sent two of the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, Go into the village across [from you], and having entered, you will find a colt tied up, on which no one of men has yet sat. Untie it and bring [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying [it]? You will say this to him, Because the Lord has need of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And going, those who were sent found as He had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And [as] they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought him to Jesus. And they threw their garments on the colt. And they set Jesus on [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as He went, they spread their clothes in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when He had come near, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all [the] mighty works which they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, Blessed [is] the King coming in the name of the Lord! Peace in Heaven and glory in [the] highest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And He answered and said to them, I tell you that if these should be silent, the stones would cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And as He drew near, He beheld the city and wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, If you had known, even you, even at least in this day of yours, the things for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days will come on you that your enemies will raise up a rampart to you, and will surround you, and will keep you in on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they will tear you down, and your children within you, and will not leave a stone on a stone because you did not know the time of your visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And entering into the temple, He began to cast out those selling and buying in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And He taught in the temple daily. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And [they] could not find what they might do, for all the people were hanging on Him, listening.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
