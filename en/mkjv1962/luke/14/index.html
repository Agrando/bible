And taking [him], He healed him and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit and will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they could not answer Him again as to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He put forth a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose out the chief places, saying to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When you are invited by anyone to a wedding, do not recline in the chief seat, lest a more honorable [man] than you may be invited by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he who invited you and him shall come and say to you, Give place to this man; and then you begin with shame to take the last place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then glory shall be to you before those reclining with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For whoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He also said to him who invited Him, When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends or your brothers, or your kinsmen, or [your] rich neighbors; lest they also invite you again, and a recompense be made to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when you make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and you shall be blessed, for they cannot repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of those who reclined with [Him] heard these things, and [he] said to Him, Blessed [are] those eating bread in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He said to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all with one [consent] began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, I must go and see it. I beg you, have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I beg you, have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And coming up that servant reported these things to his lord. And the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and the maimed, and the lame and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant said, Lord, [it] is done as you have commanded, and still there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges and compel [them] to come in, so that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I say to you that none of these men who were invited shall taste of my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And great crowds went with Him. And He turned and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and his [own] life also, he cannot be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me, he cannot be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first [and] count the cost, whether he may have [enough] to finish it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>lest perhaps, after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish, all those seeing begin to mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not first sit down [and] consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks [conditions] of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then, everyone of you who does not forsake all his possessions, he cannot be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Salt [is] good, but if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is not fit for the land, nor for manure, [but men] throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
