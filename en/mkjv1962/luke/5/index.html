But the fishermen had left them and were washing [their] nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, He asked him to thrust out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the people out of the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as He stopped speaking, He said to Simon, Launch out into the deep and let your nets down for a haul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And answering, Simon said to Him, Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing. Yet at Your word I will let down the net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And doing this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish. And their net was being torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they signaled the partners, those in the other boat, to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And seeing, Simon Peter fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the haul of fish which they had taken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and so also [were] James and John, [the] sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear, from now on you will be taking men alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And bringing their boats onto land, forsaking all things, they followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it happened, as He was in a certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy! And seeing Jesus, he fell on [his] face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You will, You can cleanse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And stretching out the hand, He touched him, saying, I will! Be clean! And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He commanded him, Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the word about Him spread even more. And great crowds were coming to hear, and to be healed from their infirmities by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But He was drawing back in the wilderness, and praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened on one of the days, even He was teaching. And Pharisees and teachers of [the] Law were sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And  the] power of [the] Lord was there, for the curing [of] them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And behold, men carrying, on a cot, a man who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in and to lay [him] before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not finding a way by [which] they might bring him in through the crowd, going up on the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst, before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And seeing their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, except God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But knowing their thoughts, answering, Jesus said to them, Why do you reason in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Rise up and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic, I say to you, Arise, and take up your cot [and] go to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately he rose up before them and took up [that] on which he lay. And he departed to his own house, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled [with] fear, saying, We saw wonderful things today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after these things He went out and saw a tax-collector named Levi, sitting at the tax-office. And [He] said to him, Follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And leaving all, he rose up and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made a great feast in his own house for Him. And there was a great company of tax-collectors and of others who were reclining with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax-collectors and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are sound do not need a physician, but those who are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they said to Him, Why do John's disciples fast often and make prayers, and also [the disciples] of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But He said to them, Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He also spoke a parable to them: No one puts a piece of a new garment on an old garment. Otherwise, both the new will tear, and [the old] does not match [the] piece from the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskin will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Also no one having drunk old [wine] immediately desires new, for he says, The old is better.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
