And they were grievously afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the angel said to them, Do not fear. For behold, I give to you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For to you is born today, in [the] city of David, a Savior, who is Christ [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this [is] a sign to you.

And this man [was] just and devout, waiting for [the] Consolation of Israel. And [the] Holy Spirit was on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it happened to him, being instructed by the Holy Spirit, he was not to see death before he would see [the] Christ of [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And [as] the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do according to the custom of the law concerning Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>even he received Him in his arms and blessed God, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lord, now You will let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my eyes have seen Your Salvation</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which You have prepared before [the] face of all the peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a light for revelation [to the] nations, and the glory of Your people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this One is set for [the] fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also), so that [the] thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of [the] tribe of Asher. She was advanced in many days, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she [was] a widow [of] eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And she coming in at that instant gave thanks to the Lord and spoke of Him to all those in Jerusalem eagerly expecting redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they had finished all things according to [the] Law of [the] Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when He was twelve years [old], they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fulfilling the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day's journey. And they looked for Him among the kinsfolk and acquaintances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when they did not find Him, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And it happened that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And seeing Him, they were amazed. And His mother said to Him, Child, why have you done so to us? Behold, your father and I have looked for you, greatly distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And He said to them, Why did you look for Me? Do you not know that I must be about My Father's [business] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they did not understand the word which He spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He went with them and came to Nazareth, and He was subject to them. But His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus increased [in] wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
