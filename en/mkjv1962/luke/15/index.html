And he divided [his] living to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And not many days afterward, the younger son gathered all together and went away into a far country. And there he wasted his property, living dissolutely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land. And he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he was longing to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, and no one gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father abound in loaves, and I perish with hunger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you, and am no more worthy to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, Bring the best robe and put [it] on him. And put a ring on his hand and shoes on [his] feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And bring the fattened calf here and kill [it]. And let us eat and be merry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this my son was dead and is alive again, he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And his elder son was in the field. And as he came and drew near the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him safe and sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and entreated him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And answering he said to [his] father, Lo, these many years I have served you, neither did I transgress your commandment at any time. And yet you never gave [me] a kid so that I might make merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed for him the fattened calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
