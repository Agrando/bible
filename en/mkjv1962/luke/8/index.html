And the Twelve [were] with Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and also certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to Him of their possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And a great crowd coming together, and those in each city coming to Him, He spoke by a parable:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, the one fell by the roadside and was trampled; and the birds of the air devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And other fell on a rock, and sprouting, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And other fell amidst thorns, and springing up with the thorns, [they] choked it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And other fell on good ground and sprang up, and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when He had said these things, He cried, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And His disciples asked Him, saying, What might this parable be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God. But to others I speak in parables, so that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those by the roadside are the ones who hear; then the Devil comes and takes the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Those on the rock [are] the ones who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy. And these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And those which fell among thorns are the ones who, when they have heard, go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life, and do not bear to maturity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But those on the good ground are the ones who, in an honest and good heart, having heard the Word, keep [it] and bring forth fruit with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And no one lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts [it] under a couch; but he sets [it] on a lampstand so that those who enter in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For nothing is secret that shall not be revealed; nor secret which shall not be known and come to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore be careful how you hear. For whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And His mother and [His] brothers came to Him. And they could not come near Him because of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it was told to Him [by some], who said, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside desiring to see You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are those who hear the Word of God and do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it happened on a certain day that He went into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put out to sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a storm of wind came onto the lake. And they were being filled [with water] and were in jeopardy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they came to Him and awakened Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! Then being aroused, He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He said to them, Where is your faith? And being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this One? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they sailed down to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He going out onto land, He met a certain man out of the city, who had had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, nor stayed in a house, but among the tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him and said with a loud voice, What is to me and to You, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I beseech You, Do not torment me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had seized him. And he had been kept bound in chains and in fetters, and he broke the bands and was driven into the deserted [places] by the demons.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain. And they begged Him that He would allow them to enter into them. And He allowed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And coming out of the man, the demons entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And those feeding [the pigs], and seeing the thing, fled. And leaving, [they] reported to the city and to the farms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they went out to see what had been done. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had departed sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Also those who saw [it] told them how the demon-possessed one was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And all the multitude of the neighborhood of the Gadarenes were seized with a great fear, and asked Him to depart from them. And entering into the boat, He returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the man out of whom the demons had gone out begged Him, [desiring] to be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Return to your own house and declare what God has done to you. And he went his way and proclaimed throughout all the city what [great] things Jesus had done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And it happened when Jesus had returned, the people received Him. For they were all waiting for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And behold, a man named Jairus came, and he was a synagogue-ruler. And he fell down at Jesus' feet and begged Him that He would come into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as He went, the people thronged Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And a woman who had a flow of blood twelve years (who had spent all her living on physicians, [and] could not be healed by any)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>came behind [Him] and touched the border of His garment. And instantly her flow of blood was staunched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus said, Who touched Me? And all having denied, Peter and those with Him said, Master, the crowd presses and jostles You, and You say, Who touched Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus said, Someone has touched Me, for I know that power has gone out of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And seeing that she was not hidden, the woman came trembling. And falling down before Him, she declared to Him before all the people why she had touched Him, and how she was instantly healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And He said to her, Daughter, be comforted. Your faith has saved you; go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He was still speaking when someone came from the synagogue-ruler, saying to him, Your daughter is dead, do not trouble the Teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But when Jesus heard, He answered Him, saying, Do not fear, only believe and she shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And coming into the house, He allowed no one to go in, except Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the girl.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all were weeping and bewailing her. But He said, Do not weep; she has not died, but sleeps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they ridiculed, knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And He put them all out. And He took her by the hand and called, saying, Little girl, arise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit came again, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that [food] be given her to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were astonished. But He charged them to tell no one the thing that happened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
