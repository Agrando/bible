And His disciples plucked the heads [of grain] and ate, rubbing [them] in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And answering, Jesus said to them, Have you not read this, what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>how he went into the house of God and took the showbread, and ate (and also gave to those who were with him) which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He said to them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it happened, also on another sabbath, that He entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the scribes and Pharisees watched him [to see] if He would heal on the sabbath day, so that they might find an accusation against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But He knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil, to save life, or to destroy [it] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And looking around on them all, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he did so. And his hand was restored whole like the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they were filled [with] madness, and talked with one another [as to] what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it happened in those days that He went out into a mountain to pray, and He was spending the night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, He called His disciples. And He chose twelve of them, whom He also named apostles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew and Thomas; James [the son] of Alpheus, and Simon who was called Zelotes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Judas [the brother] of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also became [the] betrayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And coming down with them, He stood on a level place. And a crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon (who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases) were there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>also those tormented by unclean spirits; and they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the crowd sought to touch Him, for power went out of Him and healed [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And lifting up His eyes to His disciples, He said, Blessed [are] the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed [are] you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed [are you] who weep now, for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed [are] you when men shall hate you, and when they shall cut you off, and when they shall reproach [you] and shall cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. For behold, your reward [is] great in Heaven. For so their fathers did according to these things to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you who are full! For you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! For you shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe to you when all men shall speak well [of] you! For so their fathers did to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And to him who strikes you on the [one] cheek, also offer the other. And to him who takes away your garment, do not forbid your tunic also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to everyone who asks of you, and from him who takes away your goods, do not ask [them] again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you desire that men should do to you, you do also to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if you love those who love you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend [to those] of whom you hope to receive, what thanks do you have? For sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing [in return]. And your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest. For He is kind to the unthankful and [to] the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it shall be given to you, good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over, they shall give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you measure, it shall be measured to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He spoke a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not above his master, but everyone who is perfect shall be like his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brother's eye, but do not see the beam that is in [your] own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the splinter in your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First cast out the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the splinter that is in your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit, neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For every tree is known by [its] own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth the good. And an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth the evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Whoever comes to Me and hears My words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock; and a flood occurring, the stream burst against that house and could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who hears and does not perform, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, on which the stream burst, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
