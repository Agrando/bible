Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying, The Son of man must be delivered into [the] hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they remembered His words</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the Eleven and to the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And their words seemed to them like foolishness, and they did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Peter arose and ran to the tomb, and stooping down he saw the linens lying alone. And he went away wondering to himself at what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, it being [about] sixty stadia from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they talked to each other of all these things which had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And while they talked and reasoned, it happened that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes were held [so that] they could not know Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He said to them, What words [are] these that you have with one another [as] you walk, and are so sad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to Him, [Are] you only a stranger in Jerusalem and have not known the things which have occurred there in these days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to [the] judgment of death, and have crucified Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we had trusted that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel. And besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yes, and also some of our women astounded us, having been early at the tomb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and when they did not find His body, [they] came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some of those with us went to the tomb and found [it] even as the women had said. But they did not see Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He said to them, O fools and slow of heart to believe all things that the prophets spoke!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew near the village where they were going. And He appeared to be going further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is far spent. And He went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it happened [as] He reclined with them, taking the loaf, He blessed [it], and breaking it, He gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him. And He became invisible to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said to one another, Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us by the way and while He opened the Scriptures to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found assembled the Eleven and those with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, the Lord has indeed risen, and has appeared to Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the way they related the things happening, and how He had been known by them in breaking of the loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they spoke this, Jesus Himself stood in their midst, and said to them, Peace to you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were terrified and filled with fear, for they thought they saw a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Behold My hands and My feet, that I am He! Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see Me have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when He had spoken this, He showed them [His] hands and feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And while they still did not believe for joy, and wondered, He said to them, Have you any food here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they handed to Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He took [it] and ate before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and [in] the Psalms about Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And He said to them, So it is written, and so it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from [the] dead the third day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that repentance and remission of sins should be proclaimed in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And you are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And behold, I send the promise of My father on you. But you sit in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And He led them out as far as Bethany. And lifting up His hands, He blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it happened as He blessed them, He withdrew from them and was carried up into Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
