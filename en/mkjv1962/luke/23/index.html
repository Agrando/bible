And He answered him and said, You say [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate said to the chief priests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And hearing Galilee, Pilate asked if the man is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And knowing that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And seeing Jesus, Herod greatly rejoiced, for he had desired to see Him [for] a long [time], because he had heard many things about Him. And he hoped to see some miracle done by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he questioned Him in many words, but He answered him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And humiliating Him with his guardsmen, and mocking [Him] by putting luxurious clothing around Him, Herod sent Him again to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And that same day Pilate and Herod became friends with one another, for before they were at enmity [between] themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pilate said to them, You have brought this Man to me as perverting the people. And behold, having examined [Him] before you, I have found no fault in this Man [regarding those things] of which you accuse Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>no, nor even Herod, for I sent you to him, and lo, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore I will chastise Him and release [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(For it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they all cried out at once, saying, Away with this One! And release to us Barabbas</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(who was thrown into prison because of a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pilate, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they cried, saying, Crucify! Crucify Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to them the third [time], Why? What evil has He done? I have found no cause of death in Him, therefore I will chastise Him and let [Him] go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they pressed [on him], with loud voices, requesting that He might be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate gave judgment that their request should be granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released to them [the one] who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder, for whom they had asked. But he delivered up Jesus to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country. And they laid the cross on him, that he might carry [it] after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a great multitude of people were following Him, and of women who also were bewailing and lamenting Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which did not suckle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! And to the hills, Cover us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And two others, two criminals, were led with Him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they came to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified Him and the criminals there, one on [the] right, and one on [the] left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do. And parting His clothing, they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood watching. And also the rulers with them, scoffing, saying, He saved others, let Him save Himself, if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And coming near, the soldiers also mocked Him, and offering Him sour wine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, If You are the king of the Jews, save Yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one of the hanged criminals blasphemed Him, saying, If you are Christ, save Yourself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But answering, the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since [you] are in the same condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly so, for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this Man has done nothing amiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until [the] ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. And when He had said this, He breathed out the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when the centurion saw what had been done, he glorified God, saying, Truly this Man was righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the crowd arriving together at this sight, beholding the things happening, struck their breasts and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all those known to Him stood at a distance; and [the] women, those accompanying Him from Galilee, [were] seeing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And behold, a man named Joseph, a councillor, a good man and a just one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>this one was not assenting to their counsel and deed. [He was] from Arimathea, a city of the Jews; and he also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This [man] went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he took it down and wrapped it in linen. And he laid it in a tomb that had been cut in the stone, in which no man had before been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And that day was the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And also women [were] following, who were accompanying Him out of Galilee, who watched the tomb, and how His body was placed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they returned and [they] prepared spices and ointment. And they rested [on] the sabbath day according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
