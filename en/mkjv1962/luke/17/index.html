But woe [to him] through whom they come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>It were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck and he were cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Take heed to yourselves. If your brother trespasses against you, rebuke him. And if he repents, forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if he trespasses against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turns again to you, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be rooted up and be planted in the sea! And it would obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But which of you who has a servant plowing or feeding will say [to him] immediately after he has come from the field, Come, recline?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will [he] not say to him, Prepare something [so that] I may eat, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink. And afterward you shall eat and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[Does] he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So likewise you, when you shall have done all the things commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants, for we have done what we ought to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as He went to Jerusalem, it happened that he went through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as He entered into a certain village, ten leprous men met Him, who stood afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they lifted voice and said, Jesus, Master, pity us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And seeing [them], He said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it happened, as they went, that they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and glorified God with a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he fell down on [his] face at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And answering, Jesus said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where [are] the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Were none found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He said to him, Rise and go; your faith has cured you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nor shall they say, Lo here! or, behold, there! For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And He said to the disciples, The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall say to you, Lo, here! or, behold, there! Do not go away, nor follow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightning which lights up, flashing from the [one part] under heaven, [and] shines to the [other part] under heaven, so also shall the Son of man be in His day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first He must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it was in the days of Noah, so it also shall be in the days of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until [the] day that Noah entered into the ark; and the flood came and destroyed [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So also as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but the day Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from the heaven and destroyed [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even so it shall be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day he who shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise, he who is in the field, let him not return to the things behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and whoever shall lose [his life] shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, in that night there shall be two in one bed, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two shall be grinding together, one will be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Two shall be in the field, one will be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Wherever the body [is], there the eagles will be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
