And what [shall be] the sign when these things are about to take place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He said, Take heed that you are not deceived, for many shall come in My name, saying, I AM! Also, The time has come! Do not go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for all these things must first occur, but the end [is] not at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great earthquakes shall be in different places, and famines and plagues. And there shall be terrors and great signs from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you and persecute [you], delivering [you] up to the synagogues and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall return to you for a testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore settle [it] in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what you shall answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall be betrayed also by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends. And they will cause [some] of you to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall be hated by all for My name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But there shall not a hair of your head perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By your patience you will gain your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when you see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that its destruction has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And let those in Judea flee to the mountains. And those in its midst, let them go out. And those in the open spaces, let them not go into her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But woe to those who are with child, and to those suckling in those days! For there shall be great distress in the land and wrath on this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall fall by [the] sword's edge. And shall be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the nations until [the] times of [the] nations is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars. And on the earth [will be] anxiety of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men fainting from fear, and expecting those things which have come on the earth. For the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when these things begin to happen, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He spoke a parable to them: Behold the fig-tree and all the trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now when they sprout leaves, seeing [it] you will know that summer is now near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass away until all [these] things are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts are weighed down with headaches and drinking and anxieties of this life; and that day should suddenly come on you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for it shall come as a snare on all those sitting on [the] face of the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Watch therefore, praying in every season that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things which shall occur, and to stand before the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And [in] the days He was teaching in the temple. And [in] the nights He went out, and lodged in the mount called [the Mount] of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And all the people came early in the morning to Him in the temple, in order to hear Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
