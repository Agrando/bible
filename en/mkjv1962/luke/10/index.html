Therefore pray [to] the Lord of the harvest that He may send forth laborers into His harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Go! Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Carry neither purse nor bag nor sandals. And greet no one by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest on it. If not, it shall return to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things [shared] by them; for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not move from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And heal the sick that are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, going out into the streets say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even the dust of your city which clings to us, we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented a long while ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you, Capernaum, which has been lifted up to Heaven, you shall be thrust down into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The one hearing you hears Me, and he who despises you despises Me; he who rejects you [also] rejects Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said to them, I saw Satan fall from Heaven like lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I give to you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the authority of the enemy. And nothing shall by any means hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet do not rejoice in this, that the [evil] spirits are subject to you, rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in Spirit and said, I thank You, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from [the] sophisticated and cunning, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it was pleasing before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things are delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son will reveal [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He turned to [His] disciples and said privately, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that you see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen [them], and to hear what you hear, and have not heard [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted Him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And answering, he said, You shall love [the] Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And He said to him, You have answered right; do this and you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And answering, Jesus said, A certain [man] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothing and wounded him, and departed, leaving [him] half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And by coincidence a certain priest came down that way and seeing him, he passed by on the opposite [side].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And in the same way a Levite, also being at the place, coming and seeing [him], he passed on the opposite [side].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain traveling Samaritan came upon him, and seeing him, he was filled with pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And coming near, [he] bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And going on the next day, he took out two denarii and gave [them] to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him. And whatever more you spend, when I come again I will repay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then which of these three, do you think, was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said, The [one] doing the [deed of] mercy to him. And Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And as they went, it happened that He entered into a certain village. And a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet [and] heard His word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she came to Him and said, Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But one thing is needful, and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
