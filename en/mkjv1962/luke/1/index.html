And his wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they were both righteous before God, walking blameless in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren. And both were advanced in their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened in his serving in the order of his course, before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>according to the custom of the priests, it was his lot to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And an angel [of the] Lord appeared to him as he was standing on [the] right of the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And seeing [this], Zacharias was troubled, and fear fell on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the angel said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias. For your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall neither drink wine nor strong drink. And he shall be filled with [the] Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall turn many of the sons of Israel to [the] Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he shall go before Him in [the] spirit and power of Elijah, to turn [the] hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to [the] wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am old, and my wife is advanced in her days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And answering, the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God. And I am sent to speak to you and to show you these glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people waited for Zacharias and marveled that he stayed so long in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he came out, he could not speak to them. And they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, and remained speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as soon as the days of his service were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the Lord has dealt with me in the days in which He looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of [the] house of David. And the virgin's name [was] Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the angel came in to her and said, Hail, [one] receiving grace, the Lord [is] with you. Blessed [are] you among women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when she saw [him], she was troubled at his saying, and considered what kind of greeting this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her, Do not fear, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And behold! You shall conceive in [your] womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name JESUS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He shall be great and shall be called the Son of [the] Highest. And the Lord God shall give Him the throne of His father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I do not know a man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come on you, and [the] power of [the] Highest shall overshadow you. Therefore also that Holy [One] which will be born of you shall be called Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And behold, your cousin Elizabeth also conceived a son in her old age. And this [is] the sixth month with her who [was] called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For with God nothing shall be impossible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Mary said, Behold the servant of [the] Lord. Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And [she] entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it happened as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed [are] you among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of your womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And from where [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For lo, as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed [is] she who believes, for there shall be a perfecting of those things which were told her from [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For He looked on the humiliation of His slave woman. For, behold, from now on all generations shall count me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For the Mighty One has done great things for me; and holy [is] His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And His mercy [is] on those who fear Him from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He has worked power with His arm, He has scattered the proud in [the] imagination of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He has put down rulers from [their] seats and exalted the lowly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He has filled [the] hungry with good things, and He has sent away [the] rich empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of [His] mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And the time was fulfilled to Elizabeth [for] her to bear. And she bore a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard how [the] Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were calling it Zacharias, after his father's name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said to her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they made signs to his father as to how he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosened]. And he spoke and praised God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came on all who lived all around them. And all these things were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all those who heard laid [them] up in their hearts, saying, What kind of child shall this be! And the hand of [the] Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father Zacharias was filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed [is the] Lord, the God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from eternity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>that we should be saved from our enemies and from [the] hand of all who hate us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>to perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>[the] oath which He swore to our father Abraham,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>that He would grant to us, [that we], being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And you, child, will be called the prophet of [the] Highest, for you shall go before [the] face of [the] Lord to prepare His ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>through [the] tender mercy of our God; by which [the] Dayspring from on high has visited us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>to give light to those who sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into [the] way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew and became strong in spirit and was in the deserts until [the] day of his showing to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
