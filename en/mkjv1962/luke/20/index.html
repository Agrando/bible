Or who is he who gave you this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing, and you answer me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The baptism of John, was it from Heaven or from men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if we say, From men, then all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they answered that they could not tell from where [it was].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to vinedressers. And [he] went into a far country for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, so that they should give him the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent [him] away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again he sent another servant. And they also beat him and treated [him] shamefully, and sent [him] away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again he sent a third. And they also wounded him and cast [him] out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that they will respect [him] when they see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir! Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed [him]. What then shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall come and destroy these vinedressers and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, Let it not be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He looked at them and said, What then is this which is written,  The] Stone which the builders rejected, the same has become [the] Head of [the] corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoever shall fall on that Stone shall be broken, but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him the same hour. And [they] feared the people, for they perceived that He had spoken this parable against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they watched and sent forth spies, pretending themselves to be righteous men, so that they might seize upon a word of His, that they might deliver Him in this way to the power and authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and do not accept the person of anyone, but truly teach the way of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He perceived their craftiness and said to them, Why do you tempt Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Show Me a coin. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesar's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He said to them, Therefore render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they could not take hold of His words before the people. And they marveled at His answer and were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And certain of the Sadducees came, those speaking against a resurrection, [that it was] not to be. And they asked Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If anyone's brother dies, having a wife, and if he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife and died without children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the second took her as a wife, and he died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the third took her. And likewise the seven left no children and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Last of all the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be? For the seven had her [as] a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And answering, Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but they who shall be counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from [the] dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nor can they die [any] more, for they are equal to the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But that the dead are raised, even Moses pointed out at the Bush, when he called [the] Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For He is not God of [the] dead, but of the living. For all live to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And answering, certain of the scribes said, Teacher, you have spoken well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And after that they did not dare ask Him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He said to them, How do they say that Christ is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Even David himself says in [the] Book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David then calls Him Lord; how then is He his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And as all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at the feasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour widows' houses, and make long prayers for a show; the same shall receive a more severe condemnation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
