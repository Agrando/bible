Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said to them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. And he who has food, let him do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And tax-collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, Continue to do no more than that commanded to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the soldiers also asked of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not forcibly extort anyone, nor accuse [any] falsely. And be content with your wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, lest perhaps he was the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>John answered all, saying, I indeed baptize you with water, but He who is mightier than I comes, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose. He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>whose fan [is] in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor and will gather the wheat into His storehouse. But He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And then indeed exhorting many things, he proclaimed the gospel to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herod the tetrarch (being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all [the] evils which Herod had done)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>added still this above all, that he even shut John up in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it happened in the baptizing of all the people, Jesus also being baptized, and praying, and the heaven was opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily shape, like a dove on Him. And a voice came from Heaven, which said, You are My Son, the Beloved; I am delighted in You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus Himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) son of Joseph, [son of] of Heli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[son of] of Matthat, [son of] of Levi, [son of] of Melchi, [son of] of Janna, [son of] of Joseph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>[son of] of Mattathias, [son of] of Amos, [son of] of Nahum, [son of] of Esli, [son of] of Naggai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[son of] of Maath, [son of] of Mattathias, [son of] of Semei, [son of] of Joseph, [son of] of Juda,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>[son of] of Joanna, [son of] of Rhesa, [son of] of Zerubbabel, [son of] of Shealtiel, [son of] of Neri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[son of] of Melchi, [son of] of Addi, [son of] of Cosam, [son of] of Elmodam, [son of] of Er,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[son of] of Joses, [son of] of Eliezer, [son of] of Jorum, [son of] of Matthat, [son of] of Levi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>[son of] of Simeon, [son of] of Juda, [son of] of Joseph, [son of] of Jonan, [son of] of Eliakim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[son of] of Melea, the son of Menan, [son of] of Mattatha, [son of] of Nathan, [son of] of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>[son of] of Jesse, [son of] of Obed, [son of] of Boaz, [son of] of Salma, [son of] of Nahshon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>[son of] of Amminadab, [son of] of Ram, [son of] of Hezron, [son of] of Pharez, [son of] of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[son of] of Jacob, [son of] of Isaac, [son of] of Abraham, [son of] of Terah, [son of] of Nahor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>[son of] of Serug, [son of] of Reu, [son of] of Peleg, [son of] of Eber, [son of] of Shelah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[son of] of Cainan, [son of] of Arphaxad, [son of] of Shem, [son of] of Noah, [son of] of Lamech,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>[son of] of Methuselah, [son of] of Enoch, [son of] of Jared, [son of] of Mahalaleel, [son of] of Cainan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>[son of] of Enos, [son of] of Seth, [son of] of Adam, [son of] of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
