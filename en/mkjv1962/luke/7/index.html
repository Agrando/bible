But He being yet not far off from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself. For I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come to You; but say a word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And hearing these things, Jesus marveled at him. And turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, I have not found such faith, no, not in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the sick servant well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened on the next day, He went into a city called Nain. And many of His disciples and a great crowd went with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And drawing near the gate of the city, even behold, one having died was being carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a considerable crowd of the city was with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He came and touched the bier. And the ones who bore [him] stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the one who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He delivered him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fear came on all. And they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this report of Him went out in all Judea, and in all the neighborhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his disciples reported all these things to John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And John, calling near a certain two of his disciples, sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Are You He that should come, or do we look for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And coming to Him, the men said, John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, Are You He who should come, or do we look for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in the same hour He cured many of infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits. And He gave sight to many who were blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And answering, Jesus said to them, Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is proclaimed to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And blessed is [he] who shall not be offended in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the people concerning John. What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed with soft clothing? Behold, those in splendid clothing and being in luxury are in kings' palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is [he] of whom it is written, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I say to you, Among [those] who are born of woman there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And all the people and the tax-collectors who heard [Him] justified God, being baptized [with] the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not being baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in a market and calling to one another, and saying, We have played the flute to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you did not weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But wisdom has been justified by all her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, He reclined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And behold, a woman, a sinner in the city, knowing that He reclined in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And she stood behind [Him], weeping at His feet, and she began to wash His feet with tears and wipe them with the hair of her head. And [she] ardently kissed His feet and anointed [them] with the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But seeing this, the Pharisee who had invited Him, spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what kind of woman [this is] who touches him, for she is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And answering, Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and [the] other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they having nothing to pay, he freely forgave both. Then which of them do [you] say will love him most?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And answering, Simon said, I suppose that one to whom he forgave most. And He said to him, You have judged rightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He turned to the woman and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, yet you gave Me no water for My feet. But she has washed My feet with tears, and has wiped [them] with the hair of her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You gave Me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And those reclining with [Him] began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
