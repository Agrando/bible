And she came to Him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he would not do so for a time. But afterward he said within himself, Though I do not fear God nor regard man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, that she not wear me down in [the] end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And shall not God avenge His own elect who cry day and night to Him, though He has been long-suffering over them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to you that He will avenge them speedily. Yet when the Son of man comes, shall He find faith on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He spoke this parable to certain ones who trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised others:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee stood and prayed within himself in this way: God, I thank You that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax-collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice [on] the Sabbath, I give tithes of all that I possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And standing afar off, the tax-collector would not even lift up [his] eyes to Heaven, but struck on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other. For everyone who exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they also brought infants to Him, that He might touch them. But when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called them and said, Allow the little children to come to Me, and forbid them not. For of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no way enter into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? None [is] good except One, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, I have kept all these from my youth up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, Yet you lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to [the] poor, and you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come, follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, He said, How hardly those having riches shall enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier [for] a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich one to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the ones who heard said, And who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter said, Lo, we have left all and have followed You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and, in the world to come everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He took the Twelve and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For He will be delivered to the nations and will be mocked and insulted and spat on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they will scourge [Him] and put Him to death, and the third day He will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they did not understand any of these things. And this saying was hidden from them, nor did they know the things which were spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And as He came near Jericho, it happened that a certain blind man sat by the roadside begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And hearing the crowd pass by, he asked what it meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David! Have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they who were in front rebuked him that he should be quiet. But he cried so much the more, Son of David! Have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>saying, What do you desire that I should do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight! Your faith has saved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And when they saw, all the people gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
