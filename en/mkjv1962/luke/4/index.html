And in those days He ate nothing. And they being ended, He afterward was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the Devil said to Him, If you are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it might become bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Devil, leading Him up into a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Devil said to Him, All this power I will give you, and the glory of them; for it has been delivered to me. And I give it to whomever I will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore if you will worship me, all shall be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, You shall worship [the] Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he brought Him to Jerusalem and sat Him on a pinnacle of the temple and said to Him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it is written, He shall give His angels charge over You, to keep You;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and in [their] hands they shall bear You up, lest at any time You dash Your foot against a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus answering said to him, It has been said, You shall not tempt [the] Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the Devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. And a report went out throughout all the neighborhood concerning Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And, as His custom was, He went in to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And [the] book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And unrolling the book, He found the place where it was written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Spirit of [the] Lord [is] on Me; because of this He has anointed Me to proclaim the Gospel to [the] poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and new sight to [the blind, to set at liberty those having been crushed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to proclaim the acceptable year of [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And rolling up the book, returning [it] to the attendant, He sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all bore witness to Him and wondered at the gracious words which came out of His mouth. And they said, Is this not Joseph's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He said to them, You will surely say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever [we] have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your native-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He said, Truly I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his native-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Elijah was not sent to any of them, except to Zarephath, [a city] of Sidon, to a woman, a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And many lepers were in Israel in the [time] of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And hearing these things, all in the synagogue were filled [with] wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they rose up and thrust Him outside the city, and led Him up to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But passing through the midst of them, He went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them [on] the sabbath days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished at His doctrine, for His word was with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon and cried out with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, Let [us] alone! What is to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown him into the midst, he came out of him, not harming him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word [is] this! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And a report about Him went out into every place of the neighborhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And rising up from the synagogue, He entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was being seized with a great fever. And they asked Him for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And standing over her, He rebuked the fever. And it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the sun sinking, all, as many as had sick ones with different kinds of diseases brought them to Him. And laying hands on each of them, He healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And also demons came out of many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! And rebuking [them], He did not allow them to speak; for they knew Him to be the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And day coming on, going out, He went into a deserted place. And the crowds looked for Him and came to Him, and held Him fast, not to pass away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He said to them, I must proclaim the gospel, the kingdom of God, to other cities, because I was sent on this [mission] ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He proclaimed in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
