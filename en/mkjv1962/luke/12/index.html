And that which you have spoken in the ear in secret rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But I will warn you of whom you shall fear: Fear Him who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yea, I say to you, fear Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? And not one of them is forgotten before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore do not fear, you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess Me before men, the Son of man also shall confess him before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he who denies Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, [it] shall not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they bring you into the synagogues, and [to] rulers and authorities, take no thought as to how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one of the company said to Him, Master, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He said to him, Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He said to them, Watch and keep yourselves from covetousness. For a man's life is not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room in which to store my fruits?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, I will do this. I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones, and I will store all my fruits and my goods there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid [up] for many years. Take your ease, eat drink [and] be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, Fool! This night your soul shall be required of you, then whose shall be those things which you have prepared?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So [is] he who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And He said to His disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious as to your life, what you shall eat; nor for the body, what you shall put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Life is more than food, and the body [is more] than clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap, having neither storehouse nor barn, and God feeds them. How much more are you better than the birds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you [by] being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If then you are not able to do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies, how they grow; they do not toil, they do not spin. And yet I say to you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If then God so clothes the grass (which today [is] in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven) how much more [will He clothe] you, O little-faiths?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And do not seek what you shall eat, nor what you shall drink, and stop being in anxiety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you have need of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But rather seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell what you have and give alms. Make for yourselves purses which do not become old, an unfailing treasure in Heaven, where no thief comes nor moth corrupts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your loins be girded about, and [your] lights burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And you yourselves be like men who wait for their lord, whenever he shall return from the wedding, so that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed [are] those servants whom the lord will find watching when [he] comes. Truly I say to you that he shall gird himself and make them recline; and coming up he will serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if he comes in the second watch, or comes in the third watch, and find [it] so, blessed are those servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be dug through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore be ready also, for the Son of man comes at an hour when you think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You speak this parable to us or also to all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom [his] lord shall set over his houseservants, to give [them their] portion of food in season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed [is] that servant [when] his lord comes [and] finds him so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that servant says in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and shall begin to beat the male servants and women servants, and to eat and drink and to be drunk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not expect, and at an hour when he does not know. And he will cut him apart, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that servant who knew his lord's will and did not prepare, nor did according to His will, shall be beaten with many [stripes].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he not knowing, and doing [things] worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few [stripes]. For to whomever much is given, of him much shall be required. And to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I have come to send fire on the earth. And what will I do if it is already kindled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed down until it is accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Do you suppose that I have come to give peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from now on, there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And He also said to the crowd, When you see a cloud rise out of the west, immediately you say, There is a shower coming. And so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when [you see] the south wind blow, you say, There will be heat; and it occurs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Hypocrites! You know to discern the face of the heaven and the earth, but how [is it] that you do not discern this time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And why, even of yourselves, do you not judge what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For as you go with your adversary to the judge, give pains in the way to be set free from him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell you, you shall not depart from there until you have paid the very last lepton.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
