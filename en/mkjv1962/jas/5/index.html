You heaped treasure in the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the hire of the laborers reaping your fields cry out, being kept back by you. And the cries of those who have reaped have entered into the ears of [the] Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have lived luxuriously on the earth, and lived wantonly. You have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned [and] murdered the just; he does not resist you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth and has long patience for it, until he receives [the] early and the latter rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You also be patient, establish your hearts, for the coming of your Lord draws near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not grudge against one another, brothers, lest you be condemned. Behold, [the] Judge stands before the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My brothers, take the prophets who have spoken in the name of [the] Lord, [for] an example of suffering ill, and of patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, we count blessed those who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all things, my brothers, do not swear; neither by the heaven nor by the earth, nor any other oath. But let your yes be yes, and [your] no, no, lest you fall into condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing psalms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the prayer of faith will cure the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up. And if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess faults to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. [The] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous one avails much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elijah was a man of like passion as we are. And he prayed earnestly [that it] might not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for the time of three years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to sprout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Brothers, if anyone among you err from the truth, and if anyone turns him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>know that he who turns back the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
