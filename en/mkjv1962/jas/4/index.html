[Is it] not from this, from your lusts which war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You desire, and do not have. You murder, and are jealous, and cannot obtain. You fight and war, yet you have not because you ask not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may spend [it] upon your lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity [with] God? Therefore whoever desires to be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us yearns to envy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But He gives more grace. Therefore He says, God resists the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, sinners; and purify your hearts, double-minded ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be afflicted, and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and [your] joy to heaviness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be humbled before the Lord, and He will lift you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against [his] brother, and who judges his brother, speaks against the Law and judges the Law. But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you who judges another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, those saying, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and spend a year there, and we will trade and will make a profit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who do not know of the morrow. For what [is] your life? For it is a vapor, which appears for a little time, and then disappears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead of you saying, If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you boast in your presumptions. All such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore to him who knows to do good, and does not do [it], to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
