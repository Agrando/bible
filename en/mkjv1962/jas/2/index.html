Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they not blaspheme that worthy Name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. But if you do not commit adultery, yet if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak and do as those who shall be judged by [the] law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he who has shown no mercy shall have judgment without mercy, and mercy exults over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My brothers, what profit [is it] if a man says he has faith and does not have works? Can faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and if one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, but you do not give them those things which are needful to the body, what good [is it] ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so, if it does not have works, faith is dead, being by itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith from my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that there is one God, you do well; even the demons believe and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you see how faith worked with his works, and from the works faith was made complete?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness, and he was called the friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see then how a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she had received the messengers and had [sent] them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
