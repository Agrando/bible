For he who doubts is like a wave of [the] sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For do not let that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>[he is] a double-minded man, not dependable in all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But let [the] humble brother rejoice in his exaltation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the rich one [rejoice] in his humiliation, because he shall pass away as the flower of the grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the sun rose with the hot wind and dried up the grass, and its flower fell out, and the beauty of its appearance perished; so also the rich one will fade away in his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed [is] the man who endures temptation, because having been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no one being tempted say, I am tempted from God. For God is not tempted by evils, and He tempts no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But each one is tempted by his lusts, being drawn away and seduced [by them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then when lust has conceived, [it] brings forth sin. And sin, when it is fully formed, brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not err, my beloved brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of [His own] will He brought us forth with [the] Word of truth, for us to be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the wrath of man does not work out [the] righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore putting aside all filthiness and overflowing of evil, receive in meekness the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But become doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if anyone is a hearer of [the] Word and not a doer, he is like a man studying his natural face in a mirror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he studied himself and went his way, and immediately [he] forgot what he was like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues [in it], he is not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of [the] work. This one shall be blessed in his doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone thinks to be religious among you, [yet] does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this one's religion [is] vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure religion and undefiled before God and [the] Father [is] this, to visit orphans and widows in their afflictions, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
