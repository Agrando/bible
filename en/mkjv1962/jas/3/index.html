If anyone does not offend in word, the same [is] a full-grown man, able also to bridle the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, so that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the ships being so great, and driven by fierce winds, yet they are turned about with a very small rudder, where the impulse of him steering desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. Behold how little a fire kindles how large a forest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity. So the tongue is set among our members, spotting all the body and inflaming the course of nature, and being inflamed by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of animals, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of sea-animals, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But no one can tame the tongue, [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By this we bless God, even [the] Father. And by this we curse men, who have come into being according to the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a fountain send forth at the same hole the sweet and the bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries; or a vine, figs? So no fountain [can] yield both salt water and fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who [is] wise and knowing among you? Let him show his works by [his] good conduct with meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and strife in your hearts, do not glory and lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This is not the wisdom coming down from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where envying and strife [are], there [is] confusion and every foul deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first truly pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And [the] fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
