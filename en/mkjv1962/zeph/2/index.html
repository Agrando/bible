It may be you shall be hidden in the day of the LORD's anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a ruin. They shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Woe [to] the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The Word of the LORD is against you: Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will destroy you, so that no inhabitant [survives].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sea coast will be pastures, meadows of shepherds, and folds for flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed on them. In the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down in the evening, for the LORD their God shall visit them and turn away their captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the curses of the sons of Ammon, [with] which they have cursed My people and have magnified [themselves] on their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, [as] I live, says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah; a possession of nettles, and salt pits, and a ruin forever. The remnant of My people shall plunder them, and the remnant of My people shall possess them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall have this for their pride, because they have cursed and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The LORD [will be] frightening to them; for He will make all the gods of the earth lean; [each] man from his place and all the coastlands of the nations shall bow to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You Ethiopians also [shall be] slain by My sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desert and dry like a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And flocks shall lie down in her midst, all the beasts of a nation; both the pelican and the bittern shall roost in the capitals of its pillars; a voice shall sing at the window, ruin [shall be] at the doorsill, for he will bare the cedar-work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This [is] the rejoicing city, dwelling confidently, who says in her heart, I [am], and no other still [is].
