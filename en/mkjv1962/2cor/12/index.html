For I will come to visions and revelations of [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know a man in Christ fourteen years before (whether in [the] body, I do not know; or outside of [the] body, I do not know; God knows) such a one [was] caught up to [the] third Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I do not know; God knows),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will glory of such a one, yet I will not boast on my behalf, except in my weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For if I desire to boast, I shall not be foolish. For I will speak the truth. But I spare, lest anyone should think of me as [being] beyond what he sees me, or hears of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and by the surpassing revelations, lest I be made haughty, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be made haughty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this thing I besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may overshadow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I am pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become foolish boasting. You compelled me. For I ought to be commended by you. For I lacked nothing of the highest apostles, if even I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in miracles and in wonders, and by works of power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is it in which you were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, a third [time] I am ready to come to you. And I will not burden you, for I do not seek your things, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls, even if loving you more and more, I am loved [the] less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But let it be so, I did not burden you. But being crafty, I caught you with bait.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By any whom I have sent to you, did I overreach you by him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I begged Titus and sent with [him] the brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we] not walk] in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, do you think we are defending ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ, but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your building up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear, lest somehow coming I might not find you as I wish, and [that] I shall be found by you such as you might not wish; lest somehow [there be] strifes, envyings, angers, contentions, backbitings, whisperings, proud thoughts, tumults;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>lest in my coming again my God will humble me with you; and I shall mourn many who have already sinned, and not repenting over the uncleanness, and fornication, and lustfulness which they have practiced.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
