But we are revealed to God, and I trust also that we are revealed in your consciences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but are giving you occasion to glory on our behalf, so that you may have [it] to [answer] those boasting in appearance, and not in heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if we are out of our mind, [it is] to God; or [if] we are in our senses, [it is] for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the love of Christ constrains us, judging this, that if one died for all, then all died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and He died for all, that the living ones may live no more to themselves, but to Him who died for them and having been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So as we now know no one according to flesh, but even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we no longer know [Him so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So that if any one [is] in Christ, [that one is] a new creature; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all things [are] of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>whereas God was in Christ reconciling [the] world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and putting the word of reconciliation in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as God exhorting through us, we beseech [you] on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For He has made Him who knew no sin, [to be] sin for us, that we might become [the] righteousness of God in Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
