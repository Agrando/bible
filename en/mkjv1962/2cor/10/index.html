If anyone has persuaded himself that he [is] Christ's, let him think this again as to himself, that as he [is] Christ's, even so we [are] Christ's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I also should boast somewhat more fully of our authority (which the Lord has given us for building up, and not for pulling you down) I will not be put to shame;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>so that I might not seem to terrify you by letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For indeed they say, the letters [are] weighty and powerful, but the bodily presence [is] weak, and his speech is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a one think this, that, such as we [are] in word by letters, being absent, such [we will be] also in deed when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we do not dare to rank or compare ourselves with some of the ones commending themselves. But they, measuring themselves among themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, are not perceptive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure distributed to us, to reach even to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we do not overstretch ourselves as [though] not reaching to you. For we also came to you in the gospel of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>not boasting beyond measure in the labors of others, but having hope that the growing faith among you will be increased according to our rule, to overflowing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to preach the gospel in that beyond you, and not to boast in another's rule in things made ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who glories, let him glory in [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For not he who commends himself is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
