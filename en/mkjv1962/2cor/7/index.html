We wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we overreached no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I do not speak [this] to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts for [us] to die together, and to live together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My boldness of speech [is] great toward you; my glorying on your behalf [is] much. I have been filled with comfort, I am overflowing with joy on all our trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For, indeed, coming into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but being troubled in every way, [with] fightings [on the] outside, and fears [on the] inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But He who comforts the lowly comforted us by the coming of Titus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And not only by his coming, but by the comfort with which he was comforted over you, telling us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret; if indeed I did regret; for I see that that letter grieved you for an hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to God, so that you might suffer loss by nothing in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the grief according to God works repentance to salvation, not to be regretted, but the grief of the world works out death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For behold this same thing (you being grieved according to God); how much it worked out earnestness in you; but [also] defense; but [also] indignation; but [also] fear; but [also desire; but [also] zeal; but  also] vengeance! In everything you approved yourselves to be clear in the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then, though I wrote to you, [it was] not on account of the one who did wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered wrong, but for the sake of revealing our earnestness on your behalf, for you before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort, and we rather rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I have boasted anything about you to him, I was not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting as to Titus became truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his tender feelings are more abundant toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, as you received him with fear and trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
