In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I told you before, and I say beforehand, as being present the second [time] and being absent now. I write to those who sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me (who is not weak toward you, but is powerful in you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for even if He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by [the] power of God. For indeed even we are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by [the] power of God toward you),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith, prove your own selves. Do you not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobates?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I pray to God [for] you not to do evil, none. And not that we may appear approved, but that you should do the good things, though we are deemed to be reprobates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For we have no power against the truth, but for the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are glad when we are weak, and you are powerful. But we pray also for this, your perfection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I write these things while absent, lest being present I may not deal sharply [with you] according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally, brothers, rejoice. Perfect yourselves; encourage yourselves; mind the same thing; be at peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the saints greet you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
