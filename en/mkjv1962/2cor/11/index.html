For I have espoused you to one Man, to present [you as] a pure virgin to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the simplicity due to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if, indeed, the [one] coming proclaims another Jesus, whom we have not proclaimed, or [if] you receive another spirit, which you did not receive, or another gospel, which you never accepted, you might well endure [these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For I judge [myself] to have come behind the highest apostles [in] nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But even if [I am] unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge; but in every way [I] have been clearly revealed to you in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Or did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I stripped other churches, taking wages for the serving of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And being present with you, and in need, I was not a burden to anyone. For the brothers from Macedonia made up completely my need. And in every way I have kept myself from being burdensome [to you], and I will keep myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The truth of Christ is in me that this boasting shall not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, that I will do, so that I may cut off occasion from those who desire occasion; so that in the thing in which they boast, they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such ones [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Did not even Satan marvelously transform himself into an angel of light?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Again I say, Let no one think me foolish. If otherwise, yet receive me as foolish, so that I may also boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I speak, I do not speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this boldness of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since many glory according to the flesh, I also will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For you gladly bear with fools, being wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you endure if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours, if anyone takes [from you], if anyone exalts himself, if anyone strikes you in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak according to dishonor, as though we have been weak. But in whatever anyone dares (I speak foolishly), I also dare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? I also! Are they Israelites? I also! Are they the seed of Abraham? I also!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as beside myself,) I [am] more! [I have been] in labors more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in prisons more, in deaths many times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Five times from the Jews I received forty [stripes] minus one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a night and a day in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have been in travels often; in dangers from waters; in dangers from robbers; in dangers from [my] race; in dangers from [the] heathen; in dangers in [the] city; in dangers in [ the] wilderness; in dangers on [the sea; in dangers among false brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>[I have been] in hardship and toil; often in watchings; in hunger and thirst; often in fastings; in cold and nakedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>besides the things outside conspiring against me daily, the care of all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If it is right to boast, I will boast [of] the things of my weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of [the] Damascenes, desiring to lay hold of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I was let down in a basket through a window through the wall, and escaped their hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
