For if I forgave anything, for your sakes I forgave [it] to him in the person of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so that we should not be overreached by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me by [the] Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother. But taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now thanks [be] to God, who always causes us to triumph in Christ, and He revealing through us the odor of the knowledge of Him in every place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are to God a sweet savor of Christ, in those being saved, and in those being lost;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to the one [we are] the savor of death to death, and to the other we are the savor of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we are not as many, hawking the Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
