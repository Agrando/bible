Save me, O God; for the waters are come even to threaten my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I am sunk in the mire of the deep, where there is no standing; I am come into the depths of the waters, and the flood overfloweth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary of my calling; my throat is hoarse; my eyes fail, while I hope for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>More than the hairs of my head are those that hate me without a cause; numerous are those that would destroy me, that are my enemies wrongfully: what I have not robbed shall I now restore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, thou art well aware of my folly, and my guilty deeds are from thee not hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not those that wait on thee, O Lord Eternal of hosts, be made ashamed through me: let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because for thy sake have I borne reproach, hath confusion covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A stranger am I become unto my brothers, and an alien unto my motherÂ’s children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because the zeal for thy house hath devoured me; and the reproaches of those that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When I wept at the fasting of my soul, it became a reproach to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when I made sackcloth my garment, I became a proverb to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those that sit in the gate talk against me; and about me make songs the drinkers of strong drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for me, I direct my prayer unto thee, O Lord, in a time of favor; O God, in the multitude of thy kindness: answer me in the truth of thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, that I may not sink: let me be delivered from those that hate me, and out of the depths of the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not the flood of waters overflow me, and let not the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit close its mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Answer me, O Lord; for thy kindness is good: according to the multitude of thy mercies turn thou unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in distress: make haste and answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: because of my enemies do thou ransom me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou well knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion: before thee are all my assailants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sick; and I waited for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they put into my food gall; and in my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>May then their table become a snare before them: and to those that are at peace, a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>May their eyes become dark, that they cannot see; and make their loins continually to waver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour out over them thy indignation, and let the heat of thy anger overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>May their palace become desolate: in their tents let no one dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whom thou hast smitten they persecute; and of the pain of those whom thou but wounded do they converse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Lay guilt upon their guilt; and let them not come into thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the righteous let them not be written down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I am poor and suffering: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the name of God with song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And this will please the Lord better than an ox or bullock having horns and cloven hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The meek will see this, and be rejoiced: ye that seek God, and your heart shall revive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the Lord listeneth unto the needy, and his prisoners he despiseth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may abide there, and have it in possession:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the seed of his servants shall inherit it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
