Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the perishable world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Both the sons of the low and the sons of the high, rich and needy, altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will incline my ear to a parable: I will open with the harp my riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my oppressors encompasseth me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Of those that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves of the multitude of their riches?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>No one can in any wise redeem his brother, nor can he give to God redemption money for himself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the ransom of their soul is too costly, and it is omitted for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And should he still live for ever? not see the pit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he must see that wise men die, that together the fool and the brutish person perish and leave to others their wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Their inward thought is, that their houses are to be for ever, their dwellingplaces, from generation to generation; they call them by their own names in various countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Nevertheless man in his splendor endureth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is their way, their folly: yet their posterity will take pleasure in their sayings. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like flocks are they thrust into the nether world; death will feed them; but the upright shall have dominion over them in that morning, and their form wasteth away in the nether world, taken away from their own dwelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether world; for he will take me away. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not thou afraid when a man becometh rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For when he dieth he can take nothing away; his glory will not descend after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For though he bless his soul during his life, and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>She shall go to the generation of his fathers, unto eternity will these never see light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Man, though in splendor, who understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. °</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
