Give ear, O my people, to my instruction: incline thy ear to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open with a parable my mouth: I will utter riddles out of ancient times;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Which we have heard and know, and which our fathers have related unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not conceal them from their children, relating to the latest generation the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful deeds which he hath done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yea, he established a testimony in Jacob, and instituted a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In order that the latest generation might know them, even the children that are to be born; that they may arise and relate them to their children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That they may place in God their hope, and not forget the doings of God, but observe his commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And that they may not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that had not directed their heart firmly, and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The children of Ephraim, like wellarmed archers, that turn round on the day of battle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Kept not the covenant of God, and in his law they refused to walk;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they forgot his deeds, as also his wonders, which he had permitted them to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In the presence of their fathers did he do wonders, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters stand upright as a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he led them with the cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the mighty deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought forth running streams out of the rock, and caused water to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But they repeated to sin yet more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they tempted God in their heart, by asking food for their desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, they spoke against God: they said, Will God be able to set in order a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed: shall he also be able to give bread? or can he provide flesh for his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, when the Lord heard this, he became wroth: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also ascended against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they had not believed in God, and had not trusted in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he ordained the skies from above, and the doors of heaven he opened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he let rain down upon them manna to eat, and the corn of heaven gave he unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Angels bread did man eat: he sent them provision to satisfaction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused an east wind to pass along the heavens; and he led forth by his strength the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he let rain upon them flesh as plentiful as the dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he let them fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they ate, and were greatly satisfied, and what they longed for he brought unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were not estranged from their longing, yet was their food in their mouth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the wrath of God ascended against them, and he slew some of the fattest of them, and the young men of Israel did he strike down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With all this they sinned again, and believed not in his wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore he caused their days to come to an end in nought, and their years in dread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he slew them, then did they seek him, and they returned and inquired earnestly after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the most high God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nevertheless they prayed insincerely to him with their mouth, and with their tongue they lied unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not firm with him, and they were not faithful in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, being merciful, forgave the iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not awaken all his fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he remembered that they are but flesh, a spirit that passeth away, and returneth not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, grieve him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea, they once more tempted God, and set limits to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They remembered not his hand, the day when he ransomed them from the adversary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When he displayed in Egypt his signs, and his wonderful tokens in the fields of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he changed their rivers into blood; and their running streams, that they could not drink of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent out among them various wild beasts, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he gave unto the cricket their products, and their labor unto the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He slew with hail their vines, and their sycamoretrees with icebolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he surrendered to the hail their cattle, and their herds to the lightnings flashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He let loose against them the fierceness of his anger, wrath and indignation, and distress, a host of angels of misfortune.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He leveled a path for his anger; he withheld not from death their soul, and their life he surrendered to the pestilence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the first of their strength in the tents of Ham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he caused his own people to depart like flocks, and guided them like a drove in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he led them in safety, so that they felt no dread; but the sea covered over their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he brought them to his holy territory, even to this mount, which his right hand had acquired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And he drove out from before them nations, and divided them by the measuringline as an inheritance, and he caused to dwell in their tents the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the most high God, and his testimonies they kept not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But swerved aside, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers; they turned about like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they provoked him to anger with their highplaces, and with their graven images they moved him to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>God heard this, and he became wroth, and felt greatly disgusted with Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he cast off the dwelling at Shiloh, the tabernacle where he had dwelt among men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And he gave up his strength unto captivity, and his glory into the adversarys hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he surrendered his people unto the sword; and with his inheritance was he wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>His young men the fire devoured; and his virgins were not demanded in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>His priests fell by the sword; and his widows did not weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then awoke the Lord as one that sleepeth, like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And he smote his enemies backward: a perpetual disgrace on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Yet was he disgusted with the tent of Joseph, and of the tribe of Ephraim he made not choice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he built like high mountains his sanctuary, like the earth which he hath founded for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And he made choice of David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From following the ewes with young he brought him, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and by the skilfulness of his hands did he lead them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
