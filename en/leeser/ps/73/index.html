Truly God is good to Israel, to such as are pure of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But as for me, it lacked but little that my feet had been moved: almost nothing was needed that my steps had slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there are no deadly fetters for them, but their strength is firm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They share not in the trouble of mortals, and with men are they not afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore is pride their neckchain: violence envelopeth them as a garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their eyes start out from fatness: they have exceeded their hearts imaginings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They scorn, and speak wickedly of oppression: loftily do they speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walketh busily on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore do his people turn away hither: and waters of a full cup are drained by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they say, How should God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these are the wicked; and yet prospering continually they increase in wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Verily in vain have I thus cleansed my heart, and have washed in innocency my hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>While I was afflicted all the day, and my chastisement came every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if I were to say, I will speak thus: behold, I would be treacherous against the generation of thy children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when I should think to know this, it would be trouble in my eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Until I enter into the sanctuary of God; and understand what their future will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Surely thou placest them on slippery spots: thou lettest them fall down into destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they perish, they come to their end with terrific events.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As a dream after awaking, O Lord, reject thou in wrath their image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it fermented in my heart, and in my reins I felt sharp thrusts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I was indeed foolish, and I knew it not: I was as a thoughtless beast with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast seized hold of me by my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>With thy counsel wilt thou guide me, and afterward take me on to glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom have I in heaven? and beside thee I desire nothing upon earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Though my flesh and my heart should fall; yet the rock of my heart, and my portion will be God for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, lo, those that are far from thee shall perish: thou destroyest every one that strayeth away from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But as regardeth me, to draw near to God is good for me: I have put in the Lord Eternal my trust, that I may relate all thy works.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
