I had waited patiently for the Lord, when he inclined himself unto me, and heard my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he brought me up out of the noiseful deep, out of the miry clay, and he set up my feet upon a rock, making firm my steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he placed in my mouth a new song, a praise unto our God: many will see it, and fear; and they will trust in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Happy is the man that maketh the Lord his trust, and turneth not unto the proud, nor such as stray aside unto lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Many things hast thou done, O Lord my God; thy wonderful deeds and thy thoughts toward usthere is none to be compared unto theewill I tell and speak of, though they are too numerous to be counted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sacrifice and meatoffering thou desirest notears hast thou hollowed out unto meburntoffering and sinoffering thou demandest not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the roll of the book it is written down for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>To fulfill thy will, O my God, do I desire; and thy law is within my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I announce thy righteousness in the great assembly: lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Lord, thou well knowest it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thy righteousness have I never hidden within my heart; thy faithfulness and thy salvation have I spoken of openly: I have not concealed thy kindness and thy truth before the great assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do thou, O Lord, not withhold thy mercies from me: let thy kindness and thy truth continually watch over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For evils without number have compassed me about; my iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see: they are more numerous than the hairs of my head; and my courage hath forsaken me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, hasten to my help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>May those be made ashamed and put to the blush together that seek after my soul to take her away: let them be driven backward and be confounded, that wish for my mishap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>May they be astonished in consequence of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But may all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee: may they say continually, The Lord be magnified,those that love thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But though I be poor and needy, the Lord will think of me: my help and my deliverer art thou: O my God, delay not.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
