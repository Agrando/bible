 And he said, I ever love thee, O Lord, my strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Praised, I cried, be the Lord, and from my enemies was I saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The bonds of death encompassed me, and the floods of destruction made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The bonds of hell encircled me: the snares of death seized on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When in my distress I called upon the Lord, and unto my God I cried: he heard from his temple my voice, and my complaint came before him, even into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then shook and trembled the earth; and the foundations of the mountains were moved; and they were shaken, because he was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Smoke went up in his anger and consuming fire out of his mouth: coals flamed forth from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he bent the heavens, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and flew along, and he flitted by upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness his hidingplace, round about him as his pavilion, dark waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From the brightness before him his thick clouds passed away, with hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Lord thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered forth his voice, with hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And then were seen the channels of the waters, and there were laid open the foundations of the world, through thy rebuke, O Lord, through the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He stretched out from above his hand, he took me; he drew me out from mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from my enemy, the strong, and from those that hated me, when they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They overcame me on the day of my calamity; but the Lord became my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he brought me forth into a large space; he delivered me, because he had delight in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the purity of my hands did he recompense me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes had I not put away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was also upright with him, and I guarded myself against my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore did the Lord recompense me according to my righteousness, according to the purity of my hands before his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the kind thou wilt show thyself kind; with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt wage a contest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou wilt indeed save the afflicted people; but haughty eyes wilt thou bring down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thou wilt cause my light to shine: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For aided by thee I run through a troop; and helped by my God I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As for God,his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried: he is a shield to all those that trust in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock beside our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He is the God that girdeth me with strength, and rendereth my way unobstructed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He maketh my feet like those of the hinds, and upon my highplaces he causeth me to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He teacheth my hands for the war, so that a brazen bow is bent by my arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And thou gavest me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand supported me: and thy meekness hath made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou enlargest my steps under me, so that my joints do not slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I pursue my enemies, and overtake them; and I return not again till I have made an end of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I crush them that they are not able to rise: they fall under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For thou hast girded me with strength for the war: thou subduest my opponents under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And my enemies thou causest to turn their back to me; and those that hate me,that I may destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They cry, but there is none to help; unto the Lord,but he answereth them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I beat them small as the dust before the wind: like the dirt in the streets do I cast them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou deliverest me from the contests of the people; thou appointest me to be the head of nations: a people that I know not shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As soon as their ear heareth they shall be obedient to me: the children of the stranger shall utter flattery unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The children of the stranger shall fade away, and come forth trembling out of their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The God that granteth me vengeance, and subdueth nations under me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>That delivereth me from my enemies: also above my opponents thou liftest me up; thou deliverest me from the man of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee among the nations, O Lord, and unto thy name will I sing praises,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>To him that maketh great the salvation of his king, and who sheweth kindness to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
