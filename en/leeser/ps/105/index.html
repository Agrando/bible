call on his name: make known among the people his deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sing unto, him, sing praises unto him: speak of all his wonderful works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Glorify yourselves in his holy name: let the heart of those rejoice that seek the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Inquire after the Lord and his strength: seek his presence evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember his wonderful works which he hath done; his tokens, and the decrees of his mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob, his elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is the Lord our God: over all the earth are his decrees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He remembereth his covenant for ever, the word which he hath commanded, to the thousandth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which he covenanted with Abraham; and his oath unto Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And which he established unto Jacob as a statute, unto Israel as an everlasting covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying, "Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, as the portion of your inheritance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they wandered from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He suffered no man to oppress them; yea, he reproved kings for their sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Saying, "Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he called for a famine over the land; every staff of bread he broke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent a man before them; for a servant was Joseph sold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They forced into fetters his feet; in iron was his body put:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Until the time that his word came to pass, when the saying of the Lord had purified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king sent and unfettered him; the ruler of people, and let him go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He appointed him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possession:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That he might bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his ancients wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then came Israel into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilely with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent Moses his servant, Aaron also whom he had made choice of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They displayed among them his effective signs, and wonders in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He changed their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the very chambers of their kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He spoke, and there came various wild beasts, lice also within all their boundary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He gave them as their rain hail, and flames of fire in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he smote their vines and their figtrees, and broke the trees within their boundary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He spoke, and the locusts came, and crickets, and that without number;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they ate up all the herbs in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he smote all the firstborn in their land, the first of all their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he brought them forth with silver and gold: and there was not one that stumbled among his tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Egypt rejoiced when they departed; for the dread of them was fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He spread out a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The people asked, and he brought quails, and with heavenly bread he satisfied them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out: they ran in the dry places like a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he remembered his holy word given to Abraham his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he brought forth his people with gladness, with joyful song his elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he gave them the lands of nations; and the labor of people they obtained as an inheritance:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So that they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Hallelujah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
