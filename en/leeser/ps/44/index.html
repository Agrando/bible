O God, with our ears have we heard, our fathers have told us, deeds which thou hadst done in their days, in times of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou, with thy hand, didst indeed drive out nations, and plant them; thou didst illtreat people, and cause them to spread out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For not by their sword did they obtain possession of the land, and their own arm brought them no victory; but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst given them thy favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thou art my King, O God: ordain salvation for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Through thee will we butt down our assailants: through thy name will we tread under foot our opponents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For not in my bow will I trust, and my sword shall not help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But thou helpest us against our assailants, and those that hate us thou puttest to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Of God we boast all the day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever.
