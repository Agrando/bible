O Lord! thou hast searched me through, and thou knowest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou indeed knowest my sitting down and my rising up, thou understandest my thinking while yet afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My walking and my lying down hast thou limited, and with all my ways art thou acquainted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For, while there is not a word on my tongue, lo, thou, O Lord, knowest it entirely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behind and before hast thou hedged me in, and thou placest upon me thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Too wonderful is such knowledge for me: it is too exalted, I cannot attain unto it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee away from thy presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I should ascend into heaven, thou art there; and if I should make my bed in the nether world, behold, thou art there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If I should lift up the wings of the morningdawn, if I should dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even there would thy hand lead me, and thy right hand would seize hold of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I said, Surely darkness shall enshroud me, and into night be turned the light about me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet even darkness can obscure nothing from thee; but the night will shine like the day; both the darkness and the light are alike to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For thou possessest my reins: thou hast covered me in my mothers womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will thank thee therefore, that I am so fearfully and wonderfully made: wonderful are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My being was not concealed from thee, when I was made in secret, when I was so to say embroidered in the lowest parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>My undeveloped substance did thy eyes see; and in thy book were all of them written downthe days which have been formed, while yet not one of them was here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And how precious are unto me thy thoughts, O God! how mightily great is their sum!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Should I count them, they would be more numerous than the sand: I awake, and I am still with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If thou wouldst but slay the wicked, O God! and ye men of blood, depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who speak of thee for a wicked end, thy enemies, that bear thy name for a vain purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, those that hate thee I ever hate, O Lord; and for those that rise up against thee do I feel loathing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>With the utmost hatred do I hate them: enemies are they become unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Search me through, O God, and know my heart; probe me, and know my thoughts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And see if there be a way of perverseness in me, and lead me on the way of eternity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
