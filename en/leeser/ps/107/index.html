for he is good; for unto eternity endureth his kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thus let the Lords redeemed say, even those whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And whom he hath gathered out of the various lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They wandered about in the wilderness, in the desert path; they could not find an inhabited city:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry and thirsty, their soul within them fainted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they cried unto the Lord when they were in distress, and out of their afflictions he delivered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he led them forth on the right way, that they might go to an inhabited city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They therefore shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and proclaim his wonders to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he satisfied the longing soul, and the hungry soul he filled with good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, bound in misery and fetters of iron; </span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because they have rebelled against the words of God, and have contemned the counsel of the Most High;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he humbled with trouble their heart; they stumbled, and there was none to help;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when they cry unto the Lord when they are in distress, he saveth them out of their afflictions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He bringeth them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and teareth their bands asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They therefore shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and proclaim his wonders to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he hath broken the doors of copper, and the bolts of iron hath he hewn asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All manner of food their soul abhorreth; and they draw near unto the gates of death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they cry unto the Lord when they are in distress, he saveth them out of their afflictions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sendeth his word and healeth them, and delivereth them from their graves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They therefore shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and proclaim his wonders to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall also sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and relate his deeds with joyful song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They who go down to the sea in ships, who do business on great waters; </span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders on the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he spoke, and he raised the stormy wind, which lifteth up its waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They would mount up to heaven, they would go down to the depths: their soul was melted because of their danger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They would reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and all their wisdom was exhausted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they cried unto the Lord when they were in distress, and he brought them out of their afflictions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He calmed the storm into a whisper, and stilled were the waves of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they were rejoiced because they were silent: and then he guided them unto their desired haven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They therefore shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and proclaim his wonders to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they must exalt him in the congregation of the people, and in the assembly of the elders must they praise him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He changeth rivers into a wilderness, and watersprings into parched ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A fruitful land into a salty waste, for the wickedness of those that dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He changeth the wilderness into a pool of water, and desert land into watersprings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there he causeth to dwell the hungry, that they may found an inhabited city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, that they may yield the fruits of the annual product.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He also blesseth them, and they multiply greatly, and he suffereth not their cattle to diminish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They were also diminished and bowed low through oppression, misfortune, and sorrow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He then poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in a pathless wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he exalteth the needy from misery, and maketh his families like flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The righteous shall see it, and rejoice; but all wickedness shall stop her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Whoever is wise, let him observe these things, and let all understand the kindness of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
