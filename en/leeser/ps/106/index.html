Oh give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for to eternity endureth his kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can publish all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Happy are those that observe justice, that execute righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O Lord, when thou favorest thy people: oh visit me with thy salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That I may look on the happiness of thy elect, that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, that I may glorify myself with thy inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned together with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers did not reflect on thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy kindnesses; but rebelled at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless he saved them for the sake of his name, to make known his might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; and he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their adversaries: not one of them was left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then believed they in his words, they sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Speedily they forgot his works, they waited not for his counsel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they felt a lustful longing in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave them what they had asked; but sent dryness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered over the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed themselves down to a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they exchanged their glory for the similitude of an ox that eateth herbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wonders in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He therefore spoke of destroying them: had not Moses his elect stood in the breach before him, to turn away his fury, that he might not destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they despised the pleasant land, they believed not in his word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He therefore lifted up his hand against them, to cause them to fall in the wilderness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And to let their seed fall among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they joined themselves unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they provoked him to anger with their deeds: and there broke in among them the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it was accounted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, and evil happened to Moses for their sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because they had embittered his spirit, and so he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not exterminate the nations, that the Lord had indicated to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But they mingled themselves among the nations, and learned their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they served their idols, and these became unto them a snare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto the evil spirits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with bloodguiltiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus were they made unclean through their own doings, and went astray with their own deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and be felt disgust for his own inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave them up into the hand of the nations: and there ruled over them those that hated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And their enemies also oppressed them: and they were subdued under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times did he deliver them; but they rebelled with their counsel, and they were brought low through their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless he looked on when they were in distress, when he heard their entreaty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he remembered unto them his covenant, and he bethought himself according to the abundance of his kindnesses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And be caused them to find mercy before all those that had carried them away captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, to triumph in thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting even to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen, Hallelujah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
