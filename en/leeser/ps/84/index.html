How lovely are thy dwellingplaces, O Lord of hosts!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>My soul desired, yea, it also longed for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh shout with joy unto the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even as the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young:have I found thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Happy are they who dwell in thy house: they will be continually praising thee.
