And now reflect what word I shall bring back to him that hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall then into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are very great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel, and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was destroying, the Lord looked on, and he bethought himself of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough: now stay thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord standing between the earth and the heavens, with his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. Then fell David, with the elders wrapt in sackcloth, upon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said unto God, Was it not I that ordered to count the people? and I am the one that have sinned and have done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have they done? O Lord my God, let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my fathers house, but not against thy people, that there should be a plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the angel of the Lord spoke to Gad to say to David, that David should go up, to erect an altar unto the Lord on the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David went up by the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when Ornan turned back, and saw the angel, then did he and his four sons with him hide themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as David came up to Ornan, Ornan looked up and saw David; and he went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said David to Ornan, "Grant me the site of this threshingfloor, that I may build thereon an altar unto the Lord: for the full price shalt thou give it unto me, so that the plague may be stayed from the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Ornan said unto David, Take it for thyself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes: lo, I give the oxen for burntofferings, and the threshingrollers for wood, and the wheat for the meatoffering; the whole do I give thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And king David said to Ornan, No: but I will surely buy it at the full value; for I will not take what is thine for the Lord, so as to offer burntofferings without paying therefore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burntofferings and peaceofferings, and he called on the Lord: and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burntoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Lord spoke to the angel, and he put back his sword into its sheath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then did he sacrifice there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burntoffering, were at that time in the highplace at Gibon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But David was not able to go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
