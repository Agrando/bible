since thou knowest well thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, for the sake of thy servant, and in accordance with thy own heart, hast thou done all this great thing, to make known all these great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Lord, there is none like thee, and there is no god beside thee, in accordance with all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And who is like thy people Israel, the only nation on the earth which God went to redeem for himself as a people, to acquire for thyself a name for great and terrible deeds, by driving out nations from before thy people, which thou hadst redeemed out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou hast instituted thy people Israel unto thyself as a people for ever; and thou, Lord, art indeed become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now, O Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be verified for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yea, let it be verified, and let thy name be magnified unto everlasting, that men may say, The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God for Israel; and may the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For thou, O my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build for him a house; therefore hath thy servant found himself able to pray before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, O Lord, thou art the true God, and thou hast spoken concerning thy servant this goodness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And now hast thou been pleased to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord, hast blessed, and it will remain blessed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
