and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Seven days shalt thou make an atonement upon the altar and sanctify it; and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And this is what thou shalt offer upon the altar: Two sheep of the first year for every day, continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The one sheep shalt thou offer in the morning; and the other sheep shalt thou offer toward evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And a tenth part of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drinkoffering, shall be for the one sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the other sheep shalt thou offer toward evening; according to the meatoffering of the morning, and according to its drinkoffering shalt thou do unto it, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>A continual burntoffering throughout your generations shall this be at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord; where I will meet with you, to speak unto thee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And I will meet there with the children of Israel, and it shall be sanctified by my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: and both Aaron and his sons will I sanctify, that they may he priests unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and I will be to them for a God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they shall know that I am the Eternal, their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am the Lord their God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
