he shall make full restitution; if he have nothing, then shall he be sold for his theft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If the thing stolen be actually found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall restore double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If a man cause a field or vineyard to be eaten off, and he let his beasts enter, and they feed in another mans field; with the best of his own field, and with best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a fire break out, and meet with thorns, so that stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed thereby, he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man do deliver unto his neighbor money or vessels to keep, and it be stolen out of the mans house: if the thief be found, he shall pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the thief be not found, then shall the master of the house be brought unto the judges, to swear that he have not stretched out his hand against his neighbors goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all manner of trespass, for ox, for ass, for lamb, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, of which he can say, This is it, before the judges shall come the cause of both parties, and he, whom the judges may condemn, shall pay double unto his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a lamb, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both, that he have not stretched out his hand against his neighbors goods; and the owner of it shall accept this, and he shall not make it good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it as evidence; that which was torn he shall not make good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make it good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good; if it be a hired thing, the loss is included in its hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man seduce a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If her father refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a stranger thou shalt not vex, and shalt not oppress him; for strangers ye were in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou afflict him in any wise; for if he cry at all unto me, I will surely hear his cry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My wrath shall wax hot, and I will slay you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If thou lend money to my people, to the poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a lender of money; thou shalt not lay upon him usury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If thou take at all thy neighbors raiment in pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by the time the sun goeth down;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is his only covering, it is his raiment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The judges thou shalt not revile; and a ruler among thy people thou shalt not curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors, shalt thou not delay to offer; the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In like manner shalt thou do with thy ox, with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And holy men shall ye be unto me: and flesh that is torn of beasts in the field, shall ye not eat; to the dogs shall ye cast it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
