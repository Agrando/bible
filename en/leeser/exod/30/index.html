and two cubits shall be its height; from itself shall its horns be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And two rings of gold shalt thou make for it beneath its crown, on its two corners shalt thou make them, upon both its sides;
