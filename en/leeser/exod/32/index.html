Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent thee of the evil decreed against thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear by thy own self, and speak unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven; and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord bethought himself of the evil which he had spoken to do unto his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turned about, and went down from the mount with the two tables of the testimony in his hand: tables inscribed on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they inscribed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua heard the noise of the people in its shouting, and he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, It is not the voice of a shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of a cry for defeat; the noise of singing do I hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when he came nigh unto the camp, and he saw the calf, and the dancing: that the anger of Moses waxed hot, and he cast from his hands the tables, and broke them at the foot of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in fire, and ground it to a powder, and he strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, What hath this people done unto thee, that thou hast brought upon it so great a sin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my Lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that it is bent on mischief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they said unto me, Make us gods that shall go before us; for of this man Moses, who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I said unto them, Who hath any gold? They took it off themselves and gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses saw the people that it had become unruly; for Aaron had made it unruly for a disgrace among their opponents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moses then placed himself in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is on the Lords side, let him come unto me! and there assembled themselves unto him all the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said unto them, Thus hath said the Eternal, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword by his side, and go ye hither and thither, from gate to gate in the camp, and slay ye every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his relative.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people on that day about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, yea even every man on his son, and on his brother; and to bestow upon you this day a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the Lord; peradventure I may obtain an atonement for your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people hath sinned a great sin, and they have made themselves gods of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin; but if not, blot me out, I pray thee, from thy book which thou hast written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out from my book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, my angel shall go before thee; but on the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the Lord sent a plague among the people, because that they had made the calf which Aaron made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
