and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he was the husband of a woman, then shall his wife go out with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If his master should give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters: the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if the servant should plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then shall his master bring him unto the judges, and he shall bring him to the door, or unto the doorpost; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him till the jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if a man sell his daughter for a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If she please not her master, to whom he hath assigned her, then shall he aid her to be redeemed: unto a strange nation he shall have no power to sell her, seeing he hath dealt faithlessly with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he should assign her unto his son, then shall he do unto her after the right of the daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he take himself another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out free, without money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he did not lie in wait, but God let it come into his hand, then will I appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile, from my altar shalt thou take him, that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, and he be found in his hand, shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if men strive together, and one smite the other with a stone, or with the fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his crutch, then shall he that smote him be quit; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if a man smite his servant or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand, it shall be surely avenged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless, if he continue alive a day or two, it shall not be avenged; for he is his money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her children depart from her, and yet no farther mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, with a fine, according as the husband of the woman will lay upon him; and he shall pay this by the decision of the judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if any mischief follow, then shalt thou give life for life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Burning for burning, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish, he shall let him go free for the sake of his eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if he strike out his manservants tooth, or his maidservants tooth, he shall let him go free for the sake of his tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If an ox gore a man or a woman, that he die: then shall the ox be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But if the ox were wont to gore in time past, and warning have been given to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, and he killeth a man or a woman: the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also should of right be put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But there shall be laid on him a sum of money in atonement, and he shall give the ransom of his life whatsoever may be laid upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If he gore a son, or gore a daughter, according to this judgment shall be done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If the ox gore a manservant or a maidservant, thirty shekels of silver shall he give to his master, and the ox shall be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a man open a pit, or if a man dig a pit, and do not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The owner of the pit shall make it good, he shall make restitution in money unto the owner thereof; and the dead beast shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if one mans ox hurt the ox of another, that he die: then shall they sell the live ox, and divide his money; and the dead ox also they shall divide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in: he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall belong to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
