and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony; and thou shalt put up the hanging at the door to the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou shalt set the altar of burntoffering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou shalt set the laver between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou shalt set up the court round about, and put up the hanging at the gate of the court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein; and thou shalt hallow it, with all its vessels, and it shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shalt anoint the altar of burntoffering, and all its vessels; and thou shalt sanctify the altar, and the altar shall be most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thou shalt anoint the laver with its foot, and sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shalt bring near Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thou shalt clothe Aaron with the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may be a priest unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his sons shalt thou bring near, and clothe them with coats:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou hast anointed their father, that they may be priests unto me; and this shall be, that their anointing shall be unto them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses did so; all, just as the Lord had commanded him, so did he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and placed its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it above; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and placed the staves on the ark; and he put the mercyseat upon the ark above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the separation, and made therewith a separation for the ark of the testimony; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he put the table in the tabernacle of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle, northward, without the vail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he arranged upon it the order of bread before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he placed the candlestick in the tabernacle of the congregation, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle, southward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he lighted the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he placed the golden altar in the tabernacle of the congregation before the vail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he burnt thereon the incense of spices; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he put up the hanging at the door to the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the altar of burntoffering he placed by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation; and he offered upon it the burntoffering and the meatoffering; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, for washing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed therefrom their hands and their feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When they went in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed themselves; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and put up the hanging of the gate of the court; and so did Moses finish the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation; because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel were wont to go onward in all their journeyings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that is was taken up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and a fire was by night on it, before the eyes of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeyings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
