what is this which thou hast done to us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not this the word that we spoke unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will do for you today; for as ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall not see them again any more for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Lord will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But do thou lift up thy staff, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I, behold, I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get myself honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have got myself honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel of God, that went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to the first, but it gave light by night to these: and the one came not near unto the other all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them, on their right hand, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them, all Pharaohs horses, his chariots, and his horsemen, to the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass in the morning watch, that the Lord looked unto the camp of the Egyptians with the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and brought into confusion the camp of the Egyptians;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he took off the wheels of their chariots, and caused them to move onward with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, and the waters shall return over the Egyptians, over their chariots, and over their horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned, when the morning appeared, to its strength; while the Egyptians were fleeing against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen with all the host of Pharaoh that came after them into the sea: there remained of them not even one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the children of Israel walked upon dry ground in the midst of the sea; and the waters were unto them a wall on their right hand, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus the Lord saved Israel on that day out of the land of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw that great power which the Lord had shown on the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and then believed in the Lord, and in Moses his servant.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
