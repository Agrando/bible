and these brought unto him yet more freewill offerings morning after morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And then came all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, every man from his own work which they were doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they said unto Moses, thus, The people bring more than is required for the service of the work, which the Lord hath commanded to make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses gave the command, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary: so the people were restrained from bringing more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the stuff prepared was sufficient for all the work to make it, and there was some over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the wisehearted men, among those who wrought the work, made the tabernacle of ten curtains; of twisted linen thread, and blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn; with cherubim, of weavers work, made he them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The length of each curtain was twentyeight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: there was one measure for all the curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he coupled together five of the curtains one to another: and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain, which was the outside in the coupling: the like he made on the border of the curtain, which was the outmost on the second coupling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fifty loops made he on the one curtain, and fifty loops made he on the edge of the curtain which was in the second coupling: the loops were fixed opposite to each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he made fifty hooks of gold; and he coupled the curtains together one unto the other with the hooks, and the tabernacle became thus one piece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he made curtains of goats hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains made he the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of each curtain: there was one measure for the eleven curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he coupled five of the curtains by themselves, and six of the curtains by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was the outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he on the edge of the curtain of the second coupling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he made fifty hooks of copper, to couple the tent together that it might be one piece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he made a covering for the tent of rams skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers skins above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of shittim wood, standing up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ten cubits was the length of each board, and one cubit and a half was the breadth of each one board.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There were two tenons for every board, fitted in, one against the other: the like made he for all the boards of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side, on the right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And forty sockets of silver made he under the twenty boards; two sockets under the one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under the other board for its two tenons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And for the other side of the tabernacle, for the north side, he made twenty boards:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under the other board.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And for the back wall of the tabernacle, westward, he made six boards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the back wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they were closely fitting beneath, and they were closely joined together on the top, by means of one ring; thus he did to both of them, for both the corners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And so there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two sockets under every board.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he made bars of shittim wood; five, for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the back wall, westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he made the middle bar to pass through the midst of the boards from the one end to the other end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the boards he overlaid with gold, and their rings he made of gold, as receptacles for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and twisted linen; of weavers work made he it, with cherubim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, their hooks also were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he made a hanging for the door of the tabernacle, of blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and twisted linen; the work of the embroiderer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And its five pillars with their hooks: and he overlaid their tops and made their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of copper.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
