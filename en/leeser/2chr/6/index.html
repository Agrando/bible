nor did I make choice of any man to be a ruler over my people of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I have made choice of Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and I have made choice of David to be over my people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well in that it was in thy heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nevertheless thou shalt not thyself build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Lord hath fulfilled his word that he hath spoken; and I am risen up in the stead of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord hath spoken, and I have built the house unto the name of the Lord the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I have placed there the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord which he hath made with the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he now placed himself before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For Solomon had made a laver of copper, and had placed it in the midst of the outcourt, five cubits being its length, five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height; and he placed himself upon it, and kneeled down upon his knees in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, O Lord God of Israel, there is no god like thee in the heavens, or on the earth, thou who keepest the covenant, and the kindness for thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who has kept for thy servant David my father that which thou hadst promised him; and thou spokest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for thy servant David my father that which thou hast spoken concerning him, saying, There shall never fail thee a man in my sight who sitteth on the throne of Israel, if thy children but take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, O Lord, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant, unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, in truth, will God then dwell with men on the earth? behold, the heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot contain thee: how much less then this house that I have built!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet wilt thou turn thy regard unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to listen unto the entreaty and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That thy eyes may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place of which thou hast said that thou wouldst put thy name there; that thou mayest listen unto the prayer which thy servant will pray at this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And listen thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they will pray at this place: and oh, do thou hear from thy dwellingplace, from heaven;

for thou wilt direct them unto the good way, wherein they should walk; and give then rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, blasting, or mildew, if there be locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in their land, in their gates at whatsoever plague, and at whatsoever sickness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>What prayer and what supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, when they shall be conscious every man of his plague and his pain, and he then spread forth his hands toward this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then do thou hear from heaven the place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and give to every man in accordance with all his ways, as thou mayest know his heart; for thou, thyself alone, knowest the heart of the children of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In order that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, all the days that they live on the face of the land which thou hast given unto our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But also to the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a faroff country for the sake of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thy outstretched arm, if they come and pray in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Mayest thou likewise listen from heaven, from the place of thy dwelling, and do according to all that the stranger will call on thee for: in order that all people of the earth may know thy name, both to fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and to understand that this house, which I have built, is called by thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If thy people go out to battle against their enemies on the way on which thou mayest send them, and they do pray unto thee in the direction of this city which thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have built unto thy name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and procure them justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If they sin against theefor there is no man that may not sin,and thou be angry with them, and give them up before the enemy, so that their captors carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And if they then take it to their heart in the land whither they have been carried captive, and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, and have acted wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have been carried captive, and they pray in the direction of their land, which thou hast given unto their fathers, and of the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built unto thy name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then hear thou from heaven, from the place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and procure them justice, and forgive thy people for what they have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now, my God, let I beseech thee, thy eyes be open, and thy ears be attentive unto the prayer on this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And now arise, O Lord God, unto thy restingplace, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, clothe themselves with salvation, and let thy pious servants rejoice in happiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>O Lord God, turn not away the face of thy anointed: remember the pious deeds of David thy servant.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
