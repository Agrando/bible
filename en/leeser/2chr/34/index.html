And they brought the king word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king went up into the house of the Lord, with all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, from the great to the small; and he read before their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king stood up on his stand, and he made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he caused to accede to it every one that was present in Jerusalem and Benjamin. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Josiah removed all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and caused all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. All his days did they not depart from following the Lord God of their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
