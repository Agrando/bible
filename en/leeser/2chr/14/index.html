In his days the land had repose ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Assa did what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he removed the altars of the strange gods, and the highplaces, and broke up the statues, and cut down the groves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he ordered Judah to seek the Lord the God of their fathers, and to execute the law and the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also he removed out of all the cities of Judah the highplaces and the sunimages: and the kingdom had repose before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land had repose, and no one had war with him in those years; because the Lord had given him rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls, and towers, gates, and bars: the land is yet before us; because we have sought the Lord our God,we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Assa had an army that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came out against them Zerach the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand times thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came as far as Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then went Assa out against him, and they set themselves in battlearray in the valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Assa called unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, nothing can hinder thee to help, whether it be the mighty, or those that have no power: help us, O Lord our God; for on thee do we rely, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God! no mortal can place a restraint against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thereupon did the Lord strike down the Ethiopians before Assa, and before Judah: and the Ethiopians fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Assa and the people that were with him pursued them as far as Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many, that they could not recover themselves; for they were broken down before the Lord, and before his camp; and they carried away exceedingly much booty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the dread of the Lord was upon them: and they plundered all the cities; for abundant spoil was in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And also the tents of the owners of cattle did they smite, and they carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
