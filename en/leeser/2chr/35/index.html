And so did they with the steers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they roasted the passover by the fire in accordance with the prescribed manner; but the holy offerings they seethed in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the sons of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burntofferings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the singers the sons of Assaph were on their station, according to the command of David, and Assaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the kings seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate: they had no need to depart from their service; because their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So was established all the service of the Lord on the same day, to prepare the passoversacrifice, and to offer burntofferings upon the altar of the Lord, according to the command of king Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel that were present prepared the passoversacrifice at that time, and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there was not holden any passover like this in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; and all the kings of Israel did not keep such a passover as Josiah kept, with the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover holden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After all this, when Josiah had restored the temple, came up Necho the king of Egypt to fight against Karkemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war, and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God who is with me, that he may not destroy thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless did Josiah not turn his face away from him, but disguised himself, to fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God; and he came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the archers shot at king Josiah: and the king said to his servants, Carry me away: for I am sorely wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his servants carried him away out of that chariot, and conveyed him in the second chariot that he had: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and they instituted them as a custom in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his pious deeds, in accordance with what is written in the law of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And his acts, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
