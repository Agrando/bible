couches of gold and silver, upon a pavement of green, and white, and yellow, and black marble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they gave them to drink in vessels of gold,the vessels being diverse one from the other,and the royal wine was in abundance, according to the ability of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the drinking was, according to the kings order, without compulsion; for so had the king enjoined on all the officers of his house, to do according to the pleasure of every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women, in the royal house which belonged to king Achashverosh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Charbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of king Achashverosh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To bring Vashti the queen before the king ornamented with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was handsome in appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But queen Vashti refused to come at the word of the king brought by the hand of the chamberlains; and the king was very wroth, and his fury burnt in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said the king to the wise men, who knew the occurrences of the times; for so came every affair of the king before all acquainted with law and state institutions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And those next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tharshish, Meress, Marsena, and Memuchan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who could see at all times the kings face, who sat in the first rank in the kingdom:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What should according to law be done with queen Vashti; because she had not fulfilled the order of king Achashverosh by the hand of the chamberlains?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Memuchan before the king and the princes, Not against the king alone hath Vashti the queen done wrong, but also against all the princes, and against all the people that are in all the provinces of king Achashverosh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the conduct of the queen will go abroad unto all the women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, King Achashverosh ordered Vashti the queen to be brought into his presence, but she came not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And even this day will the ladies of Persia and Media, who have heard of the conduct of the queen, say this unto all the princes of the king; and there will arise too much contempt and quarrel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If it please the king, let there go forth a royal order from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that no one transgress it, That Vashti come no more before king Achashverosh: and let the king give her royal dignity unto another that is better than she.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the kings decree which he will make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, however great it is: all the wives will show respect to their husbands, unto every one, from the great even to the small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the speech was pleasing in the eyes of the king and of the princes; and the king did according to the speech of Memuchan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he sent letters unto all the provinces of the king, unto every province according to its writing, and to every people according to its language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, however he may speak according to the language of his people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
