The word had just come out of the kings mouth, when they covered Hamans face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Charbonah, one of the chamberlains, before the king, Behold, there is also the gallows, which Haman hath had made for Mordecai, who hath spoken well for the king, standing in the house of Haman, fifty cubits high. And the king said, Hang him thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the fury of the king was appeased.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
