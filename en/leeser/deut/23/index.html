even the tenth generation of him shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; even the tenth generation of him shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord, for ever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the reason, that they met you not with bread and with water on the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because he hired against thee Bilam the son of Beor of Pethor in Mesopotamia, to curse thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Bilam; and the Lord thy God changed unto thee the curse into a blessing, because the Lord thy God loved thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou shalt not seek their peace and their welfare all thy days, for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The children that are born unto them in the third generation, may enter of them into the congregation of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When thou goest forth into camp against thy enemies, then keep thyself from every evil thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If there be among thee any man, that is not clean by reason of an occurrence by night; then shall he go abroad to without the camp, he shall not come within the camp;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But it shall be, that toward evening he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun goeth down, he may come into the midst of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And a place shalt thou have without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a spade shalt thou have with thy weapons: and it shall be, when thou sittest abroad, that thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt afterward cover that which cometh from thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee and to give up thy enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy; that he see no unseemly thing in thee, and turn away from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant who may escape unto thee from his master;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>With thee shall he dwell, in the midst of thee, in the place which he may choose in any one of thy gates, where it seemeth best to him: thou shalt not oppress him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There shall not be a prostitute of the daughters of Israel, and there shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow; for both of these are equally an abomination unto the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou shalt not take interest from thy brother, interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon interest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From an alien thou mayest take interest; but from thy brother thou shalt not take interest; in order that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the acquisition of thy hand, in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When thou makest a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if thou forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>What is gone out of thy lips shalt thou keep and perform, as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God voluntarily, as thou hast spoken with thy mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When thou comest into thy neighbors vineyard, thou mayest eat grapes at thy own pleasure, till thou have enough; but into thy vessel shalt thou not put any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbor, thou mayest pluck ears with thy hand; but a sickle shall thou not move over thy neighbors standing corn.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
