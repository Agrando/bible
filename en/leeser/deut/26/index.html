and thou shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God will choose to let his name dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And thou shalt come unto the priest that may be in those days, and thou shalt say unto him, I give thanks this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come into the land which the Lord swore unto our fathers to give to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And thou shalt commence and say before the Lord thy God, A Syrian, wandering about, was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a family few in number, and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and numerous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Egyptians treated us ill, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard labor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And then we cried unto the Eternal, the God of our fathers;
