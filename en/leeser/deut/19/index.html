whereas he deserveth not a judgment of death, inasmuch as he was not an enemy to him in time past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore do I command thee, saying, Three cities shalt thou set apart for thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy boundary, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he hath spoken to give unto thy fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because thou dost keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to walk in his ways all the days: then shalt thou add for thyself three cities more, unto these three;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and bloodguiltiness be brought upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if any man be an enemy to his neighbor, and he lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he die, and he flee unto one of these cities:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall the elders of his city send and fetch him thence, and they shall deliver him into the hand of the avenger of the blood, that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thy eye shall not look with pity on him; but thou shalt put away the shedding of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt not remove the landmark of thy neighbor, which they of old time have set, in thy inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There shall not rise up one single witness against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: upon the evidence of two witnesses, or upon the evidence of three witnesses, must a case be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If a witness of violence rise up against any man to testify against him for any wrong:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then shall both the men, who have the controversy, stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges, who shall be in those days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the judges shall inquire diligently; and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, he hath testified a falsehood against his brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother; and thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those who remain shall hear, and be afraid, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil thing in the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thy eye shall have no pity;
