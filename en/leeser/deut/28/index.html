because there is nothing left unto him, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thy enemy will distress thee in all thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The woman, the most tender among thee, and the most delicate, who hath never adventured to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness,her eye shall look enviously toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And toward her young one that is come from between her feet, and toward her children which she hath born; for she shall eat them for want of every thing secretly, in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thy enemy will distress thee in thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law which are written in this book; to fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then will the Lord render peculiar thy plagues, and the plagues of thy seed, plagues great, and of long continuance, and sicknesses sore, and of long continuance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he will bring back upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, of which thou wast afraid; and they shall cleave unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also every sickness, and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And ye shall be left but few in number, instead of that ye once were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall come to pass, that, as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so will the Lord rejoice over you to bring you to nought, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And the Lord will scatter thee among all the nations, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there wilt thou serve strange gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall not be any rest for the sole of thy foot: and the Lord will give thee there a trembling heart, and a failing of eyes, and a faintness of soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt be in dread day and night, and thou shalt have no confidence of thy life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning thou wilt say, Who would but grant that it were only evening! and at evening thou wilt say, Who would but grant that it were only morning! from the dread of thy heart which thou wilt experience, and from the sight of thy eyes which thou wilt see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And the Lord will bring thee back to Egypt in ships, by the way whereof I have spoken unto thee, Thou shalt no more see it again: and there will ye offer yourselves for sale unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, without any one to buy you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
