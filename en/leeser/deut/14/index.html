unclean are they unto you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you; of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their dead carcass shall ye not touch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This may ye eat of all that is in the waters: all that hath fins and scales may ye eat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whatsoever hath not fins and scales shall ye not eat; it is unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Every clean bird may ye eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these are they which ye shall not eat of them: The eagle, and the ossifrage, and the osprey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And every raven after his kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the ostrich, and the nighthawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The little owl, and the great owl and the swan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the pelican, and the giereagle, and the cormorant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the stork, and the heron after his kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And every winged insect is unclean unto you: it shall not be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All clean fowls may ye eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye shall not eat any thing that dieth of itself: unto the stranger that is in thy gates canst thou give it, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien; for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God; thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mothers milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou shalt truly tithe all the produce of thy seed, which the field bringeth forth year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he will choose to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thy oil, and the firstborn of thy herds and of thy flocks; in order that thou may learn to fear the Lord thy God all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; because the place is too far from thee, which the Lord thy God will choose to set his name there, because the Lord thy God will bless thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and thou shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God will choose;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And thou shalt lay out that money for whatsoever thy soul longeth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat it there before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thy household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Levite, who is within thy gates, him shalt thou not forsake; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At the end of three years shalt thou bring forth all the tithe of thy produce in the same year, and thou shalt lay it down within thy gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And then shall come the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, with the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, and they shall eat and be satisfied; in order that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
