for them the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the Lord; and after their decision shall be done at every controversy and every injury;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all the elders of that city who are nearest unto the slain person shall wash their hands over the heifer, the neck of which is broken in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall commence and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, and our eyes have not seen it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Grant pardon unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, O Lord, and lay not innocent blood in the midst of thy people Israel: and the blood shall be forgiven unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou shalt put away the guilt of the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou wilt do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When thou goest forth to war against thy enemies, and the Lord thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou takest captives of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thou seest among the captives a woman of handsome form, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldst take her to thee for wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shalt thou bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and let grow her nails;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And she shall put off the raiment of her captivity from her, and she shall remain in thy house, and weep for her father and her mother a full month; and after that thou mayest go in unto her, and be her husband, that she may become thy wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then shalt thou let her go whither she will; but thou shalt nowise sell her for money; thou shalt not make a servant of her, because thou hast humbled her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a man have two wives, one beloved, and the other hated, and they bear him children, both the beloved and the hated; so that the firstborn son be hers that is hated:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then shall it be, when he divideth as inheritance among his sons what he hath, that he shall not institute the son of the beloved as the firstborn before the son of the hated, the firstborn;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the firstborn, the son of the hated woman, shall he acknowledge, to give him a double portion of all that is found in his possession; for he is the beginning of his strength; to him belongeth the right of the first birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who hearkeneth not to the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and they chastise him, and he will not hearken unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not hearken to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; and thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if a man have committed a sin for which there is a punishment of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then shall his body not remain all night on the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him on that day; for he that is hanged is a dishonor of God;and thou shalt not defile thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
