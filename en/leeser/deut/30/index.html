and he will again gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If thy outcasts be at the outmost parts of heaven, from there will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from there will he fetch thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, in order that thou mayest live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord thy God will put all these denunciations upon thy enemies, and on those that hate thee, who have persecuted thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou wilt return and hearken unto the voice of the Lord, and thou wilt do all his commandments which I command thee this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord thy God will make thee preÂ–eminent in every work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good; for the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If thou wilt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou wilt return unto the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, nor is it far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is not in heaven; that thou shouldst say, Who will go up for us to heaven, and fetch it down unto us, and cause us to hear it, that we may do it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Neither is it beyond the sea; that thou shouldst say, Who will go over the sea for us, and fetch it unto us, and cause us to hear it, that we may do it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See, I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and the evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances; that thou mayest live and multiply; and that the Lord thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if thy heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hearken, and thou sufferest thyself to be drawn away, and thou bowest down to other gods, and servest them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I announce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not remain many days upon the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go thither to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose thou life, in order that thou mayest live, both thou and thy seed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To love the Lord thy God, to hearken to his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
