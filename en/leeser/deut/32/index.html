and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as heavy rains upon the grass, and as showers upon herbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When I call on the name of the Lord, ascribe ye greatness unto our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are just: the God of truth and without iniquity, just and upright is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The corruption is not his, it is the defect of his children, of the perverse and crooked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Will ye thus requite the Lord, O people, worthless and unwise? is he not thy father who hath bought thee? is it not he who hath made thee, and established thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember the days of old, consider the years of former generations; ask thy father, and he will tell thee; thy elders, and they will say it unto thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of man: he set the bounds of the tribes according to the number of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the portion of the Lord is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He found him in a desert land, and in the waste of the howling of the wilderness; he encircled him, he watched him, he guarded him as the apple of his eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As an eagle stirreth up his nest, fluttereth over his young, spreadeth abroad his wings, seizeth them, beareth them aloft on his pinions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So did the Lord alone lead him, and there was not with him a stranger god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He caused him to stride on the high places of the earth, and he ate the products of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cream of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and of the blood of the grape thou drunkest unmixed wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus did Yeshurun grow fat, and he kicked; thou art grown fat, thick, fleshy;and then he forsook the God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They incensed him with strange gods, with abominations they provoked him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They sacrificed unto evil spirits, things that are not god, gods that they know not, new ones lately come up, which your fathers dreaded not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of the Rock that begat thee thou wast unmindful, and forgottest the God that had brought thee forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Lord saw this, and he was angry; because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be; for a perverse generation are they, children in whom there is no faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have moved me to wrath with things that are not god; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities; and I too will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a worthless nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a fire is kindled in my anger, and it burneth unto the lowest deep; and it consumeth the earth with her products, and it setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will heap upon them miseries; all my arrows will I spend upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter deadly disease; also the tooth of beasts will I let loose against them, with the poison of serpents that crawl in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Without shall the sword destroy, and terror within the chambers, both the young man and the virgin, the suckling with the man of gray hairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I said, I would drive them into one corner, I would cause their remembrance to cease from among men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their oppressors should mistake the truth, lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not wrought all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For a nation void of counsel are they, and there is no understanding in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If they were but wise, they would understand this, they would consider their latter end!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had delivered them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For not as our Rock is their rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For from the vine of Sodom is their vine, and from the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, they bear bitter clusters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The poison of serpents is their wine, and the deadly venom of asps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Behold! this is laid up in store with me, it is sealed up among my treasures!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Mine are vengeance and recompense, at the time that their foot shall slip; for nigh draweth the day of their calamity, and the future speedeth along for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the Lord will espouse the cause of his people, and bethink himself concerning his servants: when he seeth that their power is gone, and the guarded and fortified axe no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then will he say, Where are their gods, the rock in whom they trusted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They that ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drinkofferings? let them arise and help you, let them be a protection over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See now that I, even I, am he, ard there is no god with me: I alone kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; and no one can deliver out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When I whet my glittering sword, and my hand taketh hold on judgment: I will render vengeance unto my enemies, and those that hate me will I requite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will make my arrows drunken with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; from the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the crushed head of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Speak aloud, O ye nations, the praises of his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and vengeance will he render to his adversaries, and forgive his land, and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when Moses had made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify against you this day, so that ye may command them your children, to observe to do all the words of this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For it is not a vain word for you; on the contrary, it is your life; and through this word shall ye live many days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the Lord spoke unto Moses on that selfsame day, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is in front of Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And die on the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died on mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of contention at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from afar shalt thou see the land; but thither shalt thou not go unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
