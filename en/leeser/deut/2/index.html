And we turned and passed the way of the wilderness of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said unto me, Do not attack the Moabites, nor contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee from their land any inheritance, because unto the children of Lot have I given Ar for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Emim in times past dwelt therein, a people great, and numerous, and tall as the Anakim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As Rephaim were also they accounted, equally with the Anakim; and the Moabites called the m Emim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in Seir dwelt the Chorim in times past; but the children of Esau drove them out, and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel hath done unto the land of his inheritance, which the Lord hath given unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered; and we passed over the brook Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the time which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we had passed over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were spent from out the midst of the camp, as the Lord had sworn unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And also the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp; until they were spent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were spent by, dying from the midst of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That the Lord spoke unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou art passing this day by the border of Moab, by Ar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And thou comest nigh opposite the children of Ammon: do not attack them, nor contend with them; for I will not give unto thee of the land of the children of Ammon any inheritance; because unto the children of Lot have I given it for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As the land of Rephaim was it also accounted: Rephaim dwelt therein in times past; and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A people great, and numerous, and tall, as the Anakim; but the Lord destroyed them before them; and they drove them out, and dwelt in their stead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As he hath done to the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from before whom he destroyed the Chorim; and they drove them out and dwelt in their stead, even unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Avvim, who dwelt in open towns, as far as unto Gazzah,the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Rise ye up, set forward, and pass over the brook Arnon; behold I have given into thy hand Sichon the king of Cheshbon, the Emorite, and his land: begin to drive him out, and contend with him in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven; whoever will hear the report of thee, shall tremble, and shall quake because of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sichon, the king of Cheshbon, with words of peace, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Let me pass through thy land: always by the highway will I go along; I will not turn unto the right hand or unto the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Food shalt thou sell me for money, that I may eat; and water for money shalt thou give me, that I may drink: only let me pass through on foot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, have done unto me:) until that I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God giveth us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Sichon, the king of Cheshbon, would not suffer our passing by him; for the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit, and had made obstinate his heart, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as hath happened this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give up Sichon and his land before thee: begin to drive him out, that thou mayest inherit his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Sichon came out against us, he and all his people, to the battle at Yahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Lord our God gave him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And we conquered all his cities at that time, and devoted every inhabited city, and the women, and the little ones; we left none that escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Only the cattle we took as booty unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we had captured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>From Aroer, which is by the bank of the brook of Arnon, and the city that is in the brook, even unto Gilad, there was not one city which was too strong for us; the whole did the Lord our God give up before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon didst thou not come nigh, unto the whole margin of the brook Yabbok, and the cities in the mountain, and unto whatsoever the Lord our God had forbidden us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
