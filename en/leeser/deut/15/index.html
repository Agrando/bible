he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because the release year in honor of the Lord hath been proclaimed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Of a foreigner thou mayest exact payment; but that which is thine with thy brother shall thy hand release.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Although indeed there should be no needy man among thee; for the Lord will greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yet only if thou wilt carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the Lord thy God blesseth thee, as he hath spoken unto thee; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but over thee shall they not rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If there be among thee a needy man, any one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee: thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy needy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But thou shalt open wide thy hand unto him, and thou shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, which his want requireth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Beware that there be not a wicked thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thy eye be thus evil against thy needy brother, so that thou wouldst give him nought; and if he cry concerning thee unto the Lord, it will be sin in thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; for because of this thing the Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all the acquisition of thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the needy will not cease out of the land; therefore do I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open wide thy hand unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If thy brother, the Hebrew, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year shalt thou let him go free from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when thou lettest him go out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flocks, and out of thy threshingfloor, and out of thy winepress; wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee, that shalt thou give unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou shalt remember that thou hast been a bondman in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God hath redeemed thee; therefore do I command thee this thing today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then shalt thou take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be unto thee a servant for ever; and also unto thy maidservant shalt thou do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee, that for double the wages of a hired laborer hath he served thee six years; and the Lord thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the firstborn males that come of thy herds and of thy flocks shalt thou sanctify unto the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstborn of thy bullock, and not shear the firstborn of thy sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Before the Lord thy God shalt thou eat it year by year, in the place which the Lord will choose, thou with thy household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if there be any blemish thereon, if it be lame, or blind, or have any other ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Within thy gates shalt thou eat it, the unclean and the clean together, as the roebuck, and as the hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only the blood thereof shalt thou not eat: upon the ground shalt thou pour it out as water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
