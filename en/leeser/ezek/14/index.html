and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the prophet suffereth himself to be deceived, and he speaketh a word: I the Lord have suffered that prophet to be deceived: and I will stretch out my hand against him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall bear their guilt: as the guilt of the inquirer is, so shall the guilt of the prophet be;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In order that the house of Israel may go no more astray by not following me, and not pollute themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may become unto me a people, and I may be unto them a God, saith the Lord Eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Son of man, if a land should sin against me by trespassing grievously, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break unto it the staff of bread, and send out famine against it, and cut off from it man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if there be these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, in the midst of it: these through their righteousness should save but their own soul; saith the Lord Eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they depopulate it, and it becometh desolate, without any one to pass through because of the beasts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These three men if they were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, should not save either sons or daughters: they only should be saved, but the land should be made desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Or, if I should bring a sword over that land, and say, The sword shall pass through the land, and I cut off from it man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if these three men should be in it: as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, they should not save either sons or daughters, but they alone should be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or, if I should send out the pestilence against that land, and pour out my fury over it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if Noah, Daniel, and Job, should be in the midst of it: as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, they should not save either son or daughter; they through their righteousness should save their own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Although I send my four dreadful means of punishment over Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the wild beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Still, behold, there are left therein some that escape who shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters; behold, they are coming forth unto you, and ye will see their way and their doings; and then will ye be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, yea, concerning all that I have brought upon it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have executed in it, saith the Lord Eternal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
