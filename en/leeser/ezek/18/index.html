he shall not live; all these abominations hath he done, he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And behold, if he beget a son, who seeth all the sins of his father which he hath done, and he considereth, and doth not the like of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Upon the mountains he eateth not, and his eyes he lifteth not up to the idols of the house of Israel, the wife of his neighbor he defileth not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he overreacheth no man, a pledge he withholdeth not, and of a robbery he is never guilty, his bread he giveth to the hungry, and the naked he covereth with a garment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From the poor he withdraweth his hand, interest and increase he taketh not: my ordinances he executeth; in my statutes he walketh:he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His father, because he unjustly withheld wages, was guilty of robbery on his brother, and did that which is not good in the midst of his people,and lo, he died through his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet say ye, Why doth not the son bear part of the iniquity of the father? when the son hath executed justice and righteousness, all my statutes hath he kept, and hath done them: he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The soul that sinneth, she alone shall die; the son shall not help to bear the iniquity of the father and the father shall not help to bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the wicked, when he turneth away from all his sins that he hath committed, and keepeth all my statutes, and executeth justice and righteousness, shall surely live, he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All his transgressions which he hath committed shall not be remembered unto him: through his righteousness which he hath done shall he live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Have I then the least pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Eternal: and not in his turning away from his ways, that he may live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth wrong, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? all his righteousness that he hath done shall not he remembered: through his trespass which he hath committed, and through his sin that he hath done,through them shall he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equitable: hear now, O house of Israel, Is not my way equitable? is it not your ways which are not equitable?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and doth wrong, and dieth therefore: through his wrong which he hath done must he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, when the wicked turneth away from his wickedness which he hath committed, and executeth justice and righteousness: he shall indeed preserve his soul alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because he hath considered, and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed: he shall surely live, he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet say the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equitable: are not my ways equitable, O house of Israel? is it not your ways which are not equitable?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore will I judge you, every one according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal: return ye, and cause others to return from all your transgressions, that iniquity may not become your stumblingblock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Cast away from yourselves all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I have no pleasure in the death of him that deserveth to die, saith the Lord Eternal: therefore convert yourselves, and live.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
