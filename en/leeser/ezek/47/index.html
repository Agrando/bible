Again he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through, the water reaching to the loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he measured again a thousand cubits, it being a stream that I could not wade through; for the water was increased, being water fit to swim in, a stream that could not be waded through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this: Then did he lead me, and caused me to return to the bank of the stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when I returned, behold, there were at the banks of the stream very many trees, on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the eastern district, and go down into the plain, and fall into the sea, the waters being carried forth into the sea, so that the waters shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the doublestream shall come, shall live: and the fish shall be therein in great abundance; for when this water shall have come thither, the waters of the sea shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the stream cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand by it; from Engedi even unto Eneglayim, there shall be places for the spreading out of nets: after their various kinds shall the fish thereof be, like the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But its swamps and its lagoons shall not be healed, for the production of salt are they destined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the stream upon its banks, on this side and on that side, shall grow up all kinds of trees for food, the leaves of which shall not fade, and the fruit of which shall not come to an end, every month shall they bring forth new ripe fruit; because its water is that which issueth out of the sanctuary; and their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for remedies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, This shall be the boundary, whereby ye shall divide out the land unto the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ye shall inherit it, every one like the other, the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, the road to Chethlon, as far as to Zedad;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Chamath, Berothah, Sibrayim, which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Chamath; Chazarhattichon, which is by the boundary of Chavran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the boundary shall be from the sea to Chazarenon, the boundary of Damascus, and the northern part on the north, and the boundary of Chamath. And this is the north side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the east side shall ye measure between Chavran and Damascus on the one side, and between Gilad and the land of Israel on the other side by the Jordan, from the north boundary unto the east sea. And this is the east side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the south side; on the south, from Thamar even to the waters of contention at Kadesh, toward the brook flowing into the Great Sea. And this is the south side on the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the west side shall be the great sea from the southern boundary, as far as straight up to Chamath.
