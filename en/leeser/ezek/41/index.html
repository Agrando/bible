and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then went he inward, and measured the posts of the door, two cubits; and the door was six cubits high; and the breadth of the door, was seven cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, fronting on the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>After this he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every sidechamber was four cubits, all round about the house on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sidechambers were one over another, three and thirty times; and they entered into the wall which was on the house for the sidechambers all round about, that they might be fastened on, but they were not fastened on the wall of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as one wound upward it became continually wider for the sidechambers; for the row of chambers about the house went more and more upward round about the house; therefore was the breadth of the house greater upward: and so they ascended from the lowest chambers to the highest through the middle ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I saw the height of the house all round about: the foundations of the sidechambers were a full rod of six cubits under ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The thickness of the wall, which was for the sidechambers without, was five cubits, as also the space which was left open by the row of the sidechambers that were on the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And between the chambers there was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the doors of the sidechambers were on the open space, one door was in a northern direction, and another door on the south; and the breadth of the place that was left open was five cubits all round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the building that was before the main wing on the west side was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length, ninety cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he measured the house, in length one hundred cubits; and the main wing, and the building, with its walls, in length one hundred cubits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Also the breadth in the front of the house, and of the main wing on the east, was one hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he measured the length of the building on the front side of the main wing which was behind it, and its cornerpillars on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits; and this included the inner temple, and the porches of the court;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The thresholds, and the narrow windows, and the cornerpillars were round about on their three sides: opposite the threshold there was a wainscoting of wood all round about, and so from the ground up to the windows; and the windows were covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On the part above the door, and as far as the inner house, and the outer house, was a wainscoting, and on all the wall round about within and without, by the same measure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it was ornamented with cherubim and palmtrees, a palmtree being between two cherubim; and every cherub had two faces;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So that a human face was toward the palmtree on the one side, and a young lions face toward the palmtree on the other side: it was so made on all the house round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From the ground to the part above the door were the cherubim and the palmtrees made, and so on the wall of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The temple had fourcornered doorposts, and the front of the holy of holies had the same appearance as the appearance of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length was two cubits; and its corners, and its toppiece, and its walls, were of wood: and he spoke unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the temple and the holy of holies had two doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves, two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palmtrees, as they were made upon the walls; and a covering of thick wooden planks was upon the front of the porch without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there were narrow windows and palmtrees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and on the sidechambers of the house, and the covering of thick planks.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
