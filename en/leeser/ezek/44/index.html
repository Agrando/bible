because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore shall it remain locked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As for the prince, being the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord: by the way of the porch of that gate shall he enter, and by the way of the same shall he go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then brought he me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord: and I fell upon my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, direct thy mind, and see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears all that I am speaking with thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and of all its laws; and direct thy mind to the entrance of the house, with every place of egress of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou shalt say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Ye have done enough with all your abominations, O house of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In your having brought the sons of the stranger, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, while you were offering my food, the fat and the blood: so that they broke my covenant because of all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And because ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set those unworthy ones as keepers of my charge in my sanctuary at your own pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, No son of the stranger, uncircumcised in heart, or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of all the sons of the stranger that are in the midst of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But as respecteth the Levites that were gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray away from me, after their idols, they shall surely bear their iniquity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they shall be in my sanctuary, servants, appointed to watch at the gates of the house, and to be servants for the house: these are they that shall slay the burntofferings and the sacrifices for the people, and they shall stand before them to do the service for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because that they used to serve them before their idols, and have been unto the house of Israel as a stumblingblock of iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Eternal, and they shall bear their iniquity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they shall not come near unto me, to officiate as priests unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the most holy things; but they shall bear their shame, yea, for their abominations which they have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will appoint them to be keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me,these are they that shall come near unto me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Eternal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are they that shall enter into my sanctuary, and these shall come near to my table, to minister unto me; and they shall keep my charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall come to pass, that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall clothe themselves with linen garments; and there shall no wool come upon them, when they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Linen bonnets shall be upon their heads, and linen breeches shall be upon their loins: they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they go forth into the outer court, into the outer court to the people: then shall they put off their garments wherein they have ministered, and they shall lay them down in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, and they shall not mingle among the people with their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And their heads shall they not shave close, nor suffer their hair to grow long: they shall only crop the hair of their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And wine shall none of the priests drink when they enter into the inner court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And a widow, or one that is divorced from her husband shall they not take to themselves as wives; but only virgins of the seed of the house of Israel; but whatever widow it may be, the common priests may take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And my people shall they teach the difference between the holy and profane, and that between the unclean and the clean shall they make known unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in a controversy shall they stand up to judge, according to my ordinances shall they decide it: and my laws and my statutes at all my festivals shall they observe, and my sabbaths shall they sanctify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And to a dead person shall they not come to defile themselves; but on father, or on mother, or on son, or on daughter, on brother, or on sister that hath had no husband, may they defile themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after he is become clean,they shall reckon unto him seven days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then shall he on the day that he cometh into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, offer his sinoffering, saith the Lord Eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall be unto them as an inheritance, I am their inheritance: and any possession shall you not give them in Israel, I am their possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The meatoffering, and the sinoffering, and the trespassofferingthese shall they eat; and every devoted thing in Israel shall belong to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the first of all kinds of firstfruits of all, and every kind of heaveoffering of every thing of all your heaveofferings, shall belong to the priests; and the first of your dough shall you give to the priest, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Any thing that hath died of itself, or that is torn, whether it be fowl or beast, shall the priests not eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
