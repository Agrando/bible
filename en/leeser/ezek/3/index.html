And I ate it; and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For not to a people of an obscure speech and of a difficult tongue art thou sent, but to the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not to many people of an obscure speech and of a difficult tongue, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would truly have hearkened unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me; for all the house of Israel have a bold forehead, and a hard heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their face, and thy forehead strong against their forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: thou shalt not fear them, nor shalt thou be dismayed at their presence, though they be a rebellious family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I will speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear them with thy ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And go, get thee to those in exile, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal: whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then a spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I heard also the sound of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the sound of the wheels at the same time with them, and the sound of a great rushing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So a spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I walked in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the inspiration of the Lord was strong upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then came I to the exiles at Telabib, who dwelt by the river Kebar, and I remained where they dwelt, and I remained there in a state of confusion among them seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, That the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou dost not give him warning, and speakest not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life: the same wicked man shall die through his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But thou,if thou hast warned the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way: he shall indeed die in his iniquity; but thou hast surely delivered thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, When a righteous man do turn from his righteousness, and do what is wrong: then will I lay a stumblingblock before him, so that he shall die; yet if thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his acts of righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require from thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if thou hast truly warned him,the righteous, that the righteous should not sin, and he doth not sin: he shall surely live, because he attended to the warning, and thou hast surely delivered thy own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the inspiration of the Lord came there over me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there will I speak with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I arose, and went forth into the valley; and, behold, there was the glory of the Lord standing, like that glory which I had seen by the river Kebar: and I fell down on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then entered a spirit into me, and placed me upright on my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself up within thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thou, O son of man, behold, they put ropes upon thee, and bind thee with them, that thou canst not go out among them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will let thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not become to them a man who reproveth; for they are a rebellious family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forebear; for they are a rebellious family.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
