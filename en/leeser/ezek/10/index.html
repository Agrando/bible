And he went in before my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house, when the man went in: and the cloud filled the inner court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the glory of the Lord rose upward from the cherub, toward the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lords glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside the wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and lifted it up, and placed it into the hands of the one clothed in linen; who took it, and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there became visible on the cherubim the form of a mans hand beneath their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I saw, and, behold, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by the one cherub, and another wheel by the other cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was like the glitter of a chrysolite stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as for their appearances, the whole four had one likeness, as if a wheel were in the midst of another wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In their going, they went toward their four sides, they turned not round in their going; but to the place whither the head was turned they followed it, they turned not round in their going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their whole body, and their back, and their hands, and their wings, as also the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that belonged to all four of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the wheels, they were called Galgal before my ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And every one had four faces: the one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face was the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the cherubim lifted themselves up.
