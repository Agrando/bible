and wherefore have I not found favor in thy eyes, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Was it I who have conceived all this people? or was it I who have begotten them? that thou shouldst say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou hast sworn unto their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whence shall I obtain flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep around me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able by myself alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if thou wilt thus deal with me, then slay me, I pray thee, at once, if I have found favor in thy eyes: that I may not see my wretchedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and its officers; and take them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall stand there with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and speak with thee there: and I will take some of the spirit which is upon thee, and I will put it upon them; and they shall bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou shalt not bear it by thyself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto the people shalt thou say, Hold yourselves ready against tomorrow, that ye may eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was better with us in Egypt: thus will the Lord give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Not one day shall ye eat, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But up to a full month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it become loathsome unto you; because that ye have despised the Lord who is in the midst of you, and ye have wept before him, saying, Why did we come forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said, Six hundred thousand men on foot is the people, in the midst of whom I am; and yet thou hast said, Flesh will I give them, that they may eat a whole month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, that they may suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, that they may suffice for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Should the Lords hand be too short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses went out, and spoke to the people the words of the Lord; and he assembled seventy men from the elders of the people, and placed them round about the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Lord came down in a cloud and spoke unto him; and he took some of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men, the elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did not so any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of those that were written down, but they had not gone out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there ran a young man, and told to Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses from his youth, answered and said, My Lord Moses, forbid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said unto him, Art thou zealous for my sake? And oh that one might render all the people of the Lord prophets, that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses retired back into thy camp, he with the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And a wind went forth from the Lord, and drove up quails from the sea, and scattered them over the camp, about a days journey on this side, and about a days journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits high over the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people arose all that day, and all that night, and all the following day, and they gathered the quails; he that had taken the least, had gathered ten chomers: and they spread them out for themselves round about the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The flesh was yet between their teeth, it was not yet chewed: when the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote among the people a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah; because there they buried the people that had lustfully craved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Chazeroth; and they remained at Chazeroth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
