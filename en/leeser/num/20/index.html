it is no place for sowing, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; and water even there is none to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take the staff, and gather the assembly together, thou, with Aaron thy brother, and ye shall speak unto the rock before their eyes, that it shall give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth for them water out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses took the staff from before the Lord, as he had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels! shall we out of this rock bring forth water for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses lifted up his hand, and he smote the rock with his staff twice: and there came out much water, and the congregation drank, together with their cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye have not confided in me, to sanctify me before the eyes of the children of Israel: therefore shall ye not bring this congregation into the land which I have given to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These are the waters of Meribah; where the children of Israel quarreled with the Lord, and through which he was sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus hath said thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the hardship that hath befallen us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt many days; and the Egyptians did evil to us, and to our fathers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we cried unto the Lord, and he heard our voice, and he sent a messenger, and caused us to go forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city at the outmost end of thy border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through field, or through vineyard, and we will not drink the water of the wells: by the kingÂ’s highway will we go, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through my land, lest I come against thee with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the highway: and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I pay its value; I will do thee no injury, only on foot will I pass through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Thou shalt not pass through; and Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as Edom thus refused to permit Israel to pass through his border, Israel turned away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they set forward from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron at mount Hor, by the boundary of the land of Edom, as followeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my order at the waters of Meribah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Take Aaron and Elazar, his son, and cause them to go up unto mount Hor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And cause Aaron to take off his garments, and clothe therewith Elazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered in, and he shall die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses did as the Lord had commanded; and they went up to mount Hor before the eyes of all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses caused Aaron to take off his garments, and he clothed therewith Elazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount; and Moses and Elazar then came down from the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was departed, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
