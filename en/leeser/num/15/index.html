and that person shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because the word of the Lord hath he despised, and his commandment hath he broken; that person shall be cut off, his iniquity is upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbathday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they that found him gathering sticks brought him for judgment unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they put him in ward; because it had not been declared what should be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the congregation brought him forth to without the camp, and they stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Lord said unto Moses, as followeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say to them, that they shall make themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put upon the fringe of the corner a thread of blue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye seek not after the inclination of your own heart and the delight of your eyes, in pursuit of which ye have been led astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>In order that ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
