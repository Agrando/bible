because the consecration of his God is upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the days of his abstinence is he holy unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if some one die very suddenly by him, and he thus defile his consecrated head: then shall he shave his head on the day of his being cleansed, on the seventh day shall he shave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the eighth day shall he bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priest shall prepare the one for a sinoffering, and the other for a burntoffering, and make an atonement for him, because he hath sinned through the dead; and he shall hallow his head on that same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he shall consecrate unto the Lord again the days of his abstinence, and he shall bring a sheep of the first year for a trespassoffering; but the prior days shall not be counted, because his consecration hath been defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this is the law of the Nazarite: On the day when the days of his abstinence are completed, shall he present himself at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he shall bring his offering unto the Lord, one male sheep of the first year without blemish for a burntoffering, and one ewe of the first year without blemish for a sinoffering, and one ram without blemish for a peaceoffering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil;

and the priest shall prepare his meatoffering and his drinkoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Nazarite shall shave at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation his consecrated head; and he shall take the hair of his consecrated head, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peaceoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram when it is cooked, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after he hath shaved his consecrated head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the priest shall make with them a waving before the Lord; it is a holy gift for the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the shoulder that was lifted up: and after that may the Nazarite drink wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed; his offering unto the Lord for his abstinence, besides that which he may be able to give: according to his vow which he may vow, so must he do in addition to what is required by the law of his abstinence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, Thus shall ye bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Lord bless thee, and preserve thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Lord make his face shine unto thee, and be gracious to thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The Lord lift up his countenance unto thee, and give thee peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel: and I will bless them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
