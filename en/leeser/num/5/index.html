that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the children of Israel did so, and they sent them out to without the camp: as the Lord had spoken unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, If any man or woman commit any sin against a fellowman, thereby doing a trespass against the Lord, and this person thus become guilty:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then shall they confess their sin which they have committed; and he shall make restitution for his trespass with the principal thereof, and its fifth part shall he add thereto, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution could be made for the trespass, then shall the trespass which is restored unto the Lord, belong to the priest; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every mans hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth to the priest, shall belong to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If the wife of any man go aside, and commit a trespass against him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hidden from the eyes of her husband, because she hath been secretly defiled; and there be no witness against her, and she have not been detected and in the fact;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the spirit of jealousy come over him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she have been defiled; or the spirit of jealousy come over him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she have not been defiled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barleymeal; he shall not pour any oil upon it, nor put any frankincense thereupon; for it is a meatoffering of jealousy, a meatoffering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest shall bring her near, and place her before the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel;

and in the hand of the priest shall be the bitter waters that bring the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and he shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness behind thy husband: then be thou free from these bitter waters that bring the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if thou hast gone aside behind thy husband, and if thou hast been defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of imprecation, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The Lord then make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the Lord doth cause thy thigh to fall away, and thy belly to swell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And these waters that bring the curse shall go into thy bowels, to cause the belly to swell, and the thigh to fall away;

and the woman shall become a curse among her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if the woman have not been defiled, but be clean: then shall she remain unharmed, and she shall conceive seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This is the law of jealousies, when a woman goeth aside behind her husband, and hath been defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh over him, and he be jealous of his wife; and he shall place the woman before the Lord, and the priest shall do unto her altogether according to this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the man shall be guiltless from iniquity; but this woman shall bear her iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
