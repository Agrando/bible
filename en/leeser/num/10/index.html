and they shall serve thee for the calling of the congregation, and for the setting forward of the camps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when they shall blow with both, all the congregation shall assemble themselves unto thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if they blow with but one, then shall assemble themselves unto thee the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when ye blow an alarm, then shall set forward the camps that encamp on the east side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when ye blow an alarm the second time, then shall set forward the camps that encamp on the south side: an alarm shall they blow for their setting forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But at the assembling of the assembly, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;
