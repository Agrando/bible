and Moab was horrified because of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this assemblage devour all that is round about us, as the ox devoureth the grass of the field; and Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sent messengers unto Bilam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river, in the land of the children of his people, to have him called; saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, it covereth the surface of the earth, and it is abiding opposite to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now do but come, curse me this people; for it is too mighty for me; peradventure I may be able to smite it, that I may drive it out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Bilam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said unto them, Remain you here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the Lord may speak unto me; and the princes of Moab abode with Bilam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God came unto Bilam, and said, Who are these men with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Bilam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, there is the people that is come out of Egypt, and covereth the face of the earth: now come, denounce it for me; peradventure I shall be able to fight against it, and drive it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said unto Bilam, Thou shalt not go with them: thou shalt not curse the people; for it is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Bilam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Go back to your land; for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Bilam refuseth to come with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Balak sent yet again princes, more in number, and more honorable than those.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came to Bilam, and said to him, Thus hath said Balak the son of Zippor, Do not suffer thyself, I pray thee, to be prevented from coming unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will honor thee greatly, and whatsoever thou mayest say unto me will I do: and only come, I pray thee, denounce me this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bilam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not transgress the order of the Lord my God, to do a small or a great thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the Lord will farther speak with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God came unto Bilam at night, and said unto him, If to call thee the men have come, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Bilam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the anger of God was kindled, because he went; and an angel of the Lord placed himself in the way to be a hindrance to him; and he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Bilam smote the ass, to make her turn into the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the angel of the Lord stepped into a path between the vineyards, with a wall on this side, and a wall on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she forced herself against the wall, and pressed Bilams foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the angel of the Lord went yet farther, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Bilam: whereupon Bilams anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Bilam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Bilam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: had I but a sword in my hand, I would assuredly have now killed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the ass said unto Bilam, Am not I thy ass, upon which thou hast ridden from thy commencement unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Lord opened the eyes of Bilam, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head and prostrated himself on his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thy ass these three times? behold, I went out to be a hindrance; because the journey which is odious to me was too quickly begun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times; if she had not turned aside from me, I would surely now not only have slain thee, but saved her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Bilam said unto the angel of the Lord, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou wast standing against me in the way; but now, if it be evil in thy eyes, I will return home again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel of the Lord said unto Bilam, Go with the men; however, only the word which I will speak unto thee, that shalt thou speak: and Bilam went with the princes of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when Balak heard that Bilam was come, he went out to meet him unto IrMoab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is at the outmost end of the boundary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Balak said unto Bilam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to have thee called? wherefore camest thou not unto me? in truth, am I not able to honor thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Bilam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power whatever to speak the least? the word that God may put in my mouth, that alone must I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Bilam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiryathchuzoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Balak slew oxen and sheep, and sent to Bilam and to the princes that were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Bilam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, and he saw thence a portion of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
