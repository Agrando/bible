and he shall sprinkle in the direction of the front of the tabernacle of the congregation of her blood seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And some one shall burn the cow before his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall take cedarwood, and hyssop, and a scarlet string, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the cow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward may he come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water; and he shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of sprinkling: it is a purificationoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he that gathereth up the ashes of the cow shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that toucheth the dead body of any human person shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Such a one shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day, when he shall be clean;

and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: Every one that cometh into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And every open vessel, on which there is not a closely fitting cover, is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And whosoever toucheth in the open field one that hath been slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they shall take for the unclean person some of the ashes of the burnt purificationoffering, and they shall put thereupon running water in a vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that have been there, and upon him that hath touched the bone, or the one slain, or the dead, or the grave:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day;
