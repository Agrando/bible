and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined with thee, and minister unto thee; while thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tabernacle of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar shall they not come near, that they may not die, either they or you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, respecting all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be not any more wrath upon the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel; unto you are they given as a gift for the Lord, to perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood concerning every matter of the altar, and for that within the vail, where ye shall serve: as a service of gift do I give you your priesthood; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, And I, behold, I give thee the charge of my heaveofferings; of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel, unto thee have I given them as an official portion, and to thy sons, as a fixed right for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This shall belong to thee of the most holy things, from the fireofferings: every oblation of theirs, namely, every meatoffering of theirs, and every sinoffering of theirs, and every, trespassoffering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall, as most holy things, belong to thee and to thy sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In a most holy place shalt thou eat it: every male shall eat it; holy shall it be unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this shall be thine, as the heaveoffering of their gift, of all the waveofferings of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a fixed portion for ever: every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the best of oil, and all the best of wine, and of corn, the firstfruits thereof which they shall offer unto the Lord, to thee have I given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The first ripe fruit of whatsoever is in their land, which they may bring unto the Lord, shall be thine: every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whatever openeth the womb of all flesh, which they bring unto the Lord, be it of men or of cattle, shall be thine: nevertheless thou shalt redeem the firstborn of man, and the firstling of the unclean cattle shalt thou redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to the usual estimation of five shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: their blood shalt thou sprinkle upon the altar, and their fat shalt thou burn as a fireoffering, for a sweet savor unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And their flesh shall be thine: as the breast that is waved and as the right shoulder shall it be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the heaveofferings of the holy things, which the children of Israel set apart unto the Lord, I have given to thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a fixed portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord for thee and for thy seed with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord said unto Aaron, In their land shalt thou have no inheritance, and any portion shalt thou not have among them: I am thy portion and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given every tithe in Israel, for an inheritance, in lieu of their service which they render, the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the children of Israel shall not henceforth come nigh unto the tabernacle of the congregation, to bear sin, to die thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they of the tribe of Levi themselves shall perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: a statute for ever shall it be throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel shall they not possess any inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heaveoffering unto the Lord, have I given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore have I said unto them, Among the children of Israel shall they obtain no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And unto the Levites shalt thou speak, and say unto them, When ye take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance: then shall ye separate therefrom a heaveoffering of the Lord, the tenth part of the tithe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And your heaveoffering shall be reckoned unto you, like the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus shall ye also offer a heaveoffering unto the Lord from all your tithes, which ye may receive from the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the heaveoffering of the Lord to Aaron the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From all your gifts shall ye set apart every heaveoffering of the Lord, from every best part thereof, its hallowed portion therefrom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou shalt say unto them, When ye have separated the best thereof from it: then shall the remainder be counted unto the Levites as the produce of the threshingfloor, and as the produce of the winepress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye may eat it in every place, ye and your households; for it is your reward in lieu of your service at the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And ye shall not bear any sin by reason of it, when ye have separated its best part from it: and the holy things of the children of Israel shall ye not profane, lest ye die.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
