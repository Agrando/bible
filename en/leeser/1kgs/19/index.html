and he said, It is enough, now, O Lord, take away my soul; for I am not better than my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he laid himself down and slept under a certain broombush, and, behold then, an angel was touching him, and said unto him, Arise, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he looked about, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on coals, and a cruise of water; and he ate and drank, and laid himself down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel of the Lord came again, the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise, eat; because the journey is yet far for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he arose, and ate and drank; and he went on the strength of that eating forty days and forty nights unto the mount of God, Horeb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he came there unto a cave, and remained there over night: and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and said unto him, What dost thou here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thy altars have they thrown down, and thy prophets have they slain with the sword: and I am left by myself alone, and they have sought my life, to take it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord: and, behold, the Lord passed by, and a wind, great and strong, rending the mountains, and breaking in pieces the rocks went before the Lord; but not in the wind was the Lord: and after the wind was an earthquake: but not in the earthquake was the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after the earthquake was a fire; but not in the fire was the Lord; and after the fire was the sound of a soft whisper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Elijah heard it, that he concealed his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave: and, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What dost thou here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thy altars have they thrown down, and thy prophets have they slain with the sword: and I am left by myself alone, and they have sought my life, to take it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and go, anoint Chazael to be king over Syria;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmecholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Chazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will leave in Israel seven thousand, all the knees which have not been bent unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing; twelve yoke of oxen were before him, and he was with the twelfth: and Elijah passed up to him, and cast his mantle toward him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss but my father and my mother, and I will then follow thee: and he said unto him, Go, return; for what have I done to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and with the instruments of the oxen he boiled the flesh for them, and he gave it unto the people, and they did eat; and then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
