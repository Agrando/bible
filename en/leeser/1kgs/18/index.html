And the people answered him not a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Elijah said unto the people, I have been left a prophet of the Lord by myself alone; but the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore let there be given unto us two bullocks; and let them choose for themselves the one bullock, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire to it: and I will prepare the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And do ye call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and it shall be that the God who answereth by fire, he shall be the true God. And all the people answered and said, The proposal is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you for yourselves the one bullock, and prepare it first; for ye are the many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they took the bullock which he had given to them, and they prepared it; and they called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us; but there was no voice, nor any answer: and they danced about the altar which had been made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked at them, and said, Call with a loud voice; for he is a god; either he is holding council, or he is busy in some pursuit, or he is on a journey; or peradventure he sleepeth, and may thus awaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they called with a loud voice and cut themselves after their custom with knives and spears, till the blood gushed out over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when midday was past, that they practised their follies until near the time of the offering of the eveningsacrifice; but there was neither voice, nor any answer, nor any perceptible sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me: and all the people came near unto him; and he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been torn down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord was come, saying, Israel shall be thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he built of the stones an altar in the name of the Lord; and he made a trench as great as would contain two seahs of seed round about the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he put in order the wood, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid them on the wood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said. Fill four jars with water; and they had to pour it on the burntoffering, and on the wood: and he said, Do it the second time: and they did it the second time: and he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the water ran round about the altar; and the trench also he filled with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the eveningsacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Lord, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, this day let it be known that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that at thy word I have done all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Answer me, O Lord, answer me, and let all this people know that thou, O Lord, art the true God, and thou wilt then have turned their heart back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And there fell a fire of the Lord, and consumed the burntoffering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust; and the water also that was in the trench did it lick up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when all the people saw this, they fell on their faces; and they said, the Lordhe is the God; the Lordhe is the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Elijah said unto them, Seize the prophets of Baal; not one of them must escape; and they seized them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slaughtered them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Elijah said unto Achab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So Achab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down toward the earth, and put his face between his knees;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he said to his servant, Go up, I pray thee, look in the direction of the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, Not the least is visible. And he said, Go again, seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there is a little cloud like a mans hand arising out of the sea. And he said, Go up, say unto Achab, Harness up thy chariot, and come down, that the rain may not detain thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heavens were blackened with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Achab rode, and went to Yizreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the inspiration of the Lord came over Elijah, and he girded up his loins; and he ran before Achab up to the entrance of Yizreel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
