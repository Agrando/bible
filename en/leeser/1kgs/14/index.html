But Achiyahu was not able to see; for his eyes were set by reason of his high age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord had said unto Achiyahu, Behold the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire a word of thee about her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou speak unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign to be another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it happened, when Achiyahu heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why is this, that thou feignest to be another? but I am sent to thee with a hard message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, say to Jeroboam, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from the midst of the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it unto thee; whereas thou hast not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed after me with all his heart, to do only what is right in my eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou hast done more evil than all that were before thee; and thou art gone and hast made unto thyself other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and me hast thou cast behind thy back:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, behold, will I bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, also the guarded and fortified in Israel; and I will sweep out after the house of Jeroboam as one sweepeth away the dung till there be nothing left of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the heavens eat; for the Lord hath spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But thou, arise now, go to thy own house: when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for this one alone shall come of Jeroboams family to the grave; because there hath been found in him some good thing toward the Lord the God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord will raise up unto himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam what is here this day, and what will be after this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord will smite Israel, as the reed is shaken in the water, and he will pull up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them on the other side of the river; because they have made their groves, provoking the Lord to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will give Israel up for the sake of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who induced Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jeroboams wife arose, and departed, and came to Thirzah; and as she came to the threshold of the door, the lad died:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by the hand of his servant Achiyahu the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son became king in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.

And his mothers name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abiyam his son became king in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
