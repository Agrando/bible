And the messengers went away, and brought him word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Benhadad then sent unto him, and said, May the gods do so unto me, and continue to do so, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that are in my train.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king of Israel answered and said, Speak, Let him that girdeth on the armor not boast himself as he that putteth it off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, when he heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Get ready for the attack. And they got ready for the attack against the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, behold, there approached a certain prophet unto Achab the king of Israel, and said, Thus hath said the Lord, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Achab said, By whom? And he said, Thus hath said the Lord, By means of the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then said he, Who shall order the battle? And he said, Thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He then numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirtytwo: and after them he numbered all the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they went out at midday; while Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out at first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, Some men are come out of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, If they be come out for peace, catch them alive; and if they be come out for war, alive must ye catch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So these, the young men of the princes of the provinces, came out of the city, with the army which followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and inflicted on the Syrians a great defeat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the prophet approached unto the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou hast to do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Gods of the mountains are their gods; therefore they prevailed over us; but let us fight against them in the plain, and see whether we shall not prevail over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But do this thing, Remove the kings, every one from his place, and appoint governors in their rooms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thou, number for thyself an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and see whether we shall prevail over them. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to the war with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the children of Israel were numbered, and provisioned, and went out against them: and the children of Israel encamped opposite to them like two little flocks of goats; but the Syrians filled the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there approached the man of God, and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus hath said the Lord, Forasmuch as the Syrians have said, "A God of the hills is the Lord, but he is not God of the valleys": will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they encamped one opposite the other for seven days. And it happened, that on the seventh day the battle took place: and the children of Israel smote the Syrians a hundred thousand men on foot in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But those that were left fled to Aphek, into the city; but the citywall fell upon the twenty and seven thousand men that had been left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an innermost chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kindly kings; let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he may save thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad hath said, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the men took it for a good sign, and hastened and caught at his word, whether it was his earnest; and they said, Thy brother Benhadad! But he said, Go ye, bring him. Then came Benhadad forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, will I restore; and thou canst lay out for thyself streets in Damascus, as my father laid out in Samaria. "And I for my part will send thee away with this covenant." So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his companion, By the word of the Lord, smite me, I pray thee. But the man refused to smite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said he unto him, Forasmuch as thou hast not obeyed the voice of the Lord, behold, when thou goest away from me, a lion shall slay thee. And he went away from him, when a lion found him, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he met with another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the prophet then went, and placed himself before the king on the way, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king, and said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought unto me a man, and said, Guard this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be forfeit for his life, or else thou shalt weigh me down a talent of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But it happened as thy servant was Busy here and there, that he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So is thy sentence: thou thyself hast decided it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he hastened, and removed the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him that he was one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had caught in my net, therefore shall thy life be the forfeit for his life, and thy people for his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the king of Israel went to his house lowspirited and displeased, and he came to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
