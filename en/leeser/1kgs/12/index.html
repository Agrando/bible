And the people went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then consulted king Rehoboam with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I should give an answer to this people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they spoke unto him, saying, If thou wilt this day be a servant unto this people, and wilt serve them, and be attentive to them, and speak to them good words; then will they be servants unto thee for all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, those who stood before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto them, What do you counsel how we should give an answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make lighter the yoke which thy father did put upon us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then spoke unto him the young men that were grown up with him, saying, Thus must thou say unto this people that have spoken unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but do thou make it lighter unto us: thus must thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my fathers loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, if my father hath burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will even add to your yoke; if my father hath chastised you with whips, then will I chastise you with scorpionthorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When now Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Return to me on the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The king answered the people harshly, and forsook the old mens counsel that they had advised him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will even add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpionthorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was so brought about from the Lord, in order that he might fulfill his word, which the Lord had spoken by means of Achiyah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people gave the king an answer saying, What portion have we in David? nor have we an inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel: now see to thy own house, David. So did Israel go away unto their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, over them did Rehoboam reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then sent king Rehoboam Adoram, who was over the tribute; but all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed with all his might to get up into his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So did Israel rebel against the house of David unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, save the tribe of Judah alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the word of God came unto Shemayah the man of God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Say unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus hath said the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight with your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for from me hath this thing been brought about. And they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and returned to go home, according to the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jeroboam built Shechem in the mountain of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from there and built Penuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now may the kingdom return to the house of David:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If this people go up to prepare sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then may the heart of this people turn again unto their Lord, even unto Rehoboam the king of Judah, and they might kill me, and return to Rehoboam the king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Whereupon the king took counsel, and he made two calves of gold, and said unto the people, You have been long enough going up to Jerusalem: behold, here are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he placed the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this thing became a sin; and the people went before the one, as far as Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he made a house of the highplaces, and made priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jeroboam made a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar; so did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he stationed at Bethel the priests of the highplaces whom he had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had falsely devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast unto the children of Israel, and he went up to the altar, to burn incense.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
