And his hand, which he had put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The altar also was rent, and the ashes were spilled about from the altar, according to the token which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king commenced and said unto the man of God, Offer but entreaty before the Lord thy God, and pray in behalf of me, that my hand may return to me again. And the man of God offered his entreaty before the Lord, and the kings hand returned to him again, and became as it was before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king spoke unto the man of God, Come home with me, and take some refreshment, and I will give thee a present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the man of God said unto the king, If thou wert to give me the half of thy house, I would not go in with thee, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For so was it charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Thou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he went by another way, and returned not by the way on which he was come to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there dwelt a certain old prophet in Bethel; and his son came and told him all the deed that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words also which he had spoken unto the king, these too they told to their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their father spoke unto them, What way did he go? His sons however had seen what way had gone the man of God, who had come from Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass, and he rode away thereon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under the oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said he unto him, Come with me home, and eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I cannot return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For a command came to me by the word of the Lord, Thou shalt not eat bread nor drink water there; thou shalt not return to go by the way also by which thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said unto him, I also am a prophet like thee; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee unto thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he returned with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, as they were sitting at the table, That the word of the Lord came unto the prophet who had brought him back;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he called unto the man of God that was come from Judah, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the order of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God had commanded thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But didst return, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of which he had spoken to thee, Thou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water: thy dead body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he was gone, a lion met him on the way, and slew him; and his corpse remained cast down on the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the corpse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, behold, men passed by, and saw the corpse cast down on the way, and the lion standing by the corpse; and they came and spoke of it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the prophet that had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, It is the man of God who was disobedient unto the order of the Lord; wherefore the Lord hath given him up unto the lion, who hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went and found his corpse cast down on the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse: the lion had not eaten the corpse, nor torn the ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to lament for, and to bury him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he laid his corpse in his own sepulchre; and they lamented over him, "Alas, my brother!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; beside his bones lay ye my bones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the thing which he called out by the word of the Lord against the altar which is in Bethel, and against all the houses of the highplaces which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After this event Jeroboam returned not from his evil way; but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the highplaces: whosoever desired it, he consecrated, that he might become one of the priests of the highplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he became through this thing the cause of sin unto the house of Jeroboam, and to cause that it was blotted out, and destroyed from off the face of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
