Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou didst strike through with his own spears the chiefs of his villages, who rushed out furiously to scatter me; who rejoiced greatly as though they were to devour the poor in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But thou didst pass along over the sea with thy horses, over the piled up billows of great waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I heard it, and my inmost parts trembled; at the report my lips quivered; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place, that I should rest till the day of distress, till the withdrawing of the people that will invade us with its troops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the figtree doth not bud, and no fruit is on the vines; the productiveness of the olive deceiveth, and the fields yield no food; from the fold the flocks are cut off, and there are no herds in the stalls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will exult in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord Eternal is my strength, and he maketh my feet fleet as those of the hinds, and he will cause me to tread upon my high places.
