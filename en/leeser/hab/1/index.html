O Lord, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O Protector, thou hast appointed them to correct nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou, who art too pure of eyes to behold evil, and canst not look on trouble, wherefore wilt thou look upon those that deal treacherously, be silent when the wicked swalloweth up him that is more righteous than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And why makest thou men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All of them he bringeth up with the angle, he draggeth them up in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because through them is his portion fat, and his food marrowy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall he therefore always empty his net, and continually slay nations without sparing?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
