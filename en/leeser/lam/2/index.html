The joy for all the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>All thy enemies open wide their mouth against thee; they hiss and gnash their teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up: ah, truly this is the day that we hoped for; we have found, we have seen it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Lord hath done what he had resolved; he hath accomplished his word which he had ordained already in the days of old; he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied; and he hath caused to rejoice over thee thy enemy, he hath raised on high the horn of thy adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their heart crieth unto the Lord, O thou wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a stream day and night; allow thyself no rest; let not the apple of thy eye be still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Arise, complain aloud in the night, in the beginning of the watches; pour out like water thy heart before the face of the Lord: lift up toward him thy hands because of the life of thy babes, that faint away for hunger at the corner of all the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>See, O Lord, and behold! to whom hast thou ever done the like? Shall women, then, eat their own fruit, the babes they have tenderly nursed? or shall there be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord the priest and the prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There lie down on the ground in the streets the lad and the ancient: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain on the day of thy anger; thou hast slaughtered, thou hast not pitied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou hast called, as it were on a festive day, my evil neighbors from round about; and there was not on the day of the Lords anger one that escaped or remained: those that I had tenderly nursed and reared up my enemy brought to their end.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
