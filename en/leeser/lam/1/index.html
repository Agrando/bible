Behold, O Lord, my affliction; for the enemy hath become great above me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His hand hath the adversary spread out over all her magnificent things; for she hath seen nations entering into her sanctuary, of whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>all her people sigh, they are seeking bread; they have given their precious things for food to refresh their soul: see, O Lord, and look, how I have been brought low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"I adjure you, all that pass this way, behold, and see if there be any pain like unto my pain, which hath been inflicted on me, wherewith the Lord hath aggrieved me on the day of his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From on high hath he sent a fire into my bones, and breaketh them one by one: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath caused me to return backward; he hath made me desolate, sick all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Bound fast is the yoke of my transgressions by his hand, they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to stumble: the Lord hath given me up into the hands of those against whom I am not able to rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me; he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: a winepress hath the Lord trodden over the virgin, the daughter of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For these things do I weep; my eye, my eye runneth down with water; because far from me is the comforter that should refresh my soul: my children are in misery, because the enemy hath prevailed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, without one to comfort her; the Lord hath given a charge concerning Jacob to all his adversaries round about him: Jerusalem is become as an unclean woman among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Righteous is the Lord; for against his orders have I rebelled: oh do hear, all ye people, and see my pain! my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders perished in the city; for they sought food for themselves to refresh their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>See, O Lord! how I am in distress; my bowels are heated; my heart is turned round within me; because I have grievously rebelled: abroad bereaveth the sword, at home, like the pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They hear how greatly I sigh, yet there is none to comfort me; all my enemies have heard of my misfortune, they are glad that thou hast done it: oh that thou wouldst bring the day which thou hast proclaimed against me, that they may become like me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let all their wickedness come before thee, and do unto them as thou hast done unto me because of all my transgressions; for many are my sighs, and my heart is sick."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
