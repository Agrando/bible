And let men bless thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou indeed art the Eternal One alone: It is thou that hast made the heavens with all their host, the earth, and all that is upon her, the seas, and all that is in them, and thou givest life to them all; and the host of the heavens bow down before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou art indeed the Lord the true God, who didst choose Abram, and bring him forth out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and change his name to Abraham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee: and thou madest with him the covenant to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Emorites, and the Perizittes, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashiteto give it to his seed: and thou hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and their cry didst thou hear by the Red Sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou didst display signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they had dealt presumptuously against them; and thou didst thus make thyself a name, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the sea didst thou divide before them, so that they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land; and their pursuers didst thou throw into the deeps, like a stone in mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by a pillar of cloud didst thou lead them in the day, and by a pillar of fire in the night, to give light unto them on the way whereon they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also on mount Sinai camest thou down, and spokest with them from heaven; and thou gavest them upright ordinances, and truthful laws, good statutes and commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thy holy sabbath madest thou known unto them, and commandments, statutes, and a law didst thou enjoin on them, by the hand of Moses thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And bread from heaven didst thou give them for their hunger, and water out of the rock broughtest thou forth for them for their thirst; and thou didst order them to go in to take possession of the land concerning which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they and our fathers acted presumptuously, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they refused to obey, and remembered not thy marvelous deeds which thou hadst done with them; but they hardened their neck, and spoke of appointing a chief to return to their bondage, in their rebellion; but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, longsuffering, and abundant in kindness, and forsookest them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, although they had made for themselves a molten calf, and said, This is thy god that hath brought thee up out of Egypt, and had practised great provocations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet in thy abundant mercies didst thou not forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them on the way; nor the pillar of fire by night, to give them light on the way whereon they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And thy good spirit thou gavest to make them intelligent, and thy manna thou withheldest not from their mouth, and water thou gavest them for their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And forty years didst thou provide for them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out; and their feet swelled not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou gavest them also kingdoms and nations, which thou didst divide into various corners: and they took possession of the land of Sichon, even the land of the king of Cheshbon, and the land of Og the king of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And their children didst thou multiply like the stars of heaven, and then broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst ordered their fathers to enter in to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the children entered in and took possession of the land; and thou didst humble before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them up into their hands, with their kings, and the nations of the land, that they might do with them according to their pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they captured fortified cities, and a fat soil; and they took possession of houses full of all good things, hewnout wells, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance; and they ate, and were satisfied, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then became they disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and they slew thy prophets who had warned them to bring them back unto thee, and they practised great provocations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thereupon thou gavest them up into the hand of their adversaries, who oppressed them: and in the time of their distress they used to cry unto thee, and thou ever heardest them from heaven; and according to thy abundant mercies thou wast wont to give them helpers, who helped them out of the hand of their adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when once more they had rest, they did again evil before thee: wherefore thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; and when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou wast wont to hear them from heaven, and thou didst ever deliver them according to thy mercies many times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And thou gavest them warning to bring them back unto thy law: yet they acted presumptuously, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, and sinned against thy ordinances, which a man is to do that he may live through them: and they rendered their shoulder rebellious, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yet thou gavest them indulgence many years, and didst warn them through thy spirit by means of thy prophets; but they gave no ear: therefore didst thou give them up into the hand of the nations of the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet in thy abundant mercies hast thou not made an entire end of them, and thou hast not forsaken them; for a gracious and merciful God art thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest the covenant and kindness, let not be esteemed as little before thee all the hardship that hath befallen us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless thou art righteous in all that is come over us; for thou hast acted according to truth, but we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also our kings, our priests, and our fathers have not executed thy law, and have not listened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst warn them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But they in their kingdom, and in thy abundant goodness which thou hadst given unto them, and in the ample and fat land which thou hadst given up before them, did indeed not serve thee, and they turned not away from their wicked deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Behold, we are this day servants: and as regardeth the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat its fruit and its good things, behold, we are servants in it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it yieldeth its products in abundance for the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins; also over our bodies have they dominion, and over our cattle also at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And because of all this, we make a faithful covenant, and write it down; and on the sealed document are our princes, our Levites, and our priests.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
