And I gathered them together, and placed them on their posts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I appointed receivers over the treasuries, Shelemyah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and Pedayah of the Levites; and with them acted Chanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Matthanyah; for they were accounted as faithful, and it was their duty to make a distribution among their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my pious deeds which I have done for the house of my God, and for those that had charge of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading burdens on asses, as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them on the day whereon they sold provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also the men of Tyre that dwelt therein brought fish and all kinds of wares, and sold them on the sabbath unto the children of Judah and in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this which ye are doing, and profaning thereby the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Did not your fathers act thus, wherefore our God brought over us all this evil, and over this city? and ye bring yet more wrath over Israel by profaning the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, that, when the shadows were lengthened in the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I gave the order, whereupon the gates were locked, and I ordered that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my young men did I place at the gates, that there should be brought in no burden on the sabbathday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thereupon did I warn them, and said unto them, Why do ye lodge along the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I ordered the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep watch at the gates, to sanctify the sabbathday. Also this remember unto me, O my God, and shield me according to the abundance of thy kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In those days also I saw certain Jews that had brought home wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And their children spoke partly in the speech of Ashdod, and did not understand to speak in the Jewish language, but according to the language of one or the other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, nor for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not Solomon the king of Israel sin by these things? and although among the many nations there was never a king like him, and beloved as he was by his God, and God had placed him as king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did the alien women mislead to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shall we then hear it said of you, that ye do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in bringing home alien wives?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the sons of Joyada, the son of Elyashib the high priest, was soninlaw to Sanballat the Choronite; wherefore I chased him away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Remember this unto them, O my God, because of the defilements of the priesthood, and of the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus cleansed I them from all aliens, and I appointed the watches of the priests and the Levites, every one in his work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And for the procuring of the wood, at fixed time, and for the firstfruits. Remember this unto me, O my God, for good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
