But they were thinking of doing me mischief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it lying, and come down to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they sent unto me after this manner four times; and I answered them after the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then sent Sanballat unto me in like manner the fifth time his young man with an open letter in his hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therein was written, It hath been heard among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think of rebelling; wherefore thou art building up the wall; and that thou art to be king unto them, according to these reports.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And that thou hast also set up prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem, saying, He is king in Judah: and now there may be reported to the king something like these words. Now therefore come, and let us take counsel together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I sent unto him, saying, "There hath been done nothing like these reports of which thou speakest; but out of thy own heart thou inventest them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they all wished to make us afraid, thinking, Their hands will be withdrawn from the work, so that it will not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I came also into the house of Shemayah the son of Delayah the son of Mehetabel, who had shut himself up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us lock the doors of the temple; for they are coming to slay thee: yea, in the night are they coming to slay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I said, Should a man like me flee? and who is there that is like me, that would go into the temple and live? I will not go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I perceived that, lo, God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy over me, because Tobiyah and Sanballat had hired him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore was he hired, in order that I should become afraid, and do so, and sin, and that it might serve them for an evil report, so that they might cast reproach upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Think, O my God, of Tobiyah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also of Noadyah the prophetess, and the rest of the prophets, who wished to make me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so was the wall finished on the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard this, and all the nations that were about us saw it, that they sank greatly in their own eyes; and they perceived that by the aid of our God had this work been wrought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah despatched frequently their letters unto Tobiyah, and those of Tobiyah came unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For many in Judah were sworn friends unto him; because he was the soninlaw of Shechanyah the son of Arach, and Jehochanan his son had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Bercehyah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also his good deeds were they reporting before me, and my words they used to carry out to him: also Tobiyah sent letters to make me afraid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
