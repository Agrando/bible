who would say unto him, What dost thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>God will not withdraw his anger: beneath him sink down the helpers of the proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How much less then could I answer him, and select my words to contend with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whom, were I even righteous, I could not answer?
