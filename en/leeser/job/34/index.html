incurable is my wound from the arrow I bear in me without any transgression."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What man is there like Job, who drinketh scorning like water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And is on the road to keep company with the wrongdoers, and to walk with men of wickedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he hath said, "It profiteth a man nothing when he acteth according to the pleasure of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore ye men of sense hearken unto me: far is it from God to practise wickedness; and from the Almighty to do wrong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the work of a son of earth doth he recompense unto him, and according to the path of man doth he permit things to occur to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, surely God will not condemn unjustly, nor will the Almighty pervert justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who hath given him a charge concerning the earth? or who hath intrusted him the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he were to set his heart upon man, he would gather unto himself his spirit and his breath:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All flesh would perish together, and the son of earth would return again unto dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If then thou wishest to understand, hear this: give ear to the sound of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it possible that he who hateth justice should govern? or wilt thou condemn the righteous mighty One?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art worthless? and to princes, Ye are wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whereas he is one that showeth no favor to chieftains, and distinguisheth not the rich before the indigent; for all of them are the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment will they die, and in the midst of the night; people are moved, and pass away: and the mighty will be removed without a human hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For big eyes are upon the ways of man, and all his steps doth he see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the evildoers can hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he need not direct his attention a long time upon man, that he should enter into judgment before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He breaketh down mighty men without long searching, and placeth others in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the reason that he knoweth their deeds: therefore he overturneth them in the night, and they are crushed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Among wicked men doth he strike them, in the place where many see them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because they have departed from following him, and have not considered all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bringing before them the cry of the indigent, and the cry of the afflicted which he had to hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he now granteth rest, who will condemn him! and when he hideth his face, who can behold him? whether it be against a nation, or against one man, it is the same:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That no hypocritical man may reign, that such shall not be a mare to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For truly it is only fitting to say unto God, "I bear cheerfully, I will not do any wrong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What I cannot see myself, do thou truly teach me; if I have done what is unjust, I will do so no more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Should he then according to thy view send a recompense, because thou hast rejected him? "Because thou must choose, and not I?" and what thou knowest, do speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men of sense will say unto me, and every wise man who heareth me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That Job hath not spoken with knowledge, and that his words are without intelligence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Oh that Job may therefore be probed continually, in order to give answers against sinful men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he addeth unto his sin transgression: among us he uttereth too many loud words, and multiplieth his speeches against God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
