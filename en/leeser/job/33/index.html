for with all his words will he not give an answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For God speaketh once, yea twice: yet man regardeth it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumbers upon the couch:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then doth he lay open the ear of men, and sealeth it with their warning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To remove the son of earth from his intended deed and he covereth up pride from man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He withholdeth his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And so is he admonished by pain upon his couch, and all his bones with violent aches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So that his inclination abhorreth bread, and his soul, the most agreeable food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to those that slay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If there be now about him one single angel, as defender, one out of a thousand, to tell for man his uprightness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then is he gracious unto him, and saith, Release him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>His flesh becometh full again as in youth: he returneth to the days of his boyhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He will offer his entreaty unto God, and he will receive him in favor, that he may see his face with joy: so doth He recompense unto the mortal his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He then should assemble men around, and say, "I had sinned, and perverted what is right, yet have I not received a like return."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus he redeemeth his soul from passing into the pit, and his life will look joyously on the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lo, all these things doth God two or three times with man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>To bring back his soul from the pit, that she may shine in the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Listen well, O Job, hearken unto me: keep silence, and I will truly speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If thou hast any words, answer me: speak, for I wish to justify thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If not, hearken thou unto me: keep silence, and I will teach thee wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
