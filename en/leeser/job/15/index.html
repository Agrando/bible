and with words in which there is no profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yea, thou truly makest void the fear of God, and diminishest devotion before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thy iniquity teacheth thy mouth, so that thou choosest the language of the crafty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thy own mouth must condemn thee, but not I: yea, thy own lips will testify against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wast thou born as the first man? or wast thou brought forth before the hills?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hast thou listened to the secret counsel of God? and is wisdom therefore of little esteem with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What knowest thou, that we do not know? what understandest thou, which is not with us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Both the grayheaded and the very aged are among us, richer than thy father in days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Are the divine consolations too little for thee? and the word that was so mild with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whither doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes gaze at?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>That thou shouldst turn against God thy spirit, and utter such words out of thy mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is man, that he should be pure? and that he who is born of woman should be declared righteous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, in his holy ones he putteth no trust; and the heavens are not pure in his eyes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>How much more then the abominable and corrupt, the man who drinketh like water wrongdoing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will instruct thee, hear me; and what I have seen will I relate;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Which wise men have ever told, and have not concealed, as they obtained it from their fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Unto whom alone the earth was given, and into whose midst no stranger ever entered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All his days is the wicked plagued with pain, and the number of years which are laid by for the tyrant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A sound of terrors is in his ears: during peace will the waster come over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is looked for by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that there is ready at his hand the day of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Distress and anguish terrify him: they assail him with might, as a king prepared for the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because he had stretched out against God his hand, and strengthened himself against the Almighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he had run against him, with an extended neck, with the thick roundings of his bucklers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because he had covered his face with his fat, and had made thick folds of fat on his flanks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he dwelt in abandoned cities, in houses which none inhabited, which were destined to be ruinous heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet will he not remain rich, neither will his wealth endure, nor will he attain their perfection on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He will never depart out of darkness: the flame shall dry up his shoots, and he will depart by the breath of Gods mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let him that goeth astray not trust in vanity; for vanity will be what he obtaineth thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Even before his time will it be overfull, and his branches will not be green.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will shake off like the vine his unripe grapes, and cast off like the olive his blossoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the assembly of hypocrites will remain desolate, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They conceive trouble, and bring forth wrongdoing, and their body prepareth deceit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
