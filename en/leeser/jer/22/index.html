behold, thy father ate and drank, but he executed justice and righteousness: then was it well with him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then was it well: is not this the proper knowledge of me? saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thy eyes and thy heart are directed on nothing but upon thy own gain, and upon innocent blood to shed it, and upon oppression, and upon extortion, to practise them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, They shall not lament for him, with, "Woe, my brother!" and, "Woe, sister!" they shall not lament for him, with "Woe, lord!" and, "Woe, to his glory!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>With the burial of an ass shall he be buried, dragged about and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ascend the Lebanon, and cry aloud; and let thy voice resound in Bashan; and cry aloud from Aharim; for crushed are all thy lovers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy very youth, that thou didst not hearken to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall scatter abroad all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded because of all thy wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O inhabitress of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how full of grace wilt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As I live, saith the Lord, though Conyahu the son of Jehoyakim the king of Judah were a signet upon my right hand, yet for a surety would I thence pluck thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will give thee into the hand of those that seek thy life, and into the hand of those of whom thou art afraid, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will hurl thee out, and thy mother that hath born thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land whitherward they direct their soul to return, thither shall they not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Conyahu a despised broken image? or a vessel without value? wherefore are they hurled out, he and his seed, and are cast forth into a land which they know not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O land, land, land! hear the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus hath said the Lord, Write ye down this man as childless, as a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall succeed to sit upon the throne of David, and to rule any more in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
