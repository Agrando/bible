and they that handle the law knew me not; and the shepherds transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied in the name of Baal, and after things that cannot profit did they walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore will I contend yet farther with you, saith the Lord, and with your childrens children will I contend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For pass over to the isles of the Chittites, and see; and unto Kedar send, and consider well and see if any thing like this hath happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Hath a nation exchanged its gods, which are yet no gods? and still my people hath exchanged its glory for that which can not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and let your hair stand at an end, be ye greatly terrified, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For two evils have my people committed: me have they forsaken, the source of living waters, to hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is Israel a servant? or one born to servitude in the house? why hath he been given up to plunder?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That over him young lions roared, let their voice resound, and changed his land into a waste, that his cities are burnt, left without an inhabitant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even the children of Noph and Thachpanches have crushed the crown of thy head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, through thy forsaking the Lord thy God, while he was leading thee on the right way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now what hast thou to do on the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shichor? and what hast thou to do on the way of Asshur, to drink the waters of the river?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy own wickedness shall chastise thee, and thy backslidings shall correct thee; and thou shalt know and see that evil and bitter was thy forsaking the Lord thy God, while the dread of me was not upon thee, saith the Lord Eternal of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because from yore did I break thy yoke, did I burst asunder thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress: nevertheless upon every high hill and under every green tree thou makest thy bed, as harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet I had planted thee as a branch of a noble vine, wholly of the proper seed; but how art thou changed unto me into a degenerate plant of an ignoble vine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though thou wash thyself with natron, and take for thyself much soap: yet would the stain of thy iniquity remain before me, saith the Lord Eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How canst thou say, I am not become unclean, after the Bealim have I not gone? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: like a swift dromedary bound fast to her ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Like a wild ass used to the wilderness, that at her pleasure snuffeth up the wind; her lustwho can turn this away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month will they find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Prevent thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from being thirsty;" but thou saidst, It is useless; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so have the house of Israel been made ashamed, they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who say to the wood, Thou art my father; and to the stone, Thou hast brought us forth; for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their misfortune will they say, Arise, and save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where are then thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy misfortune; for equal to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wherefore will ye contend with me? all of you have transgressed against me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>To no purpose have I smitten your children; correction they accepted not: your sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O present generation, regard ye the word of the Lord. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of deep darkness? wherefore say my people, We wander about; we cannot come any more unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her decorations? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Why ornamentest thou thy way to seek for love? truly even the worst hast thou used thyself as thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also on thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent needy ones: not while breaking in thy house didst thou find them; but for all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yet thou sayest, Yea, I am innocent, surely his anger is already turned away from me. Behold, I will hold judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Why makest thou thyself so very low to change thy way? also because of Egypt shalt thou be made ashamed, as thou wast put to shame because of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also from this one shalt thou go forth, with thy hands clasped over thy head; for the Lord hath rejected those on whom thou trustest and thou shalt not prosper with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
