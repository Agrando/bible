since thou hast accustomed them to be over thee captains, and chiefs? shall not pangs seize upon thee, as on a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if thou wilt say in thy heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thy iniquity are thy skirts laid open, thy heels are made bare violently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away before the wind of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the Lord; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore do I also strip up thy skirts over thy face, that thy shame may be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thy adulteries and thy loud shoutings, the lewdness of thy incest, thy abominations on the hills in the fields have I seen. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean after ever so long a time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
