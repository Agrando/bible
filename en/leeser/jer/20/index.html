And Jeremiah said unto him, Not Pashchur Fulness of Freedom hath the Lord called thy name, but Magormissabib Terror all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall see it; and all Judah will I give into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall lead them into exile to Babylon, and shall smite them with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will give up all the wealth of this city, and all its acquisitions, and all its precious things; and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them, and take them and carry them away to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou, Pashchur, and all the inhabitants of thy house, shall go into captivity; and to Babylon shalt thou come, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied with falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou didst persuade me, O Lord, and I was persuaded; thou laidst thy hand strongly on me, and didst prevail: I am laughed at all the time, every one mocketh me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For as often as I speak must I cry out, violence and wasting must I proclaim; because the word of the Lord is become unto me a disgrace, and a derision, all the time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I thought, I will not make mention of him, and I will not speak any more in his name. But it became in my heart as a burning fire enclosed within my bones, and I was weary with enduring, and I could not overcome it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I heard the defaming of many, angry assemblies on every side, "Tell, and we will tell of him." All the men who ought to seek my welfare, watch for my fall; saying, "Peradventure he may he enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we will then take our revenge on him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the Lord is with me as a mighty powerful one; therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not prevail: they will be greatly ashamed, for they will not prosper; it is an everlasting confusion which will never be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, O Lord of hosts, that probest the righteous, seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I laid open my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed be the day whereon I was born: the day on which my mother bore me shall not be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A manchild is born unto thee. How very glad did he make him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And may that same man become like the cities which the Lord overthrew, and bethought himself not; and may he hear a cry of anguish in the morning, and a tumultuous noise at noontide;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because I was not slain as I escaped from the womb; or that my mother might have become unto me my grave, and her womb have been affected with a perpetual pregnancy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wherefore was this that I came forth out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow, that my days should pass away in shame?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
