Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do any harm, so also to do any good is not in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord: thou alone art great, and great is thy name in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who would not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, they say there is none like unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But at once shall they be shown to be brutish and foolish: it is a doctrine of vanities, it concerneth but wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The beaten out silver is brought from Tharshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the goldsmith: blue and purple is their clothing; the work of skilful men are they all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the Lord God is the truth, he is the living God, and the everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall quake, and nations cannot endure his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, shall perish away from the earth, and from under these heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He made the earth by his power, he established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the sound when he giveth a multitude of waters in the heavens, and causeth clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; when he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then standeth every man as brutish without knowledge; ashamed is every goldsmith because of the graven image; for falsehood is his molten work, and there is no breath therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are vanity, the work of deception; in the time of their punishment shall they vanish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Not like these is the portion of Jacob; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up thy wares from the ground, O inhabitress of the beleaguered city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will cast forth as with a sling the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I will enclose them, in order that they may find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe is me for my breach! my wound is painful; but I thought, This is but pain, and I shall be able to bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now my tent is laid waste, and all my cords are torn asunder; my children are gone away from me, and they are not here; there is no one to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the shepherds were brutish, and the Lord had they not sought; therefore have they not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, the noise of the report is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to render the cities of Judah desolate, a dwelling for monsters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in his own power: it is not in man that passeth away to direct his own steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Correct me, O Lord, but with justice; not in thy anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy fury over the nations that know thee not, and over the families that have not called on thy name; for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his dwelling desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
