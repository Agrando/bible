And all the people assembled themselves against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the kings house unto the house of the Lord, and sat down at the entrance of the new gate of the Lords house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said the priests and the prophets unto the princes and unto all the people, as followeth, This man deserveth the punishment of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your own ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said Jeremiah unto all the princes and unto all the people, as followeth, The Lord hath sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But now amend your ways and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God: and the Lord will bethink him of the evil that he hath spoken against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and just in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye will surely place the guilt of innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon its inhabitants; for in truth hath the Lord sent me unto you to speak in your ears all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets, This man is not deserving the punishment of death; for in the name of the Lord our God hath he spoken unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And then rose up certain men of the elders of the land, and said to all the assembly of the people, as followeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Michah the Morashthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah the king of Judah. and said to all the people of Judah, as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Zion shall be ploughed up like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the house, woody highplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezekiah the king of Judah and all Judah attempt to put him to death? behold, he did fear the Lord, and besought the Lord, and the Lord bethought him of the evil which he had spoken against them. And shall we bring a great wickedness on our souls?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriyah the son of Shemayahu of Kiryathyearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land in accordance with all the words of Jeremiah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when king Jehoyakim, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriyahu heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and arrived in Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But king Jehoyakim sent some men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and some men with him into Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they fetched Uriyahu out of Egypt, and brought him unto king Jehoyakim, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body upon the graves of the common people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the hand of Achikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so as not to give him up into the hand of the people to put him to death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
