But he listened not to him; and Yiriyah seized hold of Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thereupon were the princes wroth with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for that had they made into a prisonhouse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jeremiah had been placed in the dungeon, within the traders shops, where Jeremiah remained many days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>King Zedekiah sent, and had him taken out, and the king asked him in his house in secret, and said, "Is there any word from the Lord?" And Jeremiah said, "There is:" and he said, Into the hand of the king of Babylon shalt thou be given up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I sinned against thee, and against thy servants, and against this people, that ye have put me into the prisonhouse?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And where are now your prophets who have prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon will not come against you, and against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet now, do but hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let me offer my humble supplication, I pray thee, before thee, that thou wilt not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then commanded king Zedekiah that they should put Jeremiah in ward in the court of the prison, and that they should give him a loaf of bread for every day out of the bakers street, until all the bread was spent out of the city. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
