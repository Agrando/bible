So Baruch the son of Neriyahu took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they said unto him, Sit down, we pray thee, and read it before our ears. So Baruch read it before their ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it came to pass, when they heard all the words, they looked terrified at each other, and they said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they asked Baruch, saying, Do tell us, How didst thou write down all these words from his mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said Baruch unto them, With his mouth did he utter clearly all these words unto me, and I wrote them in the book with ink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thyself, thou with Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went in to the king into the court, but the roll they had put in safe keeping in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told before the ears of the king all the words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it before the ears of the king, and before the ears of all the princes who stood around the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the king was sitting in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and a pan of coals was burning before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four pages, that he cut it with the writers knife, and cast it into the fire that was in the coalpan, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the coalpan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yet they were not terrified, nor did they rend their garments, either the king, or any of his servants that had heard all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And although Elnathan and Delayahu and Gemaryahu had also made intercession with the king that he might not burn the roll, he would not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king commanded Yerachmeel the son of the king, and Serayahu the son of Azriel, and Shelemyahu the son of Abdeel, to seize on Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but the Lord hid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, after the king had burnt the roll, and the words which Baruch had written down from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take thee again another roll, and write on it all the former words that have been on the first roll, which Jehoyakim the king of Judah hath burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And concerning Jehoyakim the king of Judah shalt thou say, Thus hath said the Lord, Thou hast indeed burnt this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease therefrom man and beast!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning Jehoyakim the king of Judah, He shall have no one to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat in the day, and to the cold in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will visit on him and on his seed and on his servants their iniquity; and I will bring over them, and over the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and against the men of Judah, all the evil that I have spoken against them, while they did not hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriyahu the scribe; who wrote thereon from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoyakim the king of Judah had burnt in the fire: and there were yet added unto them many words like them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
