saith the Lord: or shall not on a nation such as this my soul be avenged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation; because they are burnt up, so that no man can pass through them; and they hear not the voice of the cattle: both the fowls of the heavens and the beasts are fled; they are gone away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will change Jerusalem into heaps of ruins, a dwelling for monsters: and the cities of Judah will I make desolate, without an inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken, that he may declare it: for what is the land destroyed, burnt up like the wilderness, without one that passeth through?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Lord said, Because they forsook my law which I had set before them, and hearkened not to my voice, and walked not therein;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Bealim, which their fathers had taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed themthis people, with wormwood, and give them poisonwater to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send out after them the sword, till I have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Consider it well, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the women skilled in lament, that they may come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And let them make haste, and take up for us a lamentation, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids drop down water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we wasted! we are greatly ashamed; because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For hear, O ye women, the word of the Lord, and let your ear perceive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For death is come up through our windows, is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from the street, the young men from the open places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Speak, Thus saith the Lord, Yea, the carcasses of men shall lie as dung upon the open field, and as the sheaves left after the harvestman, with none to gather them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus hath said the Lord, Let not the wise glorify himself in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glorify himself in his might, let not the rich glorify himself in his riches;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But let him that glorifieth himself glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord who exercise kindness, justice, and righteousness, on the earth; for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, that I will send punishment on all the circumcised who are yet uncircumcised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On Egypt, and on Judah, and on Edom, and on the children of Ammon, and on Moab, and all who have the locks of their hair cut off round that dwell in the wilderness; for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
