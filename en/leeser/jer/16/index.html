and what is our iniquity? and what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That thou shalt say unto them, Because your fathers forsook me, saith the Lord, and walked after other gods, and served them, and bowed down unto them, and me they forsook, and my law they kept not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye act worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so as not to hearken unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore will I hurl you out of this land into the land of which ye had no knowledge, neither ye nor your fathers; and ye will serve there other gods by day and by night; so that I will not grant you any favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when it shall not he said any more, As the Lord liveth, who hath brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, As the Lord liveth, who hath brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries whither he had driven them: and I will cause them to return unto their land which I have given unto their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishermen, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after that will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For my eyes are directed upon all their ways, they are not hidden from my face, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And thus will I pay them at the first their twofold iniquity and their sin; because they have defiled my land, filling my heritage with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge on the day of trouble, unto thee shall nations come from the ends of the earth, and say, Nothing but falsehood had our fathers inherited, vanity, wherein there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>How?
