If it seem good in thy eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will direct my eye unto thee; but if it seem ill in thy eyes to come with me to Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and proper in thy eyes to go, thither go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And as he did not yet turn about, he said, Go then back to Gedalyah the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath appointed governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him in the midst of the people; or wheresoever it seemeth proper in thy eyes to go, go. And the captain of the guard gave him an allowance and a present, and then dismissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So did Jeremiah come unto Gedalyah the son of Achikam to Mizpah; and he dwelt with him in the midst of the people that had been left in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when all the captains of the armies who were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedalyahu the son of Achikam governor over the land, and that he had entrusted unto him men, and women, and children, and these of the poorest of the land, of those that had not been carried away into exile to Babylon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then came they to Gedalyah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethanyahu, and Jochanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareach, and Serayah the son of Tanchumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Yezanyahu the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Gedalyahu the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and unto their men, saying, Have no fear to serve the Chaldeans: remain in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans, who will come unto us; but ye, gather ye together wine, and summerfruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities of which ye have taken possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And so likewise all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant unto Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedalyahu the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And then did all the Jews return out of all places whither they had been driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedalyahu, unto Mizpah, and gathered together wine and summerfruits in very great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the captains of the armies that were in the field, came to Gedalyahu to Mizpah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they said unto him, Dost thou at all know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethanyah to deprive thee of life? But Gedalyahu the son of Achikam believed them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jochanan the son of Kareach said to Gedalyahu secretly in Mizpah, as followeth, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethanyah, and no man shall know of it: wherefore should he deprive thee of life, whereby all the Jews who are gathered unto thee would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah be lost?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Gedalyahu the son of Achikam said unto Jochanan the son of Kareach, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest a falsehood concerning Ishmael.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
