Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Woe unto Nebo! for it is wasted; made ashamed, captured is Kiryathayim; made ashamed is Misgab and dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There is no more praise of Moab: in Cheshbon have they devised evil against it, "Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation." Also thou Madmen shalt be ruined; after thee shall pursue the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There is a voice of crying from Choronayim, destruction and a great breach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Broken down is Moab: her little ones send forth a cry of distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the ascent of Luchith is ascended with weeping and tears; for on the descent of Choronayim the enemies have heard the cry of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee, save your life, and be ye like the solitary tree in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For, because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be conquered: and Kemosh shall go forth into exile, with his priests and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the water shall come over every city, and no city shall escape: and lost shall be the valley, and destroyed shall be the plain, as the Lord hath said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Give wings unto Moab, that she may flee and get away; since her cities shall become desolate, without any to dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord negligently, and cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moab was ever at ease from his youth, and he was resting on his lees, and was not emptied from vessel to vessel, and had not gone into exile: therefore had his taste remained in him, and his scent was not changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will send unto him tappers, that shall tap him, and they shall empty his vessels, and dash in pieces their bottles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moab shall be ashamed of Kemosh, as the house of Israel were made ashamed because of Bethel their confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How can ye say, We are mighty and men of bravery for the war?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moab is wasted, and into his cities hath the enemy ascended, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, the Lord of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Near is the calamity of Moab to come, and his misfortune hasteneth fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All ye that are about him bemoan him; and all ye that know his name: say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful stick!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, thou inhabitress, daughter of Dibon; for the waster of Moab cometh up against thee, he destroyeth thy strongholds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Stand by the way, and look out, O inhabitress of Aroer: ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, say, What hath been done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moab hath been made ashamed; for it is broken down; wail, and cry aloud: tell ye it by the Arnon, that Moab is wasted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And punishment is come over the land of the plain, over Cholon, and over Yahzah, and over Mephaath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And over Dibon, and over Nebo, and over Bethdiblathayim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And over Kiryathayim, and over Bethgamul, and over Bethmeon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And over Keriyoth, and over Bozrah, and over all the cities of the land of Moab, that are far and that are near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hewn away is the horn of Moab, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Make him drunken; for he magnified himself against the Lord: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall become an object of derision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For was not Israel a derision unto thee?

Thus far is the punishment of Moab.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
