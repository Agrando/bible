who hath listened to his word and heard it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, the stormwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, yea, a whirling storm: upon the head of the wicked shall it fall grievously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of the Lord will not return, until he have executed, and until he have fulfilled the purposes of his heart: in the end of days shall ye understand this fully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I had not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I had not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my secret counsel, they should have announced my words to my people, and have caused them to turn back from their evil way, and from the wrongfulness of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Am I a God for those near at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God for those who are afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If a man should hide himself in secret places should I not then see him? saith the Lord. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth? saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy falsely in my name, saying, I have dreamt, I have dreamt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long shall it be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy falsehood? yea, the prophets of the deceit of their own heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How long do they think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they relate every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name for the sake of Baal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet that hath had a dream, let him relate his dream; and he that hath received my word, let him speak my word of truth. What hath the straw to do with the corn? saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is not thus my word, like the fire? saith the Lord, and like a hammer that shivereth the rock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that use their own word, and say, The Lord saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, I am against those that prophesy with false dreams, saith the Lord, and do relate them, and mislead my people by their falsehoods, and by their vain boasting: while I have not sent them, nor commanded them; and they cannot bring the least profit to this people, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if this people, or the prophet, or a priest, should ask thee, saying, What is the message of the Lord? then shalt thou say unto them, Because of this "What is the message?" will I even cast you off, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that will say, "A message of the Lord," I will even inflict punishment on that man and on his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath the Lord answered? and, What hath the Lord spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But "A message of the Lord" shall ye not mention any more; for the message cometh indeed to the man of his prophetic word; but ye pervert the words of the living God, of the Lord of hosts our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the Lord answered thee? and, What hath the Lord spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if ye will say, "A message of the Lord," then thus saith the Lord, Because ye say this word, "A message of the Lord," and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, "A message of the Lord:"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, behold, I am here, and I will tear you completely away, and I will cast you off, and the city that I have given to you and to your fathers, out of my presence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will lay upon you an everlasting disgrace, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
