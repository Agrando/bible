My eyes shall run down with tears night and day, and they shall not cease; for with a great breach is the virgindaughter of my people broken, with a very painful blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go forth into the field, behold, there are the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, behold, there are those that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest travel round into a land that they know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast thou entirely rejected Judah? or hath thy soul loathing on Zion? why hast thou smitten us, so that there is no healing for us? we hoped for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold, there is terror!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We know, O Lord, our wickedness, the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not cast us off, for the sake of thy name, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the vanities of the nations those that bestow rain? or can the heavens give forth showers? Behold, thou art this, O Lord our God, and we will hope in thee; for thou hast done all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
