But I also, behold, I have seen it, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did unto it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, whereas ye have done all these acts, saith the Lord, and I spoke unto you, causing the prophets to rise up early and speaking, while ye would not hear; and I called you, but ye would not answer:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, whereon ye rely, and unto the place which I have given to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will cast you out of my presence, as I have cast out all your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But thoupray not thou in behalf of this people, nor lift up in their behalf entreaty or prayer, nor make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Dost thou not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and they pour out drinkofferings unto other gods, in order to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do they provoke me to anger? saith the Lord, and not themselves, to the shame of their own faces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, over man, and over beast, and over the trees of the field, and over the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and it shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Add your burntofferings unto your peacesacrifices, and eat the flesh thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I spoke not with your fathers, and I commanded them not on the day of my bringing them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burntoffering or sacrifice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this thing did I command them, saying, Hearken to my voice, and I will be unto you for a God, and ye shall be unto me for a people; and walk ye altogether on the way which I may command you, in order that it may be well unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yet they hearkened not, and inclined not their ear; but they walked in the counsels, in the stubbornness of their evil heart; and they went backward, and not forward:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt until this day; and I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, sending them daily in the morning early;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet they hearkened not unto me, and inclined not their ear; but they hardened their neck; they did worse than their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if thou speak unto them all these words, and they will not hearken to thee; and if thou call unto them, and they will not answer thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then shalt thou say unto them, This is the nation that hearken not to the voice of the Lord their God, and accept not correction; lost is the truth, and is obliterated from their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Cut off thy flowing hair, and cast it away, and take up on mountaintops a lamentation; for rejected hath the Lord and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the children of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes, saith the Lord: they have set up their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they have built the highplaces of Thophet, which is in the valley of Benhinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I had not commanded, and which never came into my mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, behold days are coming, saith the Lord, that it shall not be called any more Thophet, or The valley of Benhinnom, but The valley of slaughter: and they shall bury in Thophet, for want of room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the carcasses of this people shall become food unto the fowls of the heavens, and unto the beasts of the earth, with none to chase them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; for a desert shall the land become.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
