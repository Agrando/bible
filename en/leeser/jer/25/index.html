but ye have not hearkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, making them rise early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, and have not inclined your ear to hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They said, O do turn away every one from his evil way, and from the wrongfulness of your doings; and ye shall remain in the land that the Lord hath given unto you and to your fathers, for from eternity to eternity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And go not after other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will not injure you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet have ye not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord: in order that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your own hands to your own injury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Because ye have not hearkened to my words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, and to Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them over this land, and over its inhabitants, and over all these nations round about, and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a derision, and perpetual ruins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will banish from them the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the mill, and the light of the lamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this whole land shall become a ruin and an object of astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are completed, that I will visit on the king of Babylon, and on that nation, saith the Lord, their iniquity, and on the land of the Chaldeans, and will change it into perpetual desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will bring over that land all my words which I have spoken concerning it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied concerning all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For when many nations and great kings shall have made them also serve: I will then recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel unto me, Take the cup of the wine of this fury out of my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they shall drink, and reel about, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I took the cup out of the hand of the Lord, and caused to drink all the nations, unto whom the Lord had sent me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and its kings, and its princes, to make them a ruin, an astonishment, a derision, and a curse; as it is this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all the confederated nations, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gazzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Dedan, and Thema, and Buz, and all those that have their hair cut round;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the confederated nations that dwell in the wilderness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And all the kings of the north, that are far and that are near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth;

Ye shall not remain unpunished; for a sword am I calling up over all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But thou, do thou prophesy concerning them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord will cry aloud from on high, and from his holy habitation will he send forth his voice; he will cry out very loudly over his habitation; the vintners call, as they that tread out the grapes, will he lift up against all the inhabitants of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>A tumultuous noise cometh even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he holdeth judgment over all flesh: the wicked,these he giveth up to the sword, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil goeth forth from nation to nation, and a great stormwind waketh up from the farthest ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the slain of the Lord shall be on that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, nor gathered up, nor buried; they shall be as dung upon the surface of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and roll yourselves about in the dust, ye leaders of the flocks; for full are your days for you to be slaughtered, and I will scatter you; and you shall fall like a costly vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And lost shall be the place of refuge for the shepherds, and the escape for the leaders of the flocks to escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>There is the voice of the cry of anguish of the shepherds, and the wailing of the leaders of the flocks; for the Lord hath devastated their pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And in silent desolation lie the pasturelands of peace, because of the fierceness of the anger of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He hath forsaken his covert, like the young lion; for their land is become desolate, because of the fierceness of the wasting sword, and because of the fierceness of his anger.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
