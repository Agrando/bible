And Jeremiah did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and brought him up out of the pit: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then sent king Zedekiah, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that was in the house of the Lord; and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee something: conceal nothing from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, If I should tell it unto thee, behold, thou wilt surely put me to death; and if I should give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So king Zedekiah swore unto Jeremiah secretly, saying, As the Lord liveth, who hath made for us this soul, I will not put thee to death, nor will I give thee up into the hand of these men that seek thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If thou wilt indeed go forth unto the princes of the king of Babylon, then shall thy soul live, and this city shall not be burnt with fire; and thou shalt live, thou with thy household;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if thou wilt not go forth to the princes of the king of Babylon, then shall this city be given up into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou thyself shalt not escape out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said king Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, I am in dread of the Jews that have run away to the Chaldeans, lest these deliver me into their hand, and they might illuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Jeremiah said, They will not give thee up. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord, in that which I speak unto thee; so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shown me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Judah shall be led forth to the princes of the king of Babylon; and these women shall say, "They have enticed, and have overpersuaded theethy men that should have sought thy welfare; thy feet are now sunk in the mire, and they have withdrawn themselves backward."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all thy wives and thy children shall they bring out to the Chaldeans; and thou thyself shalt not escape out of their hand; for by the hand of the king of Babylon shalt thou be caught; and this city wilt thou cause to be burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, that thou mayest not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if the princes should hear that I have spoken with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, tell us, we pray thee, what thou hast spoken unto the king, conceal it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king hath spoken unto thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then shalt thou say unto them, I presented my humble supplication before the king, that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan, to die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And all the princes came unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them in accordance with all these words that the king had commanded. And they turned away silent from him; for the matter had not been made public.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And it came to pass when Jerusalem was captured,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
