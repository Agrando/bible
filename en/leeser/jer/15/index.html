I have not lent, nor have men lent to me: yet every one of them curseth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord said, Truly I will release thee for thy good; truly I will cause the enemy to meet thee in the time of distress and in the time of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can iron break in pieces the northern iron and copper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thy wealth and thy treasures will I give up as spoil without price, and this for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will cause them to pass over with thy enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in my anger, over you shall it burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou well knowest it, O Lord! remember me and think of me, and avenge me on my persecutors; not according to thy longsuffering act thou for me: know, that for thy sake I have borne shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When thy words were made manifest to me, then I greedily received them; and thy word became unto me the gladness and joy of my heart; for thy name is called upon me, O Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I sat not in the assembly of the mirthful, and was rejoiced; because of thy inspiration I sat solitary; for thou hadst filled me with indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable? it refuseth to be healed; it is truly become unto me as a deceptive spring, as waters that are not reliable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord, If thou return, and I bring thee back again, then shalt thou stand before me; and if thou bring forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: these shall return unto thee; but thou shalt not return unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will make thee unto this people as a fortified brazen wall; and they will fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the grasp of the tyrants.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
