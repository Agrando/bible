"This is Zion, whom no one seeketh after."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will bring back again the captivity of the tents of Jacob, and on his dwellingplaces will I have mercy; and the city shall be rebuilt upon her own heap of ruins, and the palace shall be inhabited after its ancient manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there shall proceed out of them thanksgiving, and the voice of those that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished; I will also make them numerous, and they shall not be made few in number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And their children shall be as aforetimes, and their congregation shall be firmly established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their leader shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me; for who is this that will venture of his own heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall be unto me for a people, and I will be unto you for a God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the stormwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, an abiding stormwind: upon the head of the wicked shall it fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierceness of the anger of the Lord will not turn back, until he have done, and until he have fulfilled the purposes of his heart: in the latter days shall ye understand this.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
