"Woe unto us! for we are wasted."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wash from wrong doing thy heart, O Jerusalem, in order that thou mayest be saved. How long wilt thou let lodge within thee the thoughts of thy wickedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth unhappiness from the mountain of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make ye mention of it to the nations; behold, let it be heard against Jerusalem, that beleaguerers come from a faroff country, and send forth their voice against the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As keepers of a field are they against her round about; because against me hath she been rebellious, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee: this is thy wickedness, which is so bitter, which so reacheth unto thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My bowels, my bowels! I am shaken, at the very chambers of my heart; my heart beateth tumultuously in me; I cannot remain silent; because the sound of the cornet hast thou heard, O my soul, the alarm of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ruin upon ruin is called out; for the whole land is wasted: suddenly are my tents wasted, and in a moment, my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long shall I see the standard, hear the sound of the cornet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Because my people is foolish, me have they not known; sottish children are they, and they have not any understanding: wise are they to do evil, but how to do good they do not know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I look at the earth, and, lo, it is without form and void; and toward the heavens, and their light is gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I look at the mountains, and, lo, they tremble, and all the hills are moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I look, and, lo, there is no man, and all the birds of the heavens are fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I look, and, lo, the fruitful country is a wilderness, and all its cities are laid waste at the presence of the Lord, because of the fierceness of his anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thus hath said the Lord, Desolate shall be the whole land; yet a full end will I not make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this shall mourn the earth, and black shall be the heavens above; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I will not repent, and I will not turn back from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From the noise of horsemen and those that shoot with the bow fleeth the whole city; they go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou, O wasted one, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet, though thou adorn thyself with ornaments of gold, though thou encircle with paint thy eyes: in vain shalt thou make thyself beautiful; the adulterers will despise thee, thy life will they seek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For a voice as of a woman in travail have I heard, the anguish as of one that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that groaneth, that spreadeth out her hands, saying, "Woe is me now! for my soul succumbeth to the murderers."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
