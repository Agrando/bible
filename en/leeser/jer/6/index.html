"Arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day waneth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Cut ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city whose time of punishment is come; she is full of oppression in her midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As a well sendeth forth its waters, so doth she cause her wickedness to spring forth: violence and robbery are heard in her; in my presence there are continually disease and wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, that my soul tear itself not away from thee; that I render thee not desolate, a land which is not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean like a vine the remnant of Israel: carry back thy hand as a grapegatherer frequently to the baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot be attentive: behold, the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary with sustaining it: I must pour it out over the child in the street, and over the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be seized, the aged with him that is full of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their houses shall be transferred unto others, fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand over the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For from their least even unto their greatest, every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one practiseth falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people very lightly, saying, Peace, peace: when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They should have been ashamed, because they had committed an abomination; but they neither felt the least shame, nor did they know how to blush: therefore shall they fall among those that fall; at the time that I punish their sin shall they stumble, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus hath said the Lord, Place yourselves on the ways, and see, and ask after the ancient paths, where is the way which is good, that ye may walk thereon, and find rest for your soul. But they said, We will not walk thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then did I set watchmen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the cornet. But they said, We will not listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O assembly, what guilt is among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, O earth! behold, I will bring evil upon this people, the fruit of their thoughts; because unto my words have they not been attentive, and as regardeth my law,that have they despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To what purpose serveth me the frankincense which cometh from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a faroff country? your burntofferings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not agreeable unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will place before this people stumblingblocks, and thereon shall stumble the fathers and the sons together, the neighbor and his friend, and they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, a people is coming from the north country, and a great nation shall wake up from the farthest ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Bow and spear shall they firmly grasp; cruel are they, and will have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and upon horses do they ride; set in array as one man for the war, against thee, O daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard the fame of himour hands grow feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, pain, as of a woman in giving birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Go not forth into the field, on the road must ye not walk; for there is the sword of the enemy, terror on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>O daughter of my people, gird thyself with sackcloth, and roll thyself in the ashes: a mourning as for an only son prepare unto thee, a most bitter lamentation; for suddenly will the destroyer come over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and probe their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They all are grievous revolters, going about as talebearers, copper and iron: they all are corrupt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows are burnt, by the fire the lead is consumed: in vain the melter refineth; for the wicked are not separated away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Refuse silver men call them; because the Lord hath rejected them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
