And they told it unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. And all the people came before the king; but Israel fled, every man to his tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people were contending throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king hath saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he it was that hath delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from before Abshalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abshalom, whom we had anointed over us, died in battle: and now why are ye silent about bringing the king back?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And king David sent to Zadok and to Ebyathar the priests, saying, Speak ye unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why will you be the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is already come to the king, to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My brothers are ye, my bone and my flesh are ye: wherefore then will you be the last to bring back the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And to Amassa shall ye say, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and may he thus continue to do, if thou shalt not be captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he turned the heart of all the men of Judah, as of one man: and these sent unto the king, Return thou, with all thy servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king returned, and came as far as the Jordan; and Judah came to Gilgal, to go forth to meet the king, to conduct the king over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then hastened Shimi the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bachurim, and went down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there were with him a thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they set hastily over the Jordan before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there went over the ferryboat to carry over the kings household, and to do what was good in his eyes. And Shimi the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was passing over the Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto the king, Let not my Lord impute it unto me as iniquity, neither do thou remember that in which thy servant acted perversely on the day that my Lord the king went forth out of Jerusalem, so that the king should lay it to his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thy servant doth know that I have indeed sinned; and, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my Lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Abishai the son of Zeruyah spoke out and said, Shall Shimi for this not be put to death, because he cursed the Lords anointed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruyah, that ye should become a hindrance this day unto me? shall this day any man be put to death in Israel? for do I not know that this day I am king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the king said unto Shimi, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Mephibosheth the grand son of Saul came down to meet the king, and he had not dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day that the king departed until the day that he came home in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he answered, My Lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said, I will saddle for me the ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he slandered thy servant unto my Lord the king; but my Lord the king is like an angel of God: do then what is good in thy eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For all of my fathers house were nothing but men deserving death with my Lord the king: and yet didst thou set thy servant among those that eat at thy own table. What other merit therefore have I, and what to complain of yet farther unto the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king said unto him, For what purpose speakest thou yet thy words? I have said, Thou and Ziba shall divide the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take the whole, since that my Lord the king is come back in peace unto his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Barzillai the Giladite came down from Rogelim; and he passed over the Jordan with the king, to accompany him over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Barzillai was very aged, eighty years old: and he had sustained the king while he lay at Machanayim; for he was a very great man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee near me in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Barzillai said unto the king, How many yet are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I am eighty years old this day: can I discern between good and evil? or can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? or can I listen yet to the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant become yet a burden unto my Lord the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thy servant will pass a little way over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with this reward?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the sepulchre of my father and of my mother. But, behold, thy servant Kimham will pass over with my Lord the king; and do to him what is good in thy eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the king said, Kimham shall pass over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good in thy eyes: and whatsoever thou wilt desire of me, will I do for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And all the people passed over the Jordan, after the king had passed over; and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then did the king pass on to Gilgal, and Kimham passed on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have conducted the king and his household over the Jordan, and all Davids men with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And all the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye so angry for this matter? have we eaten the least from the king? or hath he given us any gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, Ten parts have we in the king, and also in David have we more right than ye: why then did ye esteem us lightly? and was not our word the very first to bring back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
