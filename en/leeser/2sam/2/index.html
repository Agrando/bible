And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Achinoam the Yizreelitess, and Abigayil, Nabals wife, the Carmelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And then came the men of Judah, and they anointed there David as king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Yabeshgilad were those that buried Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David thereupon sent messengers unto the men of Yabeshgilad, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, that ye have done this kindness unto your Lord, unto Saul, and have buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now may the Lord deal with you in kindness and truth: and as for me also, I will requite you this good deed, because ye have done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant men; for your lord Saul is dead; and also me have the house of Judah anointed as king over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of the army of Saul, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Machanayim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And made him king over Gilad, and over the Ashurites, and over Yizreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Forty years old was Ishbosheth the son of Saul, when he became king over Israel, and two years he reigned. But the house of Judah followed David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the number of days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there went out Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, from Machanayim to Gibon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joab the son of Zeruyah and the servants of David also went out, and they met together by the pool of Gibon: and they sat down, these on the one side of the pool, and the others on the other side of the pool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abner said to Joab, Do let the young men rise up and play before us. And Joab said, They may rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they rose up and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they grasped every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellows side; and they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Chelkathhazzurim, which is by Gibon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the battle was exceedingly fierce on that day; and Abner with the men of Israel was beaten, before the servants of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there were at that place three sons of Zeruyah, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as fleet of foot as any roe in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and he turned not in going to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Abner turned round and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold for thyself on one of the young men, and take thyself his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Abner repeated again to say unto Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? and how should I then lift up my face to Joab thy brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he refused to turn aside; and Abner smote him with the hinder end of the spear under the fifth rib, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died on the spot: and it came to pass, that all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen down and died remained standing still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giach on the way to the wilderness of Gibon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the children of Benjamin assembled themselves together behind Abner, and formed one solid body, and posted themselves on the top of a certain hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall for everlasting the sword devour? knowest thou not that it will be bitter in the end? and how long shall it be, ere thou wilt bid the people to return from pursuing their brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then already in the morning would the people have gone away every one from pursuing his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Joab blew the cornet, and all the people remained standing still, and pursued no more after Israel, and they continued no more to fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abner and his men walked through the plain all that night, and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Machanayim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Joab returned from pursuing Abner; and he gathered all the people together; and there were missed of Davids servants nineteen men and Asahel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the servants of David had smitten many of Benjamin, and of Abners men: three hundred and sixty men died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlechem. And Joab and his men went all that night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
