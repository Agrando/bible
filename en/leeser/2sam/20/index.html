So they were confined until the day of their death, living in widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said the king to Amassa, Call together for me the men of Judah within three days, and thou present thyself here then.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Amassa went to call Judah together; but he remained out longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Abshalom: take thou the servants of thy Lord, and pursue after him, lest he succeed in reaching fortified cities, and withdraw himself from our eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there went out after him Joabs men, and the Kerethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went forth out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They were close by the great stone which is at Gibon, as Amassa came before them. And Joab was girded with his coat, his usual garment, and upon it the girdle of the sword which was fastened upon his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joab said to Amassa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joabs right hand took hold of Amassas beard to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Amassa did not guard himself against the sword that was in Joabs hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. But Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And one man of Joabs people remained standing by him, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, follow Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Amassa was wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he put Amassa aside out of the highway into the field, and threw a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he was removed out of the highway, every man passed on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this one passed through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, which is of Bethmaachah, and all the Berim: and they assembled themselves together, and went also after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a trench against the city, and it stood enclosed by the troops: and all the people that were with Joab were battering to throw down the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then called a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear: say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near as far as hither, that I may speak with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he said, I am. Then said she unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he said, I do hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said she, thus, They ought surely first to have spoken, saying, "Let them ask at least in Abel:" and so would they have come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am one of the peaceful and faithful cities in Israel; thou seekest to overthrow a city and a metropolis in Israel: why wilt thou destroy the inheritance of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should destroy or ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The matter is not so; but a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri is his name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, against David: give him up alone, and I will withdraw from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be cast down to thee over the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the woman came unto all the people with her wisdom; and they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it down to Joab: and he blew the cornet, and they scattered themselves from the city, every man to his tents. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benayah the son of Yehoyada was over the Kerethites and over the Pelethites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Adoram was over the tribute; and Jehoshaphat the son of Achilud was recorder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Ebyathar were priests;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ira also the Yairite was an officer of state unto David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
