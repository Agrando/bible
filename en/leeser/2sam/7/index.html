And is this the desert of man, O Lord Eternal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what can David add yet more to speak unto thee? since thou, O Lord Eternal, knowest well thy servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the sake of thy word, and in accordance with thy own heart, hast thou done all this great thing, so as to let thy servant know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore art thou great, O Eternal God; for there is none like thee, and there is no God beside thee, in accordance with all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And who is like thy people, like Israel, the only nation on the earth, which God went to redeem for himself as a people, and to acquire for himself a name, and to do for you this great deed, and fearful things for thy land to drive out, from before thy people which thou hast redeemed for thyself from Egypt, nations and their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For thou hast established for thyself thy people Israel as a people unto thee for ever; and thou, O Lord, art indeed become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O Eternal God, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, stand firm for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let thy name be magnified unto everlasting, that men may say, The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel: and may the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou, O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, saying, A house will be built up for thee; therefore hath thy servant found the heart to pray unto thee this prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Lord Eternal, thou art the true God, and thy words must become the truth, and thou hast spoken unto thy servant this goodness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now let it please thee and bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Eternal, hast spoken it; and from thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
