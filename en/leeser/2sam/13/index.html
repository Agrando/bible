Wilt thou not tell me? Then said Amnon to him, Thamar the sister of Abshalom my brother do I love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Yonadab said to him, Lie down on thy couch, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, thou must say unto him, Let, I pray thee, Thamar my sister come, and give me some food, and prepare the refreshment before my eyes, in order that I may see it, and eat it out of her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Let, I pray thee, Thamar my sister come, and mix up before my eyes a couple of cakes, that I may enjoy them out of her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then did David send home to Thamar, saying, Do go now to thy brother Amnons house, and prepare for him the refreshment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Thamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, and he was lying down; and she took the dough and kneaded, and mixed it up before his eyes, and baked the cakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat; and Amnon said, Cause every man to go out from me; and they went out, every man, from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Amnon said to Thamar, Bring the refreshment into the chamber, that I may enjoy it out of thy hand. So Thamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them unto Amnon her brother into the chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But she said to him, No, my brother, do not violate me; for such a deed ought not to be done in Israel; do not this scandalous act!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, whither should I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wouldst be like one of the worthless in Israel; but now, O speak, I pray thee, unto the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless, he would not hearken unto her voice; but he overpowered her, and violated her, and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then did Amnon hate her with a very great hatred; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her; and Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said unto him, Do not add this yet greater wrong than the other which thou hast done with me, to send me now away! But he would not listen to her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he called his young man, his servant, and said, Do send this woman away from me, into the street, and lock the door behind her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she had on a garment of divers colors; for thus were usually appareled the kings daughters when virgins, in robes; and his servant brought her out into the street, and locked the door behind her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Thamar put ashes on her head, and the garment of divers colors which was on her she rent: and she placed her hand on her head, and went away and cried as she went along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said to her Abshalom her brother, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now, my sister, keep silence, he is thy brother, take this thing not to thy heart. So Thamar remained, and was secluded in the house of Abshalom her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when king David heard all these things, it displeased him greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Abshalom spoke not with Amnon either bad or good; for Abshalom hated Amnon, because he had violated Thamar his sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after two full years, that Abshalom had sheepshearers at Baalchazor, which is near Ephraim; and Abshalom invited all the kings sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Abshalom came to the king, and said, Behold, now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said to Abshalom, No, my son, do not let us all go now, that we may not be a burden upon thee. And he urged him much, but he would not go, and he blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Abshalom said, If not, let, I pray thee, Amnon my brother go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Abshalom urged him greatly, and he sent with him Amnon and all the sons of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Abshalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye, I pray you, when Annons heart is merry with wine, and I say unto you, Smite Amnon: then kill him, fear not; behold, it is I who command it you; be firm and show yourselves men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the servants of Abshalom did unto Amnon as Abshalom had commanded. Then arose all the kings sons, and they rode off, every man on his mule, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it happened, while they were on the way, that the report came to David, saying, Abshalom hath smitten all the kings sons, and there is not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then arose the king and rent his garments, and laid himself on the earth: and all his servants were standing by with their garments rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Yonadab the son of Shimah, Davids brother, commenced and said, Let not my Lord suppose that they have slain all the young men, the kings sons; since Amnon alone is dead; for by the command of Abshalom was this ordained from the day that he violated Thamar his sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And now let not my Lord the king take the thing to his heart, thinking, that all the kings sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Abshalom flew away. And the young man that was watching lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by the way behind him, by the side of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Yonadab said to the king, The kings sons are come: according to the word of thy servant, so hath it come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it happened, as he had just finished speaking, that, behold, the kings sons came, and they lifted up their voice and wept; and also the king and all his servants wept very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Abshalom had fled; and he went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur: and David mourned for his son all the time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So did Abshalom fly, and go to Geshur, and he remained there three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Abshalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, that he was dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
