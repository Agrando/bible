And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David said unto him, What took place there? I pray thee, tell me. And he said, That the people are fled from the battle, and that also many of the people are fallen and have died; and that also Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul is dead as also Jonathan his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man that told him said, I happened entirely by chance to be upon mount Gilboa, when, behold, there was Saul leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen had overtaken him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he turned round, and he saw me, and called unto me, And I said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said unto me, Who art thou! And I answered him, An Amalekite am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto me, Place thyself, I pray thee, by me, and slay me; for a mortal tremor hath seized on me, although my life is yet whole in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I placed myself by him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after his fall; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them unto my lord hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>David thereupon took hold of his clothes, and rent them; and so did likewise all the men that were with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they lamented, and wept, and fasted until the evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he said, The son of a stranger, an Amalekite, am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the Lords anointed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David called one of the young men, and said, Come near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said unto him, Thy blood is upon thy own head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I myself have slain the Lords anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, That the children of Judah should be taught the bow; behold it is written in the book of Yashar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O beauty of Israel! upon the high places slain: how are the mighty fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; that the daughters of the Philistines may not be glad, that the daughters of the uncircumcised may not rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>O mountains of Gilboa, no dew, nor rain be upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty was stained, the shield of Saul, as though it had not been anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned never back, and the sword of Saul never returned empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the dear in their lives, were even in their death not divided: more than eagles were they swift, more than lions were they strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with beautiful dresses, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, on thy high places slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very dear hast thou been unto me: wonderful was thy love for me, passing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How are the mighty fallen, and lost the instruments of war!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
