And Ziba said, The asses are for the kings household to ride on; and the bread and the dried figs for the young men to eat; and the wine to drink for such as may be faint in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, And where is thy masters son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he remaineth at Jerusalem; for he said, Today will the house of Israel restore unto me the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine shall be all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I prostrate myself; let me but find grace in thy eyes, my Lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when King David came as far as Bachurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimi, the son of Gera, coming forth, and cursing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus said Shimi as he cursed, Away, away, thou man of blood, and thou worthless man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord hath brought back upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou didst reign; and the Lord hath placed the kingdom into the hand of Abshalom thy son; and, behold, thou art now in thy misfortune, because a man of blood art thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruyah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and remove his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruyah? so let him curse; because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who hath come forth out of my own body, seeketh my life: how much more now this Benjamite? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath said it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Perhaps the Lord will look on my affliction, and the Lord will requite me good instead of his cursing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David and his men went thus on the way. And Shimi went on the side of the mount opposite to him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones toward him, and cast dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king, and all the people that were with him, arrived weary, and refreshed themselves there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Abshalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Achithophel also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Chushai the Arkite, Davids friend, was come unto Abshalom, that Chushai said unto Abshalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abshalom said to Chushai, Is this thy kindness for thy friend? why art thou not gone with thy friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Chushai said unto Abshalom, No; but whom the Lord, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And secondly, who is it whom I shall serve? is it not in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy fathers presence, so will I be in thy presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said Abshalom to Achithophel, Hold counsel among yourselves as to what we shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Achithophel said unto Abshalom, Go in unto thy fathers concubines, whom he hath left to guard the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art in bad odor with thy father: and then will the hands of all that are with thee become strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread for Abshalom a tent upon the roof; and Abshalom went in unto his fathers concubines before the eyes of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the counsel of Achithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had asked advice of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Achithophel both with David and with Abshalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
