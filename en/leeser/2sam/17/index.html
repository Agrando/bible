But the Lord had ordained to frustrate the good counsel of Achithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring the evil upon Abshalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said Chushai unto Zadok and to Ebyathar the priests, Thus and thus did Achithophel counsel Abshalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but rather pass over at once; lest the king be entirely ruined, and all the people that are with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Jonathan and Achimaaz were staying by Enrogel; and a maidservant had to go and tell them, that they should go and tell king David; for they dared not be seen to come into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told it to Abshalom; but they went, both of them, quickly away, and came to the house of a man in Bachurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the wife took and spread a covering over the wells mouth, and scattered ground corn thereupon; so that nothing was perceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Abshaloms servants came to the woman into the house, and they said, Where are Achimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are passed over the brook of water. And they sought, but could not find them; and they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, after they were gone, that they came up out of the well, and went and told it to king David, and they said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Achithophel counseled against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then did David arise, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the time the morning was light, not even one was lacking who had not passed over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Achithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled the ass, and arose, and went home to his house, to his city, and gave his charge to his household, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then came David to Machanayim: and Abshalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Abshalom placed Amassa instead of Joab as captain over the army: and Amassa was the son of a man, whose name was Yithra the Israelite, who had gone in to Abigal the daughter of Nachash, the sister of Zeruyah Joabs mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Israel and Abshalom encamped in the land of Gilad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when David was come to Machanayim, that Shobi the son of Nachash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Giladite of Rogelim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Brought beds, and bowls, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And honey, and cream, and sheep, and cows cheese, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat; for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
