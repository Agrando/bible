But David remained behind at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it happened at eveningtide, that David arose from off his couch, and walked upon the roof of the kings house: and he saw from the roof a woman bathing herself; and the woman was of a very beautiful appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David sent and inquired after the woman; and some one said, Behold, this is Bethsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriyah the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her, and she had just purified herself from her uncleanness; and she returned unto her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David sent to Joab, Send unto me Uriyah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriyah to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Uriyah was come unto him, David asked after the wellbeing of Joab, and after the wellbeing of the people, and how the war prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Uriyah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriyah went forth out of the kings house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Uriyah laid himself down at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they told David, saying, Uriyah is not gone down unto his house: and David said unto Uriyah, Art thou not come from a journey? why then art thou not gone down unto thy own house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Uriyah unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in booths; and my Lord Joab and the servants of my Lord are encamped in the open field: and should I alone go unto my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David said unto Uriyah, Tarry here also this day, and tomorrow will I send thee off. So Uriyah remained in Jerusalem on that day and the following.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David invited him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunken; and he went out in the evening to lie down on his restingplace with the servants of his lord; but to his house he did not go down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriyah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriyah in front, opposite to the hottest fight, and then withdraw from behind him, that he may be smitten and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Joab was enclosing the city, that he placed Uriyah toward the spot of which he knew that valiant men were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab; and there fell some of the people, of the servants of David, and there died also Uriyah the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then did Joab send, and told unto David all the events of the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished telling all the events of the war to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it happen that the kings wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore did you approach unto the city to fight? knew ye not, that they would shoot down from off the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who smote Abimelech the son of Yerubbesheth? did not a woman throw down upon him a piece of an upper millstone from off the wall so that he died at Thebez? why did ye approach unto the wall? then must thou say, Also thy servant Uriyah the Hittite is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the messenger went, and came and told unto David all for which Joab had sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the messenger said unto David, Because the men overpowered us and came out against us into the field; but we set upon them, as far as the entrance of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the archers then shot at thy servants from off the wall; and there died some of the servants of the king, and also thy servant Uriyah the Hittite is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said David to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let this thing not be displeasing in thy eyes; for at times this, at other times the other will the sword devour; continue firmly in thy war against the city, and overthrow it: and thus do thou encourage him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the wife of Uriyah heard that Uriyah her husband had died, she mourned for her lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the time of mourning was past, David sent and took her to his house, and she became his wife; and she bore him a son. But the thing which David had done was displeasing in the eyes of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
