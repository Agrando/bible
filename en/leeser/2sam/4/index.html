He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan from Yizreel, and his nurse took him up and fled: and it came to pass, in her haste to flee, that he fell, and was rendered lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came at the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was just lying in bed as usual at noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they came thither into the interior of the house, as buyers of wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Namely, they came into the house, while he was lying on his bed in his sleepingchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and cut off his head, and took his head, and went by the way of the plain all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and they said to the king, Behold, here is the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life: and the Lord hath granted to my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul, and on his seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, and he was in his own eyes as though he brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I should give him a reward for his tidings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed? and now, behold, I will require his blood of your hand, and I will remove you away from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David gave the command to the young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up by the pool in Hebron. But the head of Ishbosheth they took, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
