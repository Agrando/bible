Thus saith David the son of Jesse, and thus saith the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet singer of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me, and his word was upon my tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thus said the God of Israel, concerning me spoke the Rock of Israel, That I should be ruler over men, be righteous, ruling in the fear of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as in the light of morning the sun riseth, in a morning without clouds, with more than the brightness reflected by rain on the herbs that spring from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Truly is not so my house with God? since he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, firm in all, and sure? yea, will he not cause to grow all my salvation, and all my desire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the godless are all of them as waving thorns, which cannot be taken in the hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the man that will touch them must protect his hand with iron and the staff of a spear: and they will be utterly burnt with fire in the dwelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Yoshebbashebeth, the Thachkemonite, the chief among the captains,the same as Adino the Eznite,because of eight hundred slain at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And after him was Elazar the son of Dodo, the son of Achochi, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had withdrawn themselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He then arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand did cleave unto the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory on that day; and the people returned after him only to strip the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after him was Shammah the son of Age the Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, and there was a piece of ground full of lentiles; and the people had fled from the Philistines;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he placed himself in the midst of the ground, and delivered it, and smote the Philistines: and the Lord wrought a great victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these three, the chiefs of the thirty, went down, and came to David at harvesttime unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David was then in the stronghold, and an outpost of the Philistines was then in Bethlechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would bring me water to drink out of the well at Bethlechem, which is by the gate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines; and drew water out of the well of Bethlechem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink thereof, and poured it out unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Far be it from me, O Lord, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went at the risk of their life? and thus he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruyah, was the chief of these three; and he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain, and had a name among the three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Although he was the most honored of the three, wherefore he became their captain: he nevertheless attained not unto the three in prowess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, the son of a valiant man, great in many acts of Kabzeel; he it was that smote the two lionlike heroes of Moab; he also went down and slew a lion in the midst of a pit on a day when it snowed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he slew an Egyptian, a man of good appearance; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and he snatched the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and slew him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things did Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, and he had a name among the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He was more honored than the thirty; but he attained not to these three.
