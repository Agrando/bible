And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and the accident happened to her, that it was a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlechem, and he said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you. And they said unto him, May the Lord bless thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said Boaz unto his young man that was appointed over the reapers, Whose maiden is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man that was appointed over the reapers answered and said, It is a Moabitish maiden that is returned with Naomi out of the fields of Moab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather among the sheaves after the reapers: so she came, and hath remained ever from the morning even until now; it is but a little while that she hath sat down in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go away from this; but keep close company with my own maidens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let thy eyes be on the field which they may reap, and go thou after them; behold, I have charged the young men that they shall not touch thee: and when thou art thirsty, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men may draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thereupon she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thy eyes, that thou shouldst take cognizance of me, seeing I am but a stranger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy motherinlaw after the death of thy husband; and how thou hast forsaken thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not yesterday or the day before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May the Lord recompense thy work, and may thy reward be complete from the Lord the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to seek shelter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said she, Let me find grace in thy eyes, my lord; for thou hast comforted me, and because thou hast spoken kindly unto the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not like one of thy handmaids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come near hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she seated herself beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she ate, and was satisfied, and had some left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then did she arise to glean: and Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Even between the sheaves let her glean, and do not cause her to feel any shame;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And ye shall also draw out some for her from the bundles on purpose, and leave it, that she may glean it, and ye shall not rebuke her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So she gleaned in the field until the evening; and when she beat out what she had gleaned, it was about an ephah of barley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she took it up, and she went into the city; and her motherinlaw saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her what she had left over after she was satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And her motherinlaw said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned today? and where hast thou wrought? may he that took cognizance of thee be blessed. And she told her motherinlaw with whom she had wrought, and said, The name of the man with whom I wrought today is Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said Naomi unto her daughterinlaw, Blessed be he unto the Lord, who hath not withheld his kindness from the living and from the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nearly related unto us, he is one of our next kinsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ruth the Moabitess said, He hath also said unto me, Thou shalt keep close company with my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said Naomi unto Ruth her daughterinlaw, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that men may not meet with thee in any other field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So she kept close company with the maidens of Boaz in gleaning until the end of the barleyharvest and of the wheatharvest; and she dwelt with her motherinlaw.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
