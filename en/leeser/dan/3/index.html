Then were these men brought before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nebuchadnezzar commenced and said unto them, Is it out of disrespect, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? My god ye do not worship, and to the golden image which I have set up ye do not bow yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now then if ye be ready at the time when ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, guitar, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and bow yourselves to the image which I have made, well ; but if ye bow yourselves not, ye shall be cast in the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is the God that can deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then answered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee a word in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, there is our God whom we worship, he is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace: and out of thy hand, O king, will he deliver us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if not, then be it known unto thee, O king, that thy god will we not worship, and to the golden image which; thou hast set up will we not bow ourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of his countenance was changed because of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; and he commenced and ordered that they should heat the furnace thoroughly seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he ordered the mightiest men in strength that were in his army, to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then were these men bound in their mantles, their undergarments, and their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now, because the kings command was so urgent, and the furnace exceedingly heated, the flame of the fire slew those men that carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then was king Nebuchadnezzar astonished, and he rose up in haste, and commenced, and said unto his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, Certainly, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and there is no injury on them; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came Nebuchadnezzar near to the door of the burning fiery furnace, commenced, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, step forth, and come hither. Then stepped Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego forth out of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the lieutenants, superintendents, and governors, and the kings counsellors, being assembled together, saw these men, over whose bodies the fire had had no power, and the hair of whose head was not singed, whose mantles were not changed, and on whom there was not come the smell of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then commenced Nebuchadnezzar, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that had trusted in him, and had transgressed the kings word, and yielded up their bodies, that they might not worship no bow themselves to any god, except their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore do I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, that may speak any thing disrespectful against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be changed into a dunghill; because there is no other God that can deliver like this one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then did the king promote Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
