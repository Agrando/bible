The king answered and said, The thing is certainly so, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot he repealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the exiles of Judah, hath paid no regard to thee, O king, nor to the prohibition which thou hast signed; but three times every day he offereth up his prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the king, when he heard this matter, felt very much distressed within himself, and on account of Daniel he sought an excuse to deliver him; and till the going down of the sun he strove hard to rescue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then came these men tumultuously unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians. That every prohibition and statute which the king hath established is not to be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then gave the king the order, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. The king commenced and said unto Daniel, May thy God whom thou worshippest continually, truly deliver thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a stone was brought, and placed upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signetring, and with the signetring of his lords, that nothing should be changed in the purpose concerning Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then went the king to his palace, and passed the night fasting: and no food was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then arose the king by the morningdawn, as soon as it was light, and went in great haste unto the den of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he came near to the den, he cried with a mournful voice unto Daniel: the king commenced and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou worshippest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lions!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then spoke Daniel with the king, O king, live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My God sent his angel, and locked up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, had I done nothing injurious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then was the king exceedingly glad within himself, and concerning Daniel he ordered to bring him up out of the den. So was Daniel brought up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king gave the order, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel treacherously, and they cast into the den of lions them, their children, and their wives; and they had not yet touched the bottom of the den when the lions had the mastery over them, and ground up all their bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then wrote king Darius unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell on all the earth, May your welfare increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>From me is it decreed, That in all the dominion of my kingdom men shall tremble and have fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and endureth for ever, and it is his kingdom which will not be destroyed, and his dominion will be unto the end of things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He delivereth and rescueth, and he displayeth sings and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
