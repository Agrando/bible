And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood up trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to obtain understanding, and to fast before thy God, were thy words heard: and I am come in consequence of thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood up against me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I obtained the victory there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now am I come to make thee understand what is to befall thy people, in the latter days; for the vision is yet for the coming days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he spoke unto me such words, I directed my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, something like the form of the sons of men touched my lips; and I opened my mouth, and I spoke, and said unto him that stood opposite to me, O my lord, because of the appearance my pains suddenly overcame me, and I have retained no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And how shall the servant of this my lord be able to speak with this my lord? And as for me, from that moment there remained no strength in me, and no breath was left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then there touched me again something like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, Fear not, O man greatly beloved: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spoke with me, I felt myself strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia; and as I am going forth, lo, the prince of Javan is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless will I tell thee what is noted down in the writing of truth:and there is none that holdeth with me to assist me against those, except Michael your prince.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
