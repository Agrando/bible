and ye would thus endanger my head with the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Daniel to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had given charge over Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Prove, I beseech thee, thy servants, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And then let our countenances be looked at before thee, and the countenance of the lads that eat the food of the king: and as thou mayest see fitting, so deal with thy servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fuller in flesh than that of all the lads who ate the food of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the steward took away their apportioned food, and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as regardeth all these four lads, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And at the end of the days after which the king had said that they should be presented, the chief of the eunuchs presented them before Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the king spoke with them; and there was not found among them all any one like Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah: and so they served before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in every matter of wise understanding, which the king required of them, he found them ten times superior above all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
