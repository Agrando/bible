The king then commenced, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or its interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, O that the dream might be for those that hate thee, and its interpretation for thy enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree that thou hast seen, which grew, and was strong, the height of which reached unto the heaven, and which was visible to all the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The foliage of which was splendid, and the fruit of which was large, and on which was food for all; under which dwelt the beasts of the field, and in the boughs of which nestled the fowls of the heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; and thy greatness is grown apace, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion is to the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, who said, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the body of its roots in the earth, but bound in fetters of iron and copper, among the grass of the field; and let it be made wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times elapse over it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the resolve of the Most High, which will come over my lord the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They will drive thee away from men, and with the beasts of the field is thy dwelling to be, and they will suffer thee to eat herbs like oxen, and they will suffer thee to be made wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will elapse over thee; until that thou wilt know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he pleaseth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whereas they ordered to leave the body of the roots of the tree: thy kingdom will remain unto thee, as soon as thou wilt know that the Heavens do rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be agreeable unto thee, and atone for thy sins by righteousness, and for thy iniquities by showing kindness to the poor: perhaps thy prosperity may thereby endure long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this came over king Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace at Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king commenced, and said, Is not this Babylon the great, that I myself have built for a royal residence by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The word was still in the kings mouth, when there fell a voice from heaven, saying, To thee it is said, O king Nebuchadnezzar, The kingdom departeth from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And from men will they drive thee away, and with the beasts of the field shall thy dwelling be; herbs like oxen will they suffer thee to eat, and seven times shall elapse over thee: until thou wilt know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he pleaseth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>At the same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and from men was he driven away, and herbs like oxen had he to eat, and with the dew of heaven was his body made wet: till his hair was grown like eagles feathers, and his nails were like birds claws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified the Everliving, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and whose kingdom is over every generation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And by whom all the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nought; and who according to his pleasure doth with the host of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth; while there is none that can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>At the same time my understanding returned unto me; and with the glory of my kingdom, my honor and my splendor returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought for me: and I was replaced in my kingdom, and additional greatness was added unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and glorify the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and whose ways are justice; and who is able to bring low those that walk in pride.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
