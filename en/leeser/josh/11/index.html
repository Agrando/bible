for tomorrow about this time will I give all of them up slain before Israel: their horses shalt thou hamstring and their chariots shalt thou burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and pursued them unto great Zidon, and unto Missrephothmayim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none that escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua did unto them as the Lord had said unto him: their horses he hamstringed and their chariots he burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua at that time turned back, and captured Chazor, and its kings he smote with the sword; for Chazor aforetimes was the head of all these kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, and devoted them; there was not left any one having breath; and Chazor he burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, did Joshua capture, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and he devoted them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for the cities that had been left standing in their strength, these did Israel not burn: save Chazor only did Joshua burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, did the children of Israel take as booty unto themselves; but all the men they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them: they left not any one having breath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joshua took all that land, the mountain, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowlands, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and its lowlands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From the bald mountain that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Chermon; and all their kings he captured, and smote them, and slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A long time did Joshua make war with all these kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibon: the whole they took by war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For of the Lord it was to harden their heart, that they should come against Israel in battle, in order to destroy them utterly, that they might obtain no favor: but in order that he might exterminate them, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from the whole mountain of Judah, and from the whole mountain of Israel: with their cities did Joshua destroy them utterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gazzah, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joshua took the whole land, all just as the Lord had spoken unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel, according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
