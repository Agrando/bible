when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the children of Israel did so as Joshua had commanded; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord had spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Twelve stones also did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, on the spot where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood: and they have remained there unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hastened and passed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when all the people had finished passing over, that the ark of the Lord passed over with the priests in the presence of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>About forty thousand ready armed for war, did they pass over before the Lord unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>On that day the Lord made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord said unto Joshua, as followeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all its banks, as on the preceding days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the extreme eastern border of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those twelve stones, which they had taken out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said unto the children of Israel, thus, When your children shall ask in time to come their fathers, saying, What mean these stones?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then shall ye let your children know, saying, On dry land did Israel pass over this Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In order that all the nations of the earth may know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty;
