And Joshua stretched out the spear which was in his hand toward the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took possession of it, and hastened and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Ai turned and looked behind them, and they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had seized the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended: they turned back, and smote the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the others issued out of the city against them; so that the Israelites had them in the middle, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, until there was not left of them one that remained or escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the king of Ai they caught alive, and brought him to Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, that, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they had pursued them, and when they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, All the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the number of all that fell in that day, both of men and women, was twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he had stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty unto themselves, according to the word of the Lord which he had commanded Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a ruinous heap of desolation for ever, even unto this day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide; and at the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took his carcass down from the tree and cast it at the entrance of the city gate, and they raised over him a great heap of stones, which is even unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then did Joshua build an altar unto the Lord, the God of Israel on mount Ebal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no one had lifted up any iron tool; and they offered thereon burntofferings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peaceofferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all Israel, and their elders, and the officers, and their judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark, opposite the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, the stranger no less than the native born: half of them turned toward mount Gerizzim, and the other half of them turned toward mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded, to bless the people of Israel at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, all, just as it is written in the book of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the stranger that walked in the midst of them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
