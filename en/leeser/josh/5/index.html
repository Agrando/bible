And he called the name of the place Gilgal unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and they prepared the passoveroffering on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they ate of the corn of the land on the morrow after the passoveroffering, unleavened cakes and parched corn, on the selfsame day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the corn of the land; and the children of Israel had not any more manna; but they did eat of the product of the land of Canaan during that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, a man was standing over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, No; for I am a captain of the host of the Lord: now am I come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed himself, and said to him, What doth my lord speak unto his servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the captain of the Lords host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
