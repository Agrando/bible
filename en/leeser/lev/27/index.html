according to the ability to pay of him that hath vowed shall the priest value him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if it he a beast, whereof men can bring an offering unto the Lord, all that a man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad one, or a bad for a good one; and if he should change beast for beast, then shall it together with its exchange be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they cannot offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, then shall he present the beast before the priest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest valueth it, so shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he will redeem it, then shall he add a fifth part thereof unto the estimated value.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man sanctify his house as holy unto the Lord, then shall the priest value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest may value it, so shall it stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then shall he add the fifth part of the money of the estimated value unto it, and it shall remain his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man sanctify some part of a field of his possession unto the Lord, then shall the estimation be in proportion to its required seed: the seed of a chomer of barley at fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If immediately after the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field, according to this estimation shall it stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then shall the priest reckon unto him the money in proportion to the years that remain, until the year of the jubilee, and it shall be deducted from the estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it, then shall he add the fifth part of the money of the estimated value unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the field, when it is freed in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a devoted field: to the priest shall it belong as his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if a man sanctify a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession, unto the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then shall the priest reckon unto him the amount of the estimated value to the year of the jubilee; and he shall give this estimation on that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom he bought it, to the one to whom belongeth the possession of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all estimations of value shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Only the firstborn which shall, by being first born, be sacred unto the Lord among cattle, no man shall sanctify; whether it be ox, or lamb, it is the Lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if it be an unclean animal, then shall he redeem it according to the estimated value, and he shall add its fifth part thereto; and if it be not redeemed, then shall it be sold according to the estimated value.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But any devoted thing, which a man may devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall not be sold nor redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Any one condemned, who shall be condemned to death among men, shall not be redeemed: he shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And every tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, belongeth to the Lord; it is holy unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if a man will redeem any part of his tithe, its fifth part shall he add thereto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And concerning the tithe of the herds, or of the flocks, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he should change it, then both it and the exchange thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children on mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
