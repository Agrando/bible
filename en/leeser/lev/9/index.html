and a calf and a sheep, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burntoffering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Also a bullock and a ram for peaceofferings, to sacrifice before the Lord, and a meatoffering mingled with oil;

and prepare the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord hath commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Aaron drew near unto the altar; and he slew the calf of the sinoffering, which was for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar; and the remaining blood he poured out at the bottom of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the fat, and the kidneys, and the midriff from the liver of the sinoffering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he slew the burntoffering; and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the burntoffering they presented unto him, in its proper pieces, together with the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he washed the inwards and the legs; and he burnt them upon the burntoffering on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he brought near the peoples offering; and he took the goat of the sinoffering which belonged to the people, and slew it, and made atonement with its blood, as the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought near the burntoffering, and offered it according to the prescribed manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he brought near the meatoffering, and he filled his hand thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burntsacrifice of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He slew also the bullock and the ram, the sacrifice of peaceoffering which belonged to the people: and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the midriff of the liver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they put these pieces of fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And with the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron made a waving before the Lord; as Moses had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and came down after he had offered the sinoffering, and the burntoffering, and peaceofferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came then out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there came forth a fire from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burntoffering and the fat;
