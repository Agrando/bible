and so soon as the priest shall see him, he shall pronounce him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But if it be a white bright spot in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance be not deeper than the skin, and the hair be not turned white: then shall the priest shut up the plague seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the priest shall see him on the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague have remained unchanged in its appearance, the plague have not spread in the skin: then shall the priest shut him up seven days more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall see him again on the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be somewhat pale, and the plague have not spread in the skin: then shall the priest pronounce him clean; it is a rising, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the rising should spread abroad in the skin, after he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen again by the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the priest see that, behold, the rising have spread abroad in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If the plague of leprosy happen to be on a man, then shall he be brought unto the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the priest shall see, and, behold, if there be a white swelling in the skin, and the hair in it have turned white, or there be a trace of healthy flesh in the swelling:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is an inveterate leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean;

he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But if there be on the bald head, or the bald forehead, an eruption, white and dark red: it is the leprosy sprung up on his bald head, or his bald forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the priest shall see him; and, behold, if the swelling of the eruption be white and dark red on his bald head, or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of the leprosy on the other parts of the skin of the flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall pronounce him unclean; his plague is on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the leper on whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head shall be bare, and he shall cover himself up to his upper lip, and, Unclean, unclean, shall he call out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>All the days whereon the plague which rendereth unclean is on him, he shall be unclean;

and it shall be shown unto the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the priest shall see the plague, and shut up the plague seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And if he see the plague on the seventh day, that the plague have spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, or in any article that is made of skin: the plague is a corroding leprosy; it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall then burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any article of skin, whereon the plague is; for it is a corroding leprosy, in fire shall it be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And if the priest shall see, and, behold, the plague have not spread on the garment, either on the warp, or on the woof, or on any article of skin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then shall the priest command that they wash the thing whereon the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And if the priest see, after the plague hath been washed, and, behold, the plague have not changed its color, and the plague have not spread: it is unclean, in fire shalt thou burn it; it is a decay on its inside or on its outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And if the priest see, and, behold, the plague have become pale after its having been washed: then shall he tear it out from the garment, or from the skin, or from the warp, or from the woof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And if it appear again on the garment, either on the warp, or on the woof, or on any instrument of skin: it is a growing plague; with fire shalt thou burn that whereon the plague is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And the garment, either the warp or the woof, or every instrument of skin, which thou shalt wash, and the plague depart therefrom, shall be washed the second time, when it shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This is the law of the plague of leprosy on a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or any article of skin, to pronounce it clean, or unclean.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
