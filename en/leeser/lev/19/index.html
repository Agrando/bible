for I the Eternal your God am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ye shall fear, every man, his mother and his father, and my sabbaths shall ye keep: I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye shall not turn unto the idols, and molten gods shall ye not make to yourselves: I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if ye offer a sacrifice of peaceoffering unto the Lord, ye shall offer it so that it may be favorably received from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On the same day ye offer it shall it be eaten, and on the morrow: and whatever is left until the third day, shall be burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if the intention was that it should be eaten on the third day, it is an abomination, it shall not be favorably received.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And whoever eateth it shall bear his iniquity; because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather up the gleanings of thy harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, and the single grapes that drop in thy vineyard shalt thou not gather up; for the poor and the stranger shalt thou leave them: I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deny anothers property in your hands, nor lie one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and thou shalt not thus profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shalt not withhold any thing from thy neighbor, nor rob him: there shall not abide with thee the wages of him that is hired, through the night until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind; but thou shalt be afraid of thy God: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the great; in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; thou shalt not stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt indeed rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin on account of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My statutes shall ye keep; thy cattle shalt thou not let gender with a diverse kind; thy field shalt thou not sow with mingled seeds; and a garment of mingled kinds, of linen and woollen, shall not come upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if a man lie carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a man, but who hath neither been redeemed, nor hath her freedom been given her: there shall a scourging be decreed; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he shall bring his trespassoffering unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: a ram for a trespassoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespassoffering before the Lord for his sin which he hath done; and he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when ye come into the land, and plant any kind of tree bearing edible fruit, then shall ye count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you, it shall not be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in the fourth year shall all its fruit be holy for praisegiving unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fifth year shall ye eat of its fruit, in order that it may increase unto you its productiveness: I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ye shall not eat upon the blood;

and any etchedin writing shall you not fix on yourselves: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Do not profane thy daughter, to cause her to be a prostitute; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of incest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>My sabbaths shall ye keep, and my sanctuary shall ye reverence: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Turn not unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards; seek them not, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Before the hoary head shalt thou rise up, and honor the face of the old man; and thou shalt be afraid of thy God: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a stranger sojourn with thee, in your land, ye shall not vex him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As one born in the land among you, shall be unto you the stranger that sojourneth with you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the Lord your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Ye shall therefore observe all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them: I am the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
