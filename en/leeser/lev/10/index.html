as Moses had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, The hair of your head you shall not let grow long, and your garments you shall not rend, that ye die not, and that he be not wroth upon the whole congregation; but your brethren, the whole house of Israel, may bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall ye not go out, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you; and they did according to the word of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Wine or strong drink shalt thou not drink, neither thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So that ye may be able to distinguish between the holy and the unholy, and between the unclean and the clean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And that ye may be able to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar his sons, that were left, Take ye the meatoffering that is left of the fireofferings of the Lord, and eat it unleavened beside the altar; for it is most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy fixed portion, and the fixed portion of thy sons, from the fireofferings of the Lord; for so have I been commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the breast which hath been waved and the shoulder which hath been lifted up, shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for as thy fixed portion, and the fixed portion of thy sons, have they been given from the sacrifices of peaceofferings of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The shoulder which is waved and the breast which is lifted up, shall they bring with the fat of the fireoffering, to make therewith a waving before the Lord: and then shall it be thine, and thy sons with thee, as a fixed portion for ever; as the Lord hath commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the goat of the sinoffering Moses sought diligently, and behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Elazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who had been left, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore have ye not eaten the sinoffering in the holy place, seeing that it is most holy, and that he hath given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, its blood was not brought within the holy place: ye should then have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Aaron spoke unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sinoffering, and their burntoffering before the Lord; and things as these have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sinoffering today, would it have been pleasing in the eyes of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when Moses heard this, it was pleasing in his eyes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
