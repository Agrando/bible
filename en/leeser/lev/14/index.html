and if the priest see, and, behold, the plague of leprosy be healed on the leper:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two healthy, clean birds, and cedar wood, and a string of scarlet yarn, and hyssop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the string of scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, and he shall dip these and the living bird into the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times;

upon the place of the blood of the trespassoffering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And what is left of the oil that is in the priests hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, from what his means enable him to bring;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Even what his means enable him, the one for a sinoffering, and the other for a burntoffering, with the meatoffering: and the priest shall thus make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed, before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is the law of him on whom is the plague of leprosy, whose means are not sufficient when he is cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When ye come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy on a house of the land of your possession:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then shall he that owneth the house come and tell the priest, saying, Something like a leprosy hath shown itself to me in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the priest shall command that they clear out the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all be not made unclean that is in the house: and after this shall the priest go in to see the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he shall view the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house, in depressions, dark green or dark red, and their appearance be deeper than the wall:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then shall the priest go out of the house to the door of the house, and lock up the house seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the priest shall come again on the seventh day; and if he see, that, behold, the plague have spread in the walls of the house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then shall the priest command that they break out the stones on which the plague is; and they shall cast them forth without the city on an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the house he shall cause to be scraped within round about; and they shall pour out the rubbish that they have scraped off without the city on an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they shall take other stones, and put them into the place of these stones; and other mortar shall he take, and shall plaster the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after he hath taken away the stones, and after the house hath been scraped, and after it hath been plastered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then shall the priest come; and if he see that, behold, the plague have spread in the house, it is a corrosive leprosy in the house; it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he shall break down the house, its stones, and the timbers thereof, and all the mortar of the house;
