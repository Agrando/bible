and your sisters, Ruchamah That hath obtained mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; but let her put away her prostitution from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lest I strip her naked, and set her, as on the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and render her like a dry land, and let her die with thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And upon her children will I not have mercy; for they are children of prostitution;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will close it up with a fence, that she shall not find her paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she will make pursuit after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she will seek them, but shall not find them: then will she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for it was better with me then than now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But she indeed did not acknowledge, that it was I that had given her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied for her silver and gold, which they devoted for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore will I turn back, and take away my corn in its time, and my wine in its season, and I will snatch away my wool and my flax, given to cover her nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now will I lay open her disgrace before the eyes of her lovers, and no man shall deliver her out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will cause to cease all her mirth, her festival, her newmoon, and her sabbath, and all her appointed feasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make desolate her vine and her figtree, whereof she hath said, These are my reward which my lovers have given me: and I will change them into a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will visit upon her the days of the Bealim, to which she used to burn incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and me she forgot, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, will I allure her, and lead her forth into the wilderness, and I will speak comfortingly unto her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will give her again her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor sorrow as an entrance for hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as on the day of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall happen at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call me Ishi my husband, and shalt not call me any more Baali my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will remove the names of the Bealim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and bow, and sword, and war I will break away out of the land, and I will cause them to lie down in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever: yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will answer prayer, saith the Lord, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the earth shall answer the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Yizreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sow her for me in the land; and I will have mercy upon "Her that had not obtained mercy" Loruchamah; and I will say to those who were "Not my people" Loammi, Thou art my people: and they shall say, Thou art my God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
