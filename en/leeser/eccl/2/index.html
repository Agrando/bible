Then spoke I in my heart, that this is also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For there is no recollection of the wise any more than of the fool for ever: seeing that which hath long ago been will, in the days that are coming, all be forgotten. And how doth the wise die equally with the fool!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I hated life; because I felt displeased with the work that is wrought under the sun; for all is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, I hated also all my toil with which I had toiled under the sun; because I should have to leave it unto the man that will be after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knoweth, whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have full sway over all my toil wherein I have toiled, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. Also this is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to give up thinking of all the toil wherewith I had toiled under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there is many a man whose toil is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with energy; yet to a man that hath not toiled therefore must he give it as his portion. Also this is vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what doth a man obtain of all his toil, and of the torture of his heart, wherewith he toileth under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days are full of pains, and vexation is mingled with his employment: yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. Also this is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It is not a good thing inherent in man that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy happiness for his toil. Also this have I seen, that it cometh out of the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who can well eat, or who can enjoy earthly things more than I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For to a man who is good in his presence God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth employment, to gather up and to bring together, that he may give it to him that is good before God. Also this is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
