Also this is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because the punishment against evil deeds is not executed speedily, therefore is the heart of the sons of men filled up in them to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But let a sinner do evil a hundred times, and God withhold long his punishment from him; still do I truly know for certain that it will be well with those that fear God, because they are afraid of him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And that it will not be well with the wicked, and that he will not endure many days, like the shadow; because he is not afraid of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men, unto whom it happeneth in accordance with the deeds of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happeneth in accordance with the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore do I praise joyfulness, that there is nothing better for man under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful; for this will adhere to him in his toil, during the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the employment that is done upon the earth, how even neither by day nor by night sleep is seen in the eyes of some men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then did I see in the whole work of God, that a man is not able to find out the work that is done under the sun; inasmuch as though a man were to toil to seek for it, he would yet not find it; and even if the wise were to think to know it, he would yet not be able to find it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
