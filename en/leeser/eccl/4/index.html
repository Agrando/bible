Also this is vanity and a torture of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better is a handful of quiet, than both the hands full of toil and torture of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I turned about, and I saw a vanity under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There is one alone, and he hath not a companion; yea, he hath neither son nor brother: yet is there no end to all his toil; his eye also is not satisfied with riches. Yet for whom do I toil, and deprive my soul of good? Also this is vanity, yea, it is a bad employment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Two are better than one; because they will have a good reward for their toil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to the single one that falleth; for he hath no companion to lift him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Also, if two lie together, then will they become warm; but how can one person alone become warm?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a man could overpower him, the single one, two would stand up against him: and a threefold cord cannot quickly be torn asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Better is a poor and a wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to be admonished any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For out of the prison cometh the one to reign: whereas also in his kingdom the other becometh poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have seen all the living who walk under the sun, being with the second child that is to stand up in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There was no end to all the people, belonging to all that have been before them: they also that come after will not rejoice in him.
