Also this is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When prosperity increaseth, those that consume it likewise increase: and what advantage is there to its owner, saving to see it with his eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Sweet is the sleep of the laboring man, whether he eat little or much; but the overabundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches reserved for their owner to his own hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these riches are lost through an unfortunate event; and he begetteth a son, and hath not the least in his hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As he came forth out of his mothers womb, naked will he return to go as he came; and not the least will he carry off for his toil, which he might take away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And also this is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so must he go: and what profit hath he that hath toiled for the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All his days also had he to eat in darkness, and hath had much vexation and wrath with his sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, what I have truly seen as a good thing, that it is fitting to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all ones toil that he taketh under the sun the number of the days of his life, which God hath given him; for this is his portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also every man to whom God hath given riches and property, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his toil this is the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let him then remember, that the days of his life are not many, that God hath answered him with the joy of his heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
