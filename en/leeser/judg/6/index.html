But now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord turned toward him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: behold, I have sent thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto him, Pardon my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the weakest in Menasseh, and I am the youngest of my fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Lord said unto him, Because I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy eyes, then give me a sign that thou hast been speaking with me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thy return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Gidon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and the broth pour out. And he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Gidon perceived that it was an angel of the Lord, Gidon said, Alas, O Lord Eternal! because I have surely seen an angel of the Lord face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gidon built there an altar unto the Lord, and called it Adonayshalom the Eternal of Peace: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Take thy fathers young bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal which belongeth to thy father, and the grove that is around it shalt thou cut down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock, on the level place, and take the second bullock, and offer it as a burntsacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Gidon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had spoken unto him; but it came to pass, because he feared his fathers household, and the men of the city, to do it by day, that he did it by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was overthrown, and the grove that was around it was cut down, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar which had been built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And they inquired and searched, and then said, Gidon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thereupon said the men of the city unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die; because he hath overthrown the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was around it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Joash said unto all that stood around him, Will ye indeed contend for Baal? will ye assist him? he that will contend for him, shall be put to death; wait until morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath overthrown his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people called him on that day Yerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath overthrown his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the Midianites and Amalekites and the children of the east assembled together, and went over and encamped in the valley of Yizreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Spirit of the Lord endued Gidon, and he blew the cornet: and Abiezer assembled and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sent messengers throughout all Menasseh, who also assembled and followed him; and he sent messengers through Asher, and through Zebulun, and through Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Gidon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, I set up this fleece of wool in the threshing floor: if now there be dew on the fleece alone, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it was so; and when he rose up early on the morrow, he squeezed the fleece together, and wrung dew out of the fleece, making a bowl full of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gidon said unto God, Let not thy anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once more; let me have a proof, I pray thee, but this once more with the fleece; let it, I pray, be dry upon the fleece alone, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And God did so that night; and it was dry upon the fleece alone, and on all the ground there was dew.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
