and whence comest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlechemjudah toward the lower edge of the mountain of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went as far as Bethlechemjudah; but I am going to the house of the Lord; and there is no man that bringeth me into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there are also bread and wine for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man who is with thy servants; there is no want of any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the old man said, Peace be with thee; only let all thy wants lie upon me; at least lodge not in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he brought him to his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and they ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless people, beset the house round about, knocking at the door; and they said to the master of the house, the old man, thus, Bring forth the man that in come to thy house, that we may know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, No, my brethren, I pray you, act not wickedly; since this man is once come into my house, do not this scandalous thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; let me bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do to them what seemeth good in your eyes; but unto this man do not this scandalous thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men would not hearken to him; so the man took hold of his concubine, and brought her forth unto them into the street; and they knew her, and illused her all the night until the morning; and they let her go when the day began to dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came the woman home in the early part of the morning, and fell down at the door of the mans house where her lord was, and lay till it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go on his way: behold, the woman, his concubine, was lying at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto her, Rise up, and let us be going; but no one answered. Then he took her upon the ass, and the man rose up, and went unto his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, according to her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her about in all the territory of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it happened, that whoever saw it said, There hath no such deed been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day: reflect well on it, give advice, and speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
