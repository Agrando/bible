And she said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he tore the cords, as a thread of tow is torn when it toucheth the fire; and his strength was not perceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast deceived me, and told me lies; now do tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou canst be bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that have never been used in work, then shall I become weak, and be like any other of mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the liers in wait were sitting in the chamber. But he tore them from off his arms like a thread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast deceived me, and told me lies; do tell me wherewith thou canst be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awakened out of his sleep, and tore away the pin of the loom, with the web.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? these three times hast thou deceived me, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when she worried him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul became impatient to die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, A razor hath not passed over my head; for a Nazarite of God have I been from my mothers womb; if I were shaved, my strength would depart from me, and I should become weak, and be like all other men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once; for he hath told me all his heart. Then came the lords of the Philistines up unto her, and brought the money in their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called a man, and caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to subdue him, and his strength departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and thought, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself free. But he knew not that the Lord had departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Philistines seized him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gazzah, and bound him with fetters of copper; and he had to grind in the prisonhouse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the lords of the Philistines gathered themselves together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; and they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand Samson our enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, and him who hath slain so many of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when their heart was merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make sport for us. And they called for Samson out of the prisonhouse; and he made sport before them; and they placed him between the pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me to go and let me feel the pillars whereupon the house is supported, that I may lean upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now the house was full of men and women; and there were all the lords of the Philistines; and upon the roof were about three thousand men and women, that looked on while Samson made sport.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord Eternal, remember me, I pray thee, and do thou strengthen me only this once, O God, that I may be avenged for one of my two eyes on the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Samson threw his arms around the two middle pillars upon which the house was supported, and he leaned on them, on one with his right hand, and on the other with his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bent them with might, and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead whom he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain in his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then came down his brothers and all the house of his father, and they took him up, and carried him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the buryingplace of Manoach his father. And he had judged Israel twenty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
