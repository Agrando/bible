And Samson said unto his father, This one take for me; for she pleaseth me well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But his father and his mother knew not that it was from the Lord, that he sought but an occasion against the Philistines; and at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Samson thus went down, with his father and his mother, to Timnathah; and when they were come as far as the vineyards of Timnathah, behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly over him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand; but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he went down, and spoke unto the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he returned after a time to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the carcass of the lion and honey likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he took it out in his hands, and went on, eating as he was going, and came to his father and mother, and he gave unto them, and they did eat; but he told them not that out of the carcass of the lion he had taken the honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions, and they remained with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samson said unto them, I will now propound unto you a riddle; if ye can in anywise tell it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then will I give you thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if ye will not be able to tell it to me, then shall ye give me thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments. And they said unto him, Propound thy riddle, that we may hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not solve the riddle in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samsons wife, Persuade thy husband, that he may solve unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire: have ye invited us to impoverish us? is it not so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samsons wife wept before him, and said, Thou doest but hate me, and lovest me not: that riddle hast thou propounded unto the children of my people, and me hast thou not told the solution. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it to my father and to my mother, and thee shall I tell it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she had worried him: and she told the solution of the riddle to the children of her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said unto him the men of the city on the seventh day before the sun was yet gone down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly over him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew of them thirty men, and he took their apparel, and gave the changes of garments unto the expounders of the riddle; but his anger was kindled, and he went up to his fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samsons wife was given to his companion who had been given him as his associate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
