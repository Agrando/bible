And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and ten thousand remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Lord said unto Gidon, The people are yet too many; let them go down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I will say unto thee, This one shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee: and of whomsoever I will say unto thee, This one shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he caused the people to go down unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gidon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as the dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that bendeth down upon his knees to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the number of those that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bent down upon their knees to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord said unto Gidon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they took the provision of the people in their hand, and their cornets; and all the rest of Israel he dismissed, every man unto his tent; but those three hundred men he retained: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass, during the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if thou fear to go down, then go thou down with Purah thy servant to the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thou shalt hear what they will say; and after that shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou wilt go down unto the camp. And he went down with Purah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like the locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is by the seaside for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Gidon was come, behold, a man was telling a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream, and, lo, a baked cake of barley bread was rolling round through the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and struck against it so that it fell, and it turned it bottom upward, and the tent thus tumbled down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gidon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; into whose hand God hath delivered Midian, and the whole camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it was, when Gidon heard the narration of the dream, and its interpretation, that he prostrated himself, and returned unto the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the camp of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put cornets in the hand of all of them, with empty pitchers, and torches in the pitchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said unto them, What you see me do, do ye likewise; and, behold, when I am come to the edge of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I blow the cornet, I and all that are with me, then shall ye blow the cornets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For the Lord, and for Gidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Gidon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the edge of the camp in the bcginning of the middle watch; when they had but newly set the sentinels: and they blew the cornets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the three companies blew the cornets, and broke the pitchers, and seized with their left hand the torches, and with their right hand the cornets to blow; and they cried, The sword for the Lord, and for Gidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they remained standing every man in his place round about the camp; and all in the camp ran, and shouted, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as the three hundred cornets sounded, the Lord set every mans sword against his fellow, even throughout all the camp; and those in the camp fled as far as Bethhashittah to Zererah, up to the border of Abelmecholah, near Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Menasseh, and they pursued after the Midianites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gidon sent messengers throughout all the mountain of Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the waters as far as Bethbarah and the Jordan. And all the men of Ephraim assembled themselves, and seized on the waters as far as Bethbarah and the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued the Midianites; and the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they brought to Gidon from the other side of the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
