and why are ye come unto me now, when ye are in distress?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the elders of Gilad said unto Yiphthach, Therefore are we now come back to thee, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon; and thou shalt become unto us a head, unto all the inhabitants of Gilad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yiphthach said unto the elders of Gilad, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the Lord give them up before me, shall I remain your head?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the elders of Gilad said unto Yiphthach, The Lord shall be a hearer between us, if we do not so according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then went Yiphthach with the elders of Gilad, and the people appointed him over them as head and as leader; and Yiphthach spoke all his words before the Lord in Mitzpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Yiphthach sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have I to do with thee, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king of the children of Ammon said unto the messengers of Yiphthach, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Yabbok, and unto the Jordan: and now restore these lands again in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yiphthach again sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto him, Thus hath said Yiphthach, Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For when they came up out of Egypt, Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Israel then sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me pass, I pray thee, through thy land; but the king of Edom would not hearken; and also to the king of Moab they sent; but he would not consent: and Israel remained in Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they wandered through the wilderness, and traveled round the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came from the rising of the sun to the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon: but they came not within the border of Moab; for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Israel sent messengers unto Sichon the king of the Emorites, the king of Cheshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Sichon trusted not Israel to let them pass through his territory; and Sichon assembled all his people, and encamped in Yahaz, and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the Lord the God of Israel delivered Sichon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them; and Israel took possession of all the land of the Emorites, the inhabitants of that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they took possession of all the territory of the Emorites, from the Arnon even unto the Yabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So now the Lord the God of Israel hath dispossessed the Emorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou possess it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly! that which Kemosh thy god may give thee to possess, even that canst thou possess; but whatsoever the Lord our God hath driven out from before us, even that will we possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now art thou then any better than Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And while Israel hath dwelt in Cheshbon and in its towns, and in Aror and in its towns, and in all the cities that are along the margins of the Arnon, three hundred years: why did ye not recover them within that time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whereas I myself have not sinned against thee, and thou doest me wrong to war against me: may the Lord, the Judge, decide this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nevertheless the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Yiphthach which he had sent to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then came upon Yiphthach the spirit of the Lord, and he passed through Gilad and Menasseh, and passed through Mitzpeh of Gilad, and from Mitzpeh of Gilad he passed over unto the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Yiphthach made a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then shall it be, that whatsoever cometh forth out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall belong to the Lord, and I will offer it up for a burntoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Yiphthach passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them: and the Lord delivered them into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou comest to Minnith, twenty cities, and unto Abelkeramin, with a very great defeat; and the children of Ammon were humbled before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Yiphthach came to Mizpah unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his sole child; he had beside her neither son nor daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his garments, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast bent me down very low, and thou art one of those that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord, do to me in accordance with what hath proceeded out of thy mouth; since the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee on thy enemies, on the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may descend to the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I with my companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he aid, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, and he fulfilled on her his vow which he had vowed; and she knew no man; and it became a custom in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That the daughters of Israel went from year to year to lament for the daughter of Yiphthach the Giladite four days in the year.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
