For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will receive me kindly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The present went thus on before him; and he lodged himself that night in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he rose up that night, and he took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Yabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took them, and sent them over the stream and sent over what he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he saw that he could net prevail against him, he struck against the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacobs thigh was put out of joint, as he was wrestling with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Let me go, for the day hath dawned. And he said, I will not let thee go until thou hast blessed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said unto him, What is thy name? and he said, Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Not Jacob shall any more be called thy name, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob asked him, and said, tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen an angel of God face to face, and my life hath been preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sun rose unto him as he passed by Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore do the children of Israel not eat the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he struck against the hollow of Jacobs thigh on the sinew that shrank.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
