And Isaac said unto him, Because I thought, Perhaps I may die for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? How easily might one of the people have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold: so the Lord blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the man became great, and went forward and grew, until he became very great;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants; and the Philistines envied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And all the wells which his fathers servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, these the Philistines stopped, and filled them with earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go away from us; for thou hast become much mightier than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaacs herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Essek; because they strove with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they dug another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he removed from there, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rechoboth, and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall increase in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from there to Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for the sake of Abraham my servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he built there an altar, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched there his tent: and the servants of Isaac dug there a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Achuzzath his friend, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing that ye do hate me, and have sent me away from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with thee; and we said, Let there be now an oath between us and thee; and we will make a covenant with thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That thou shalt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now one blessed of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they rose up betimes in the morning, and they swore one to the other; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass the same day, that Isaacs servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and they said unto him, We have found water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he called it Shibah: therefore is the name of the city Beersheba unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri, the Hittite, and Bahsemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
