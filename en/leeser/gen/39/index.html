And Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass after these things, that his masters wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he refused, and said unto his masters wife, Behold, Thy master troubleth himself not about what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath into my hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, and he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That it came to pass one particular day, that he went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me; and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and ran out into the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in unto us a Hebrew man to have his sport with us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and ran out into the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to have his sport with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner hath thy servant done to me; that his wrath was kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Josephs master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the kings prisoners were imprisoned: and he was there in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the Lord was with Joseph, and caused him to find kindness, and gave him favor in the eyes of the superintendent of the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the superintendent of the prison committed into Josephs hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, was done through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The superintendent of the prison looked not after the least that was under his hand, because the Lord was with him; and that which he did, the Lord made to prosper.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
