for he hath sold us; and he hath quite consumed also our money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our childrens; now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he led away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his acquiring, which he had gotten in Padanaram, to go to Isaac his father into the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban was gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the images that were her fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, by not letting him know that he was going to flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it was told to Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him a seven days journey; and he overtook him at the mount of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Laban overtook Jacob; now Jacob had pitched his tent on the mount, and Laban with his brethren pitched on the mount of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and led away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and why didst thou not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why hast thou not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now thou hast acted foolishly in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now, thou wouldst needs be gone, because thou greatly longedst after thy fathers house; yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Peradventure thou wouldst take by force thy daughters from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live; before our brethren seek out thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee; but Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and into the tent of Leah, and into the tent of the two maidservants; but he found nothing; he then went out of the tent of Leah, and entered into Rachels tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the saddlecushion of the camel, and sat upon them; and Laban searched all the tent, and found nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me; and thus he searched, but found not the images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now Jacob became wroth, and quarrelled with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Although thou hast searched all my goods, what hast thou found of all the articles of thy household? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge between us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young; and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I had to bear the loss of it, of my hand didst thou require it, whatever was stolen by day, or stolen by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Where I was in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These twenty years have I been in thy house; I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flocks: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty; my affliction and the labor of my hands God hath seen, and decided yesternight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine; but as to my daughters, what can I do unto them this day, or unto their children whom they have born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And now, come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there upon the heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Laban called it Yegarsahadutha; but Jacob called it Galed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day; therefore called he its name Galed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Mitzpah; for he said, The Lord shall watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from the other;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If thou shouldst afflict my daughters, or if thou shouldst take other wives besides my daughters, when there is no man with us: see, God is witness between me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast up between me and thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Witness be this heap and witness be this pillar, that I will not pass by this heap, and that thou shalt not pass unto me by this heap and this pillar, for evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The God of Abraham and the God of Nachor shall judge between us, the God of their father; but Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then Jacob slew some cattle upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night on the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them; and Laban departed, and returned unto his own place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
