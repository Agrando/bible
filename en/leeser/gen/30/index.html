And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me the least; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted lamb, and every brown lamb among the sheep, and whatever is spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be after this my reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And my righteousness shall testify for me in time to come, when it shall come with my reward before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Laban said, Well, let it be according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he removed on that day the hegoats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the shegoats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white on it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he put a space of three days journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the flocks of Laban that were left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jacob took himself rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and peeled thereon white streaks, laying bare the white which was on the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he set the rods which he had peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink, just before the flocks, and where they conceived, when they came to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And these lambs did Jacob separate, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked, and whatever was brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Labans cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in; so the feebler belonged to Laban, and the stronger to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the man increased exceedingly, and he had many flocks, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
