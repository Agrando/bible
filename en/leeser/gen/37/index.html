Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers; and he was as a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his fathers wives; and Joseph brought evil reports of them unto his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers: and they hated him yet the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also remained standing upright; and, behold, your sheaves placed themselves round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his brothers said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers; and he said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he told it to his father, and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother, and thy brothers, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his brothers envied him; but his father noted the matter in his mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his brothers went to feed their fathers flocks in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brothers feed the flocks in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brothers, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering astray in the field; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I seek my brothers; tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding their flocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said one to another, Behold, here comes this man of dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, come and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hand; and he said, Let us not put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben said unto them, Do not shed blood; but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hand upon him; in order that he might deliver him out of their hand, to bring him back again to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brothers, that they stript Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they took him, and cast him into the pit; and the pit was empty; there was no water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead; and their camels were bearing spicery, and balm, and lotus, going to carry it down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah said unto his brothers, What profit will it be if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but let our hand not be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers hearkened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when the Midianitish men, merchants, passed by, they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when Reuben returned unto the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he returned unto his brothers, and said, The child is not there; and I, whither shall I go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they took Josephs coat, and killed a hegoat, and dipped the coat in the blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: acknowledge, we pray thee, whether it be thy sons coat or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he recognized it, and said, it is my sons coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is surely torn in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I must go down unto my son, mourning, into the grave; thus his father wept for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaohs, the captain of the guards.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
