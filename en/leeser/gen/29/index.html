And they said, Of Charan are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nachor? And they said, We know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well; and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, Lo, the day is yet long, it is not time that the cattle should be driven home; water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, then do they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; and we water the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her fathers sheep; for she was a shepherdess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mothers brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers brother, and that he was Rebekahs son: and she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sisters son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Laban then said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldst thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall thy wages be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the eyes of Leah were tender; but Rachel was of handsome form and handsome appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob served for Rachel seven years; and they seemed unto him but a few days, through the love he had to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid for a handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou deceived me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said, It is not done so in our place, to give in marriage the younger before the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfill the week of this, and we will give thee this one also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled the week of the first; and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah; and he served with him yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Surely, the Lord hath looked upon my affliction, because now my husband will love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again and bore a son; and she said, Because the Lord heard that I was hated, he hath given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons; therefore was his name called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said, This time will I praise the Lord; therefore she called his name Judah: and she left off bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
