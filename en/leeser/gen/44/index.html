And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were gone out of the city, not yet far off, when Joseph said unto the superintendent of his house, Up, follow after the men; and when thou hast overtaken them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye returned evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not this out of which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said unto him, Wherefore will my lord speak such words as these? God forbid that thy servants should do any thing like this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold the money, which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die; and we also will be bondmen unto thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; but ye shall be blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they made haste, and every one of them took down his sack to the ground, and every one opened his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched, at the eldest he began, and at the youngest he left off; and the cup was found in Benjamins sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they rent their clothes, and every one loaded his ass, and they returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brothers came into Josephs house, and he was yet there; and they fell down before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we justify ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are servants unto my lord, both we, as also he in whose hand the cup was found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, God forbid that I should do this: the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go you up in peace unto your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Pardon, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lords ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said unto my lord, We have an old father, and a little child born in his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set my eye upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, he would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall not see my face any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when we came up unto thy servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go back and buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the mans face, except our youngest brother be with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he hath been torn to pieces; and I have not seen him up to this time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It will come to pass, that when he seeth that the lad is not with us, he will die: and thy servants would thus bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I have sinned against my father all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad as bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? I should perhaps be compelled to witness the evil which would come on my father.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
