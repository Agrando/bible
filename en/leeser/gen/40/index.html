And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it to me, I pray you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The chief of the butlers then told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, shot forth its blossoms, and on its clusters the grapes became ripe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Pharaohs cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them out into Pharaohs cup, and I placed the cup into Pharaohs hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph said unto him, This is its interpretation: The three branches are three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Within yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thy office; and thou shalt place Pharaohs cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore if thou thinkest on me when it shall be well with thee, then show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I not done the least that they should put me into the dungeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the chief of the bakers saw that he had well interpreted, he said unto Joseph, I also saw in my dream, and, behold, I had three baskets with fine bread on my head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats, used as food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket from my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Within yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and will hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief of the butlers and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he restored the chief of the butlers unto his butlership; and he placed the cup in Pharaohs hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the chief of the bakers he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet the chief of the butlers did not remember Joseph, and forgot him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
