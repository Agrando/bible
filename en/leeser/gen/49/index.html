and hearken unto Israel your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power should be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Unstable as water, thou shalt not have the excellence; because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed; then defiledst thou the one who ascended my couch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Simeon and Levi are brethren; weapons of violence are their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Into their secret shall my soul not come; unto their assembly my spirit shall not be united; for in their anger they slew the man, and in their selfwill they lamed the ox.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Judah, thou art the one thy brothers shall praise, thy hand shall be on the neck of thy enemies; thy fathers children shall bow down unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Like a lions whelp, O Judah, from the prey, my son, thou risest: he stoopeth down, he croucheth as a lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet; until Shiloh come, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He bindeth unto the vine his foal, and to the vinebranch his asss colt; he washeth his garments in wine, and in the blood of grapes his clothes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes shall be red from wine, and his teeth white from milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Zebulun shall dwell at the margin of the seas; and he shall be at the haven of ships; and his border shall be near to Zidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Issachar is a strongboned ass, couching down between the stables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he saw the restingplace that it was good, and the land that it was pleasant, he bent his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder on the path, that biteth the horse in the heels, so that his rider falleth backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thy salvation, I hope, O Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Gad, troops will band against him; but he shall wound their heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Out of Asher cometh fat bread, and he shall yield royal dainties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Naphtali is like a fleet hind; he bringeth pleasant words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; the branches of which run over the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they embittered his life, and they shot at him, and they hated him, the men of the arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But his bow abode in strength, and his arm and his hands remained firm; from the hands of the mighty God of Jacob, from there thou becamest the shepherd, the stone of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>From the God of thy father, who will help thee; and from the Almighty, who will bless thee, with blessings of heaven above, with blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, with blessings of the breasts, and of the womb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the blessings of thy father that have excelled the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: these shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separated from his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Benjamin shall be as a wolf that rendeth: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at evening he shall divide the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve in number; and this is what their father spoke unto them, and wherewith he blessed them; every one according to his proper blessing blessed he them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he charged them and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people; bury me near my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which field Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite, for a possession as a buryingplace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>(There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Purchasing the field and the cave that is therein from the children of Heth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed; and he departed this life, and was gathered unto his people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
