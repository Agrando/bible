And Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And many days had elapsed when the daughter of Shua, Judahs wife, died; and after Judah was comforted, he went up unto his sheepshearers, he and his friend Chirah the Adullamite, to Timnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was told unto Tamar, saying, Behold, thy fatherinlaw goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she put her widows garments off from her, and covered herself with a vail, and concealed her face, and seated herself at the crossroad, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him for wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Judah saw her and thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; for he knew not that she was his daughterinlaw. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, If thou wilt give me a pledge, till thou send it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, What is the pledge which I shall give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy scarf, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them unto her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to take the pledge out of the womans hand; but he found her not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was at the crossroad on the highway? And they said, There hath been no harlot in this neighborhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place have said, There hath been no harlot in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah said, Let her keep it, lest we be put to shame; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughterinlaw hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by prostitution. And Judah said, Lead her forth, and let her be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When she was led forth, she sent to her fatherinlaw, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, to whom belong these, the signet, the scarf, and staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her not again any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass at the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth! this breach is upon thee: therefore his name was called Perez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerach.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
