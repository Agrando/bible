And I, if I am to be bereaved, let me be bereaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men took that present; and twofold money they took in their hand, as also Benjamin; and they rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the superintendent of his house, Bring these men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for with me shall these men dine at noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man did as Joseph had said; and the man brought the men into Josephs house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Josephs house: and they said, Because of the money that came back in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, together with our asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they came near to the man who was appointed over Josephs house, and they spoke with him at the door of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they said, Pardon, my lord, we came down at the first time to buy food:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every mans money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we know not who hath put our money in our sacks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, hath given you a treasure in your sacks; your money hath come to me. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the man brought the men into Josephs house; and he gave them water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they made ready the present before Joseph came home at noon; for they had heard that they should eat bread there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he asked them after their welfare, and said, Is your old father well, of whom ye spoke? is he yet alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered, Thy servant, our father, is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and prostrated themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mothers son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spoke unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Joseph hastened away, for his affection toward his brother became enkindled, and he sought to weep; and he entered into his chamber and wept there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he washed his face, and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves; and for the Egyptians, who did eat with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians may not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his prior birth, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marveled one at the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he sent portions unto them from before him; but Benjamins portion exceeded the portions of all of them fivefold. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
