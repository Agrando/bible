and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Abraham said unto his servant, the eldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But unto my country, and to my birthplace shalt thou go, and take a wife unto my son, unto Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I then bring thy son again unto the land from which thou camest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou, that thou bring not my son thither again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my fathers house, and from the land of my birth, and who spoke unto me, and who swore unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if the woman should not be willing to follow thee, then shalt, thou be clear from this my oath: only my son thou shalt not bring thither again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed, with all kinds of precious things of his master in his hand; and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nachor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, at the time that the women go out to draw water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and deal kindly with my master Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, I stand by the well of water: and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And let it come to pass that the maiden to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and to thy camels also will I give drink, be the one thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shown kindness unto my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, before he had yet finished speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nachor, Abrahams brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the maiden was of a very handsome appearance, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water out of thy pitcher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Drink, my lord; and she hastened, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, Also for thy camels will I draw water, until they have finished drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she hastened, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man was wondering at her; remaining silent, to discover whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden earring, half a shekel in weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten gold shekels in weight;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee; is there room in thy fathers house for us to stay this night in?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore unto Nachor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender in plenty, as also room to lodge in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the man bowed down his head, and prostrated himself before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not withdrawn his mercy and his truth from my master; I being on the way, which the Lord hath led me, to the house of the brethren of my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the maiden ran, and told at her mothers house these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this came to pass, when he saw the earring and the bracelets upon his sisters hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man unto me; and he came unto the man; and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou without? while I have prepared the house and room for the camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there was set food before him to eat; but he said, I will not eat, until I have spoken my words. And he said, Speak on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I am Abrahams servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Sarah my masters wife bore a son to my master after she was become old: and he hath given unto him all that he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But thou shalt go unto my fathers house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I have walked will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; that thou mayest take a wife for my son from my kindred, and from my fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they do not give thee one, then shalt thou be clear from my oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if thou wouldst but prosper my way on which I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall be the young woman who cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water out of thy pitcher to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And she say to me, Both drink thou, and also for thy camels will I draw: this shall be the wife whom the Lord hath destined for my masters son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And before I had yet finished speaking to my own heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water; and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and also to thy camels I will give drink; and I drank, and she made the camels drink also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nachors son, whom Milcah bore unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And I bowed down my head, and prostrated myself before the Lord; and I blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take the daughter of my masters brother for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right, or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing hath proceeded from the Lord; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be the wife of thy masters son, as the Lord hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And it came to pass, when Abrahams servant heard their words, that he prostrated himself to the earth unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the servant brought forth vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; and precious things he gave to her brother and to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried the night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her brother and her mother said, Let the maiden abide with us, a year or ten months; after that she shall go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they said, We will call the maiden, and inquire her own decision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And thereupon they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abrahams servant, and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of myriads, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Rebekah arose with her maidens, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man; and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Isaac came from a walk to the well Lachairoi; for he dwelt in the south country;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Isaac was gone out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, camels were coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and she saw Isaac; and she alighted off the camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And she said unto the servant, Who is yonder man that walketh in the field toward us? And the servant said, This is my master; therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mothers death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
