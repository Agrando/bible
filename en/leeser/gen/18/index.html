And they said, So do, as thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man, and he hastened to dress it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took cream and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife! And he said, Behold, in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I will certainly return unto thee at this time next year: and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it at the door of the tent, which was behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in years; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord also being old!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, since I am old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, at this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid; but he said, Nay; indeed thou didst laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the men rose up from there and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, that they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice; in order that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord said, Because the cry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will go down now, and see if they have done according to the cry against them, which is come unto me, destruction shall come upon them; and if not, I will know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou then destroy the righteous also with the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then also destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are therein?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Far be it from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be this from thee; shall the Judge of all the earth not exercise justice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then will I spare all of the place for their sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, although I am but dust and ashes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous; wilt thou then destroy all the city for the lack of these five? And he said, I will not destroy, if I find there forty and five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke yet again unto him, and said, Peradventure there will be found there forty. And he said, I will not do it for the sake of the forty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will be found there thirty. And he said, I will not do it, if I find there thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there will be found there twenty. And he said, I will not destroy for the sake of the twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure there will be found there ten. And he said, I will not destroy, for the sake of the ten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Lord went away, when he had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
