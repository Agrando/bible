but the righteous are like the confident young lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When there is transgression in a land, it hath many for its princes; but under a man of understanding and knowledge its prosperity will long continue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A poor man that oppresseth the indigent is like a sweeping rain which bringeth no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They that forsake the law praise the wicked; but such as observe the law contend with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Bad men understand not justice; but they that seek the Lord understand all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whoso keepeth the law is an intelligent son; but he that is a companion of gluttons bringeth dishonor on his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that increaseth his wealth by interest and usury will gather it for him that will be kind to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When one turneth away his ear so as not to listen to the law, even his prayer becometh an abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whoso causeth the upright to go astray on an evil way, will surely fall into his own ditch; but the men of integrity will inherit what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the indigent that hath understanding can search him through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the righteous exult, there is great splendor; but when the wicked rise up, a man hath to be sought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He that concealeth his transgressions will not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them will obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Happy is the man that always dreadeth to do evil; but he that hardeneth his heart will fall into unhappiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As a roaring lion, and a greedy bear, so is a wicked ruler over an indigent people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The prince that is void of understanding is also a great oppressor; but he that hateth unjust gain will prolong his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A man oppressed by the load of having shed human blood will flee even to the pit: let no man hold him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoso walketh in integrity will be saved; but he that walketh perversely on two paths, will fall on one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He that tilleth his ground will have plenty of bread; but he that runneth after idle persons will have enough of poverty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A faithful man will abound with blessings; but he that maketh haste to be rich will not go unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To have respect to persons is not good; because even for a piece of bread will a man transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He that is eager for wealth is a man of an evil eye, and he knoweth not that want will come upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that reproveth a man after my example will obtain more grace than he that flattereth with the tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, it is no transgression,the same is a companion of a destroyer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He that hath an insatiable desire stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the Lord will be abundantly gratified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He that trusteth in his own sense is a fool; but whoso walketh in wisdom, will ever escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He that giveth unto the poor will not have any want; but he that hideth his eyes will have an abundance of curses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When the wicked rise, men conceal themselves; but when they perish, the righteous increase.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
