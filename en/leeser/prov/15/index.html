but a mortifying word stirreth up anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge acceptable; but the mouth of fools sputtereth out folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In every place are the eyes of the Lord, looking on the bad and the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A healing word of the tongue is a tree of life; but perverseness therein is a breach to the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A fool contemneth the correction of his father; but he that observeth admonition will become prudent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the house of the righteous there is much treasure; but in the income of the wicked is trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lips of the wise scatter knowledge; but the heart of fools is not reliable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord: but, the prayer of the upright obtaineth his favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>An abomination of the Lord is the way of the wicked; but him that pursueth righteousness will he love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>An evil correction is destined for him that forsaketh the right path; he that hateth admonition will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The nether world and corruption are open before the Lord: how much more then the hearts of the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A scorner loveth not that one should admonish him: unto the wise doth he not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A merry heart cheereth up the countenance; but when the heart feeleth pain the spirit is depressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The heart of the man of understanding seeketh knowledge; but the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All the days of the afflicted are evil; but he that is of a cheerful heart hath a continual feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and confusion therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Better is an allowance of herbs when love is there, than a stallfed ox and hatred therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A man of fury stirreth up strife; but he that is slow to anger assuageth contention.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of the slothful man is like a hedge of thorns; but the path of the upright is a levelled road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A wise son causeth his father to rejoice; but a foolish man despiseth his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Folly is joy to him that is void of sense; but a man of understanding walketh straight forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Plans are frustrated without consultation; but through a multitude of counsellors canst thou maintain thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth; and a word spoken at the proper time, how good is it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The path of life leadeth upward for the intelligent, in order that he may avoid the nether world beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Lord, will tear down the house of the proud; but he will set up firmly the boundarystone of the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>An abomination of the Lord are the thoughts of the bad man; but pleasant speeches are pure before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He that is greedy after gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The heart of the righteous reflecteth to answer; but the mouth of the wicked sputtereth out evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Lord is far from the wicked; but the prayer of the righteous doth he hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What is pleasant to the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: a good report giveth marrow to the bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The ear that heareth the admonition of life will ever abide in the midst of the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that rejecteth correction despiseth his own soul; but he that heareth admonition acquireth intelligence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The fear of the Lord is the correction for wisdom; and before honor there must come humility.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
