but a full weight obtaineth his favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When pride cometh, then cometh disgrace; but with the modest there is wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The integrity of the upright guideth them; but the cunning of the treacherous destroyeth them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wealth cannot profit on the day of wrath; but righteousness deliver from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The righteousness of the perfect maketh even his way; but by his own wickedness will the wicked fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The righteousness of the upright will deliver them; but through their own sinful desires are the treacherous caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When a wicked man dieth, his hope vanisheth; and the expectation of his children is lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The righteous is delivered out of distress, and the wicked cometh in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With his mouth doth the hypocrite destroy his neighbor; but through knowledge are the righteous delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When it goeth well with the righteous, the town rejoiceth loudly: and when the wicked perish, there is joyful shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted; but through the mouth of the wicked it is pulled down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that despiseth his neighbor is void of sense; but a man of understanding maintaineth silence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He that walketh about as talebearer revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Where there is no wise guidance, a people must fall: but it will obtain help through the multitude of counsellors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>With evil will he be overwhelmed that is surety for a stranger: but he that hateth giving the hand as pledge is safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A woman endowed with grace will surely obtain honor; and the powerful will obtain riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The man of kindness doth good to his own soul; but he that troubleth his own flesh is cruel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The wicked practiseth a work of falsehood; but he that soweth righteousness obtaineth the reward of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He who is firm in righteousness attaineth to life: and he that pursueth evil doth it to his own death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>An abomination of the Lord are those of a perverse heart; but his favor is for those who are unblemished in their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The hand of God being against his hand, the bad man shall not go unpunished; but the seed of the righteous shall escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As a golden ring in a swineÂ’s snout, so is a handsome woman that hath thrown off discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The desire of the righteous is only good: but the hope of the wicked is the wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is a man that scattereth gifts, and yet his wealth is increased: and there is one that withholdeth more than is proper, and still cometh only to want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>A beneficent soul will be abundantly gratified; and he that refresheth others will be also refreshed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Him that withholdeth corn, the people will denounce; but blessing will be heaped upon the head of the one that selleth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He that diligently searcheth after good seeketh favor; but if one inquireth after evil, it will come unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He that trusteth in his riches will surely fall; but the righteous shall grow like the leaves of a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that troubleth his own house will inherit the wind; and the fool will become the servant to the wise of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The fruit of the righteous is of the tree of life, and the wise draweth souls to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the righteous is recompensed on the earth: how much more the wicked and the sinner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
