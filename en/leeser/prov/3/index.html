bind them about thy throat; write them upon the table of thy heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So shalt thou find grace and good favor in the eyes of God and man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust in the Lord with all thy heart: and upon thy own understanding do not rely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make level thy paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It will be healing to thy body, and marrow to thy bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honor the Lord with thy wealth, and with the firstfruits of all thy products:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So shall thy storehouses be filled with plenty, and with new wine shall thy presses overflow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The correction of the Lord, my son, do not despise; and feel no loathing for his admonition;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because whomever the Lord loveth he admonisheth; and as a father who delighteth in his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Happy the man that hath found wisdom, and the man that acquireth understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the obtaining of her is better than the obtaining of silver, and better than fine gold is her product.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She is more precious than pearls; and all the things thou valuest are not equal unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Length of days is in her right hand: in her left are riches and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A tree of life is she to those that lay hold on her: and every one that firmly graspeth her will be made happy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord hath through wisdom founded the earth: he hath established the heavens through understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By his knowledge were the depths split open, and the skies drop down the dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, let them not be removed from thy eyes; keep before thee sound wisdom and discretion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they will be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy throat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then wilt thou walk in safety on thy way, and thy foot will not strike against aught:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When thou layest thyself down, thou shalt feel no dread; and as thou liest down, thy sleep shall be pleasant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou needest not to be afraid of sudden dread, neither of the unlookedfor tempest over the wicked, when it cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the Lord will be thy confidence, and he will guard thy foot from being caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Withhold not a benefit from him who is deserving it, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and return, and tomorrow will I give: when thou hast it by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Contrive not against thy neighbor any evil, when he dwelleth in safety with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Quarrel not with any man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Envy not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the froward is an abomination to the Lord; but with the upright is his goodwill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked; but the habitation of the righteous will he bless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If it concern the scornful he will himself render them a scorn; but unto the lowly doth he give grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The wise shall inherit glory; but fools shall obtain disgrace as their portion.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
