but the Lord weigheth the hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>To exercise righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Haughtiness of the eyes, and an immoderate heart, are the sinful field of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The plans of the diligent tend only to plenty; but every hasty man is destined only to want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The getting of treasures by a tongue of falsehood is like the fleeting breath of those that seek death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The robbery of the wicked will drag them away; because they refuse to execute justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Perverse is the way of the man that is estranged from goodness; but as for the pure, his work is upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It is better to dwell in a corner of a roof, than with a quarrelsome woman in a roomy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The soul of the wicked longeth for evil: his neighbor findeth no grace in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is taught intelligence, he receiveth knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The righteous regardeth attentively the house of the wicked; but God overturneth the wicked into unhappiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whoso stoppeth his ears against the cry of the poor, he also will cry himself, but shall not be answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A gift in secret pacifieth anger, and a bribe in the bosom, strong fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It is joy to the righteous to execute justice; but it is a terror to wrongdoers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The man that wandereth astray out of the way of intelligence shall rest in the assembly of the departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He that loveth pleasure will be a man of want: he that loveth wine and oil will not become rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the treacherous shall be put in the stead of the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a quarrelsome and vexatious woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There are a desirable treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man will swallow it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He that pursueth righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength in which they trusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoso guardeth his mouth and his tongue guardeth his soul against distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The presumptuous and proud, scorner is his name, dealeth in the wrath of presumption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The longing of the slothful will kill him; for his hands refuse to labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day he feeleth a great longing; but the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a sinful purpose?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A lying witness shall perish; but the man that is obedient to the law can speak for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A wicked man showeth impudence in his face; but as for the upright, he will consider well his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The horse is prepared for the day of battle;
