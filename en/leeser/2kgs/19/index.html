open, O Lord, thy eyes, and see! and hear the words of Sennacherib, that which he hath sent to blaspheme the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they have placed their gods into the fire; for they are no gods, but the work of mans hands, wood and stone: and these have they destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now, O Lord our God, save us, I beseech thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God, thou alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then sent Isaiah the son of Amoz to Hezekiah, saying, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, What thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib the king of Assyria have I heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the word that the Lord hath spoken over him: She despiseth thee, she laugheth thee to scorn, the virgin daughter of Zion; behind thee shaketh her head the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whom hast thou blasphemed, and whom hast thou scorned? and against whom hast thou raised thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By thy messengers thou hast blasphemed the Lord and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I indeed come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and I will cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its firtrees: and I will enter into the lodgings on its summit, the forest of its fruitful soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have dug and drunk strange waters, and I will dry up with the sole of my feet all the streams of besieged places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hadst thou not heard that in distant ages I had prepared this? in the times of antiquity when I formed it? now have I brought it along, and it came to pass, to desolate into ruinous heaps fortified cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And thus their inhabitants were short of power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the herbs of the field, and as the green grass; as the moss on the housetops, and as corn blasted before the ear appeareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But thy abiding and thy going out and thy coming in do I know, and thy raging against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because of thy raging against me and thy tumult that is come up into my ears, will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle between thy lips; and I will cause thee to turn back on the way by which thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this shall be unto thee the sign, Ye shall eat this year what groweth of itself, and in the second year what springeth up after the same; and in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the remnant of the house of Judah that is escaped shall yet again strike root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and that which escapeth out of mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow thereon, nor come before it with shield, nor cast up against it an embankment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>On the way by which he came, by the same shall he return, and into this city shall he not come, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I will shield this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, on the same night, that an angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred eighty and five thousand men: and when people arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Sennacherib the king of Assyria then departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, as he was prostrating himself in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Essarchaddon his son became king in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
