Because the Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast indeed dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And not one doth so who hath a remnant of a good spirit; for what desireth such a one? he seeketh to possess a godly posterity: therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none of you deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he hateth putting away the wife, so hath said the Lord the God of Israel, and him who covereth his garment with violence, so hath said the Lord of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, and deal not treacherously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye have wearied the Lord with your words: yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? By your saying, Every one that doth evil is good in the eyes of the Lord, and in them he findeth delight; or else, Where is the God of justice!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
