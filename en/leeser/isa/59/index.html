neither his ear too heavy for hearing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But your iniquities have ever made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have caused him to hide his face from you, so that he would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity: your lips have spoken falsehood, your tongue uttereth deception.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>No one admonisheth with righteousness, and no one executeth justice in truth; men trust in naught, and speak lies; they have conceived mischief, and bring forth wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Basilisks eggs do they hatch, and spiders webs do they weave: he that eateth of their eggs must die, and if one be crushed, a viper will break forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Their webs cannot serve for garments, and they cannot clothe themselves with their works: their works are works of wickedness, and the deed of violence is in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their feet run to what is evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness; wasting and destruction are on their highways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice on their tracks: their paths they have made unto themselves crooked; whosoever walketh therein knoweth not peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore is justice far from us, nor will happiness overtake us: we ever hope for light, but behold there is darkness; for brightness, but in obscurity must we walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We grope like the blind on the wall, and as if we had no eyes do we grope: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; we are in complete darkness like the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We growl all of us like bears, and like doves do we moan sorely; we ever hope for justice, but there is none; for aid, but it is far from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our transgressions are numerous in thy presence, and our sins testify against us; for of our transgressions are we aware; and our iniquitieswe know them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We transgressed and denied the Lord, and departed away from our God; we spoke oppression and revolt, conceived and brought forth in our heart words of falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And justice is forced to turn backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth stumbled in the street, and equity is not able to enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thus is the truth missing; and he that departeth from evil is regarded as foolish: and the Lord saw it, and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought him aid, and his righteousness,yea, this sustained him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and placed the helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance as raiment, and wrapped himself with zeal as with a cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to the demerits, so will he repay all, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands will he repay what they have merited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they shall fear from the west the name of the Lord, and from the rising of the sun his glory; for there shall come distress like the stream which the Spirit of the Lord urgeth forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But unto Zion shall come the redeemer, and unto those who return from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord, My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy children, nor out of the mouth of thy childrens children, saith the Lord, from henceforth and unto all eternity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
