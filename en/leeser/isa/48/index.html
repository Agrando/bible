I caused thee to hear new things, from this time, even hidden things which thou hadst not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now are they created, and not from the beginning; and before the day that I announced them thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But neither hadst thou heard it; nor didst thou know; nor had in ancient times thy ear been opened; for I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously, and a transgressor wast thou called from thy birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the sake of my name will I defer my anger, and because of my praise will I restrain it toward thee, so that I may not cut thee off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined thee, though not into silver: I have approved thee in the crucible of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my own sake will I do it: for how would my name be dishonored? and my glory will I not give unto another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel, my called one; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned out the heavens: I call unto them, they stand forward together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear: Who among them hath told these things? He whom the Lord loveth, will do his pleasure on Babylon, and display his arm on the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have spoken it, I have also called him: I have brought him, and he shall be prosperous on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; never from the beginning have I spoken in secret; from the time that it occurred, was I there. And now the Lord Eternal hath sent me, and his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus hath said the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am the Lord thy God who teach thee for thy profit, who lead thee by the way thou shouldst go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that thou hadst but listened to my commandments! then would have been as a river thy peace, and thy prosperity as the waves of the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And then would have been as the sand thy seed, and the offspring of thy body like the pebbles of the seashore; yet shall his name not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go forth out of Babylon, flee away from the Chaldeans, with the voice of singing declare, announce this, carry it forth as far as the end of the earth; say, The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; waters out of the rock he let drop down for them: and he cleaved the rock, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
