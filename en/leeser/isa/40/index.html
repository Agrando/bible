all flesh is grass, and all its goodliness is as the flower of the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the breath of the Lord hath blown upon it; surely the people is grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God will stand firm for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Upon a high mountain get thee up, thou that bringest good tidings to Zion; lift up with strength thy voice, thou who bringest good tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, here is your God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the Lord Eternal will come with might, and his arm ruleth for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Like a shepherd will he feed his flock: with his arm will he gather the lambs, and in his bosom will he carry them, will he lead gently those that suckle their young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who hath measured in the hollow of his hand the waters, and meted out the heavens with the span, and comprised in a measure the dust of the earth, and weighed in the scalebeam the mountains, and the hills in balances?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who hath meted out the Spirit of the Lord? and who was his counsellor that he could have given him information?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom took he counsel, that he gave him understanding, and taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and caused him to know the way of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, nations are as a drop out of a bucket, and as the small dust of the balance are they accounted: behold, isles are like the flying dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Lebanon is not sufficient for burning, and its beasts do not suffice for burntoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the nations are as naught before him; less than nothing, and vanity are they accounted to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The graven image the artificer hath cast and the goldsmith hath overspread it with gold, and fabricated on it silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that is skilled in the choice chooseth a wood that will not rot; he seeketh unto himself a skilful workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Know ye not? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not paid attention to the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is he that dwelleth above the circle of the earth, while its inhabitants are as grasshoppers; that stretched out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That bringeth princes to naught; rendering the judges of the earth as vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, they were not yet planted; yea, they were not yet sown; yea, their stem had not yet taken root in the earth: when he but breathed upon them, and they withered, and the stormwind carrieth them away as stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal to? saith the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these? he that bringeth out their host by number; that calleth them all by name; from the Mighty One not one escapeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why wilt thou say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hidden from the Lord, and my cause hath passed from the cognizance of my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Dost thou not know? hast thou not heard? The God of everlasting is the Lord, is the Creator of the ends of the earth; he will not be faint and weary; unsearchable is his understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He giveth to the faint strength; and to the powerless he imparteth much might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Though youths should grow faint and be weary, and young men should utterly stumble:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet they that wait upon the Lord shall acquire new strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk, and not become faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
