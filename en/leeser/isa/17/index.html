Behold, Damascus is deprived of being a city, and it shall become decaying ruins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Forsaken are the cities of Aroer: they shall be given up to flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And there shall cease the fortress from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: like the glory of the children of Israel shall they be, saith the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall come to pass on that day, that the glory of Jacob shall vanish, and the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standingcorn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there shall be left on it gleaningfruit, as one shaketh an olivetree, two or three berries on the top of the uppermost bough, four or five on the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, saith the Lord the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On that day shall a man turn his regard up to his Maker, and his eyes shall look toward the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he shall not turn his regard to the altars, the work of his hands; and he shall not look at what his fingers have made, both the groves and the sunimages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken ruin in a forest, and on a mountainpeak, which they left because of the children of Israel: and the land shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and the rock of thy strength thou hast not remembered; therefore wouldst thou plant luxuriant plantings, and wouldst set out the shoots of the stranger therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Already on the day that thou plantedst thou causedst to grow, and in the morning thou madest thy seed to blossom; but now fleeth the harvest on the day of disease and of incurable pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Woe to the raging of many people, who rage like the raging of the seas; and to the noise of nations, that make a noise like the roar of mighty waters!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The nations will make a noise like the roaring of many waters; but He will rebuke it, and it shall flee afar off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and as thistledown before the tempest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At eveningtide, behold, there is trouble; before yet it is morning it is no more.
