And Hezekiah wept aloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And out of the hand of the king of Assyria will I deliver thee and this city; and I will shield this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this shall be unto thee the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing which he hath spoken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I will cause the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down on the dial of Achaz by the sun, to return backward ten degrees. So the sun returned ten degrees, by the degrees which he was gone down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The writing of Hezekiah the king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I had said, In the midst of my days, must I enter the gates of the nether world; I am deprived of the residue of my years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I had said, I shall not see the Lord, the Lord, in the land of the living: I shall not behold man any more among the inhabitants of the regions of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My dwelling is broken down, and is removed from me as a shepherds tent: I have cut off, like a weaver, my life; with pining sickness will he snatch me away: from day until night wilt thou make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I waited with patience till morning, whether as a lion, so would he break all my bones: from day until night wilt thou make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like a swallow or a crane, so did I chirp; I did moan like a dove; my eyes were lifted up on high: O Lord, I am oppressed; grant me ease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What shall I speak? he hath promised it unto me, and he hath also accomplished it; I will make pilgrimages to Gods house all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Lord, by these things men will live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou give me health, and cause me to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, for peace I had great bitterness; but thou hast, in loving my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for thou hast cast behind thy back all my sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the nether world will not thank thee, death will not praise thee: they that go down into the pit will not hope for thy truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The living, the living alone shall thank thee, like me this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Lord is there to help me; therefore we will play my hymns all the days of our life in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the inflammation, and he shall recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
