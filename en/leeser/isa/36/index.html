And he halted by the aqueduct of the upper pool on the highway of the washers field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then came forth unto him Elyakim, the son of Chilkiyahu, who was superintendent over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Yoach the son of Assaph, the recorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Rabshakeh said unto them,Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus hath said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherewith thou hast trusted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have said, but it was only a word uttered with the lips, I have counsel and strength for the war. Now, on whom didst thou trust, that thou rebelledst against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, thou trustedst on yon cracked reedstaff, on Egypt; which, if a man lean on it, will enter into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh the king of Egypt to all that trust on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if thou shouldst say to me, In the Lord our God have we trusted: is he not the one whose highplaces and whose altars Hezekiah hath removed, when he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar shall ye prostrate yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now I pray thee, enter into a contest with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How then wilt thou turn back the face of a single chieftain of the least of my masters servants, while thou hast put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now am I come up without the Lords will against this land to destroy it? The Lord hath said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Elyakim and Shebna and Yoach unto Rabshakeh, Speak, we pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jewish language, before the ears of the people that are on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master then sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? is it not rather to the men who sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own excrements, and drink their own urine with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then stood Rabshakeh up, and called out in a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus hath said the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither let Hezekiah induce you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus hath said the king of Assyria, Make a treaty of peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his figtree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So that Hezekiah may not mislead you, saying, The Lord will deliver us. Have the gods of the nations delivered each his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where are the gods of Chamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvayim? and have they then delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they remained silent, and answered him not a word; for it was the kings command, saying, Ye shall not answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came Elyakim the son of Chilkiyahu, that was superintendent over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Yoach the son of Assaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent; and they told him the words of Rabshakeh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
