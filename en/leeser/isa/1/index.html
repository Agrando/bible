that ye increase the revolt? every head is sick, and every heart is faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire; your soilin your presence, strangers devour it, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And left is the daughter of Zion as a hut in a vineyard, as a lodge in a cucumber field, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Unless the Lord of hosts had left unto us a remnant ever so small, like Sodom should we have been, unto Gomorrah should we have been compared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom: give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For what serveth me the multitude of your sacrifices?
