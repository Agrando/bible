I am the Lord, and there is no one else;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Forming the light, and creating darkness; making peace, and creating evil: I the Lord do all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Drop down ye heavens, and let the skies distil blessing; let the earth open and let them all be fruitful of prosperity, and let righteousness spring up likewise: I the Lord have created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe unto him that contendeth with the one who formed hima potsherd among the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What bringest thou forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus hath said the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and he who hath formed him, About events to come will you ask me? concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands will ye command me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When I myself have made the earth, and created man upon it; when I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and I have ordained all their host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I myself have waked him up in righteousness, and all his ways will I make straight: he shall build my city, and my exiles shall he dismiss free, not for purchasemoney nor for presents, saith the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus hath said the Lord, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of high stature, shall pass over unto thee, and thine shall they be: behind thee shall they walk; in chains shall they pass along, and unto thee shall they bow, unto thee shall they pray, saying Yea, only among thee is God; and there is no one else beside God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They are ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: together shall they go to confusion that are makers of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Israel shall be helped by the Lord with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed and not be confounded unto all eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus hath said the Lord the creator of the heavens; he, the God that formed the earth and made it; he that hath established it,not for naught did he create it, to be inhabited did he form it: I am the Lord; and there is no one else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Not on a secret spot have I spoken, in a dark place of the earth; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me for naught; but I the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye escaped fugitives of the nations! They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: Who hath announced this in ancient times? told it from the beginning? is it not I the Lord? and there is no other god without me, a just god and a saviour; there is none beside me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Turn unto me, so that ye may be helped, all ye ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no one else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By myself have I sworn, righteousness is gone out of my mouth, a word which shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bend, every tongue shall swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only in the Lord,shall men say of me,there are righteousness and strength. Unto him shall come and be ashamed all that are incensed against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the Lord shall be justified, and shall glory themselves all the seed of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
