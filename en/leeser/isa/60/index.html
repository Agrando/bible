because unto thee shall be turned the abundance of the sea, the riches of nations shall come unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; they all from Sheba shall come: gold and frankincense shall they carry, and the praises of the Lord shall they announce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the flocks of Kedar shall be assembled unto thee, the rams of Nebayoth shall minister unto thee: they shall come for a favorable acceptance unto me upon my altar, and the house of my glory will I glorify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like the doves, to their windows?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yea, unto me the inhabitants of the isles shall hasten, and the ships of Tharshish at first, to bring thy sons from afar, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel; because he hath glorified thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of the stranger shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; for in my wrath did I smite thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thy gates shall stand open continually, day and night shall they not be closed, to bring unto thee the wealth of nations, and their kings led captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; and the nations shall be utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir, the cypress, and the box together, to adorn the place of my sanctuary, and the resting place of my feet will I glorify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And then shall come unto thee bent down the sons of those who afflicted thee, and there shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet all thy revilers; and they shall call thee, The city of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead that thou wast forsaken and hated, without one to pass through thee, will I render thee an excellency of everlasting, a joy of all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou shalt suck the milk of nations, and the breast of kings shalt thou suck;
