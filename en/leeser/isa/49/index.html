On the roads shall they feed, and on all mountainpeaks shall be their pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall not be hungry nor thirsty, and neither heat nor sun shall smite them; for he that hath mercy on them will lead them, and by springs of water will he guide them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will change all my mountains into a road, and my highways shall be lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these shall come from afar; and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth, O mountains, into song; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and upon his oppressed will he have mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet Zion said, the Eternal hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Can a woman forget her sucking child, not to have mercy on the son of her body? yea, should these even forget, yet would I not forget thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, upon the palms of my hands have I engraved thee; thy walls are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thy children come in haste; thy destroyers and they that laid thee waste shall go away from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lift up thy eyes round about, and see; they all are assembled together, they come to thee: as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thyself with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thy ruins and thy desolate places, and thy wasted land,yea, now shall it be too narrow for thee by reason of the inhabitants, and thy destroyers shall be far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet again will say before thy ears the children of whom thou wast deprived, The place is too narrow for me; make room for me that I may dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou wilt say in thy heart, Who hath born me these, seeing I was bereft of my children, and was solitary, an exile, and outcast? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left entirely alone; these, where have they been?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will lift up to the nations my hand, and to the people will I raise up high my standard; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And kings shall be thy nursingfathers, and their princesses thy nursingmothers; with the face toward the earth shall they bow down to thee, and the dust of thy feet shall they lick up: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, who will not suffer those who hope in me to be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or shall the captive of the victor escape?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For thus hath said the Lord, Also the captive of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the powerful shall escape; and with those who contend against thee will I contend, and thy children will I indeed save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will feed thy oppressors with their own flesh; and as with new wine shall they be made drunken with their own blood: and all flesh shall know that I the Eternal am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer the Mighty One of Jacob.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
