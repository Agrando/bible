and who knoweth us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Oh your perverseness! shall the potter be esteemed as the clay? that the work shall say of its maker, He hath not made me? or shall the thing framed say of its framer, He had no understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Lo! but yet a very little while more, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and out of obscurity, and out of darkness, shall the eyes of the blind see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sufferers shall have abundant joy in the Lord, and the needy among men shall be glad in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the tyrant is no more, and consumed is the scorner, and cut off are all that watch for injustice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That cause mankind to sin by their word; and lay a snare for him that reproveth them in the gate; and pervert through fraud the cause of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus hath said the Lord unto the house of Jacob, he who hath redeemed Abraham, Not now shall Jacob be ashamed, and not now shall his face be made pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For when he seeth his children, the work of my hands in the midst of him, how they sanctify my name: then will they sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and the God of Israel will they reverence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They also that were erring in spirit shall acquire understanding, and they that murmured shall obtain instruction.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
