And I said, Here am I: send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Go, and say unto this people, Hear indeed, but understand not; and see indeed, but know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Obdurate will remain the heart of this people, and their ears will be heavy, and their eyes will be shut: so that they will not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor their hearts be understanding, so that they be converted, and healing be granted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until that cities be left waste without an inhabitant, and houses without man, and the soil be made desolate as a wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Lord will have removed far away the men, and the depopulation be great in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And should a tenth part thereof yet remain, it will again be swept away: yet like the terebinth and the oak, which, when they cast their leaves, retain their stems, so remaineth the holy seed, its stem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
