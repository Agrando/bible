As tempests in the south blow with fury; so doth it come from the desert, from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A hard vision hath been told unto me; the traitor dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. "Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media;" all sighing have I caused to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore are my loins filled with pain; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I am too much cramped to hear; I am too much dismayed to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart wandereth astray, dread affrighteth me: the evening of my pleasure hath he turned unto me into terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Prepare the table, put on the candlesticks, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath said unto me the Lord, Go, set the watchman, what he seeth let him tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he will see chariots, horsemen in couples, riders on asses, riders on camels; and he shall listen diligently with much heed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he calleth like a lion, Upon the watchtower, O Lord, do I stand continually in the daytime, and on my ward am I set all the nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, here cometh a chariot with men, horsemen in couples, and he commenceth and saith, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods hath he shivered unto the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my downtrodden people, and the son of my threshingfloor: that which I have heard from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have I told unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The doom of Dumah. Unto me one calleth out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night?
