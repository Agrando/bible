Shall I for these things repent me of the evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou placed thy couch: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And behind the doors and the doorposts hast thou placed thy mark of remembrance; for departing from me, thou hast laid open, and art gone up,hast enlarged thy couch, and made thee a covenant with some of them; thou hast loved their lying with thee, hast selected a fitting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou didst show thyself unto the king without ointment, and thou didst multiply thy perfumes, and thou didst send out thy messengers even into the faroff distance, and didst debase thyself even down to the nether world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Though thou art wearied by the length of thy way, yet saidst thou not, It is useless: thou hadst found enough for thy hand; therefore didst thou feel no care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And of whom hadst thou dread or fear, that thou becamest false, and didst not remember me, nor lay it to thy heart? is it not so? I kept silence, and this from earliest times, and therefore thou fearest me not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I, I ever tell thee what deeds would be thy righteousness; but thy worksthese indeed will not profit thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When thou criest, let thy masses of idols deliver thee; but all of them will the wind carry away, a breath will take them off; but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, clear out the way, lift up every stumbling block out of the way of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus hath said the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, In the high and holy place do I dwell, yet also with the contrite and humble of spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For not to eternity will I contend, neither will I be for ever wroth: when the spirit from before me is overwhelmed, and the souls which I have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and I smote him, hiding my face, and was wroth: while he went on frowardly in the way of his own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I now see his ways, and I will heal him; and I will guide him, and bestow full comforts on him and on his mourners;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Creating the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can never be at rest, but its waters cast up mire and dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
