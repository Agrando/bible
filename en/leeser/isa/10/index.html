For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Woe over Asshur, the rod of my anger; and a staff is in their hand my indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Against a hypocritical nation will I send him, and against the people of my fury will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to carry off the prey, and to render them trodden down like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But he deemeth it not so, and his heart doth not think so; but to destroy is in his heart, and to cut off nations not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he saith, "Are not my princes altogether kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not Calno like Karkemish?
