And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they may say unto thee; for not thee have they rejected, but me have they rejected, that I should not reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In accordance with all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even until this day, when they forsook me, and served other gods: so do they also unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now hearken unto their voice: nevertheless thou must still solemnly forewarn them, and tell them the manner of the king that will reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Samuel said all the words of the Lord unto the people that had asked of him a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, This will be the manner of the king that will reign over you: Your sons will he take, and appoint them for himself with his chariots, and among his horsemen; and they will have to run before his chariot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to appoint for himself captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and to plough his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And your daughters will he take for ointment makers, and for cooks, and for bakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, yea the best, will he take, and give them to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And of your seeds, and of your vineyards will he take the tenth, and give the same to his officers, and to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And your menservants, and your maidservants, and your best young men, and your asses will he take, and employ them for his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Of your flocks will he take the tenth: and ye yourselves will become his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And ye will cry out on that day because of your king whom ye will have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but a king shall be over us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That we also may ourselves be like all the nations: and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them before the ears of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and appoint them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
