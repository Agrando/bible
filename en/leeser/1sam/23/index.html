And the Lord said unto David, Go and smite among the Philistines, and deliver Keilah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Davids men said unto him, Behold, here in Judah are we afraid: how much more then if we should go to Keilah against the battlearrays of the Philistines?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then David asked yet again counsel of the Lord. And the Lord answered him and said, Arise, Go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So David and his men went to Keilah; and he fought with the Philistines, and lead away their cattle, and smote among them a great slaughter. So David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when Ebyathar the son of Achimelech, fled over to David, to Keilah, that the ephod came down with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was told to Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David understood that Saul secretly devised mischief against him; and he said to Ebyathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said David, O Lord, God of Israel, thy servant hath heard for certain that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? O Lord, God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the Lord said, He will come down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said David, Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul! And the Lord said, They will surrender.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then arose David and his men, about six hundred men, and departed out of Keilah, and wandered about whithersoever they could go. And when it was told to Saul that David was escaped from Keilah, he forbore to go forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David remained in the wilderness in strongholds, and abode on the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him all the time, but God delivered him not into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David saw that Saul was gone forth to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jonathan, the son of Saul, arose and went to David into the forest, and strengthened his hand in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father will not find thee; and thou wilt be king over Israel, and I will be next unto thee; and also Saul my father knoweth this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they made, both of them, a covenant before the Lord: and David remained in the forest; but Jonathan went to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came up the Ziphites unto Saul to Gibah, saying, Behold, David is hiding himself with us in the strongholds in the forest, on the hill of Chachilah, which is on the right of the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now in accordance with all the longing of thy soul, O king, to come down, come down; and our part shall be to surrender him into the kings hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the Lord; for ye have pity on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Go, I pray you, make yet more preparations, and remark and see his place where his foot may be, who hath seen him there; for I am told that he dealeth with great subtilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>See therefore, and remark every one of all the lurkingplaces where he usually hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the right of the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Saul and his men went to make a search. And they told it to David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard this, he pursued after David into the wilderness of Maon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away from before Saul; and Saul and his men were compassing David and his men to seize them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But a messenger came unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammachlekoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And David went up from there, and dwelt in strongholds of Engedi.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
