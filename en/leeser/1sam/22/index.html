Then David departed, and came into the forest of Chereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, now Saul was sitting in Gibah under the tamarisk on the hill, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Saul unto his servants that stood about him, Hear, I pray you, men of Benjamin! will the son of Jesse give, indeed, to every one of you fields and vineyards? will he appoint you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That ye have conspired, all of you, against me, and there is none that informeth me, while my son hath made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is concerned for me, or informeth me that my son hath stirred up my servant to lie in wait against me, as it is this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Achimelech the son of Achitub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he asked counsel for him of the Lord, and he gave him provision, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then sent the king to call Achimelech, the son of Achitub, the priest, and all his fathers house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came, all of them, to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Achitub. And he said, here am I, my Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou didst give him bread, and a sword, and hast asked counsel for him of God, that he should rise to lie in wait against me, as it is this day!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then answered Achimelech the king, and said, And who is among all thy servants so trusted as David, and the kings soninlaw, and freely admitted to thy private council, and is honored in thy house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Did I this day then begin to ask counsel for him of God? far be it from me; let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knew not of all this, either a little or great thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Achimelech, thou, and all thy fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king said unto the runners that stood about him, Turn round and slay the priests of the Lord; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he was fleeing, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not stretch forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou round, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned round, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day eighty and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and lambs, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there escaped one of the sons of Achimelech the son of Achitub, whose name was Ebyathar, and he fled after David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ebyathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said unto Ebyathar, I knew on that day, because Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have myself occasioned the death of all the persons of thy fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Remain thou with me, fear nothing; for he that will seek my life will seek thy life; but thou shalt be well guarded with me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
