And the word of the Lord was scarce in those days: prophecy was not extended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it came to pass one day, when Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyes had begun to grow dim, he could not see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the lamp of God had not yet gone out, while Samuel was lying down in the hall of the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That the Lord called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord continued to call again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I did not call, my son: lie down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Samuel knew not yet the Lord, nor had the word of the Lord been as yet revealed unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Lord continued to call, Samuel, the third time; and he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli then perceived that the Lord was calling the lad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. And Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Lord came, and placed himself, and called as at previous times, Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On that day will I fulfill on Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house: I will begin and finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I tell him that I will judge his house for ever; for the iniquity that he knew that his sons were drawing a curse on themselves, and he restrained them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And therefore have I sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Elis house shall not be atoned for with sacrifice or meatoffering for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel lay until the morning, when he opened the doors of the house of the Lord; and Samuel feared to tell the vision unto Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, What is the word which he hath spoken unto thee? do not, I pray thee, conceal it from me: may God do to thee thus, and continue to do so, if thou conceal any thing from me of all the word that he hath spoken unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel told him all the words, and concealed nothing from him. And he said, He is the Lord: let him do what seemeth good in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel grew up, and the Lord was with him, and he did not let fall any one of all his words to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And thus knew all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba that Samuel was accredited as a prophet of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh; for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
