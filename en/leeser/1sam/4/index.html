Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenhaezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Philistines put themselves in battlearray against Israel; and the battle became general, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew on the battleground, in the field, about four thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when the people were come back into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us this day before the Philistines? Let us bring over to us out of Shiloh the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that it may come in the midst of us, and deliver us out of the hand of our enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought away from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth over the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, that all Israel set up a great shout, so that the earth trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Philistines were afraid; for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for the like of this hath not been, yesterday or the day before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be strong, and act like men, O Philistines, so that ye become not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been servants to you: therefore act like men, and fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were smitten, and they fled every man unto his tent: and the defeat was very great; and there fell of Israel thirty thousand men on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there ran a man of Benjamin from the battlefield, and came to Shiloh on the same day, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon a chair by the wayside watching; for his heart was anxious for the ark of God. And when the man came to tell it in the city, all the city cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this multitude? And the man came in hastily, and told it to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were fixed, so that he could not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man said unto Eli, I am the person that came from the battlefield, and I myself fled from the battlefield today. And he said, What was it that took place, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath also been a great slaughter among the people, and also thy two sons, Chophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God hath been taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off the chair backward by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken, and he died; for the man was old, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And his daughterinlaw, the wife of Phinehas, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings concerning that the ark of God had been taken, and that her fatherinlaw and her husband were dead, she sank down and gave birth; for her pains came suddenly upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And at the moment of her dying, the women that stood around her spoke unto her, Fear not; for a son hast thou born. But she answered not, nor did she take it to heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, Glory is departed from Israel; because of the taking away of the ark of God, and because of her fatherinlaw and her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she said, Glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God hath been taken away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
