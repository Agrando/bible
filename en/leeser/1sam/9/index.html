So they went unto the city where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found some maidens going out to draw water; and they said unto them, Is the seer here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for this day came he to the city; because the people have a sacrifice today on the highplace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As soon as ye are come into the city, ye will straightway find him, before yet he can go up to the highplace to eat; for the people will not eat until he be come, because he always blesseth the sacrifice; afterward eat those that are invited; and now go you up; for just today will ye surely find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they went up into the city. They were entering into the city, when, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the highplace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord had revealed to Samuels ear one day before Sauls coming, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>About this time tomorrow will I send unto thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him as chief over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have beheld my people, because their cry is come unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord addressed him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to thee, This one shall rule over my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul drew near to Samuel within the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where is the house of the seer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the highplace, and ye shall eat with me today; and I will let thee go in the morning, and all that is in thy heart will I tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for thy asses that were lost unto thee this day three days ago, do not set thy heart on them; for they have been found. And to whom belongeth all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not to thee, and to all thy fathers house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul answered and said, Am not I a son of Benjamin, of one of the smallest tribes of Israel? and is not my family the least of all the families of the tribes of Benjamin? wherefore then hast thou spoken to me such thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the apartment; and he assigned them a place at the head of the invited guests, who were about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said unto the cook, Hand here the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Put it away by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul; and he said, Behold what is left! set it before thee, and eat; for unto this time hath it been kept from thee, since I said, I have invited the people. And Saul ate with Samuel on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they went down from the highplace into the city, and he spoke with Saul upon the roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they got up early; and it came to pass when the morningdawn arose, that Samuel called Saul to the roof, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out, both of them, he and Samuel, into the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Say to the servant that he pass on before us,and he passed on,but thou remain standing a while, and I will let thee hear the word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
