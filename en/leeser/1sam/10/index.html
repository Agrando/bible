Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the highplace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither were ye gone? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were nowhere, we went to Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Sauls uncle said, Do tell me, I pray thee, what did Samuel say unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses had been found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel had spoken, he told him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to Mizpah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said unto the children of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, I brought up Israel from Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ye for your part have this day rejected your God, he who hath saved you out of all your misfortunes and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nevertheless, thou must set a king over us: and now present yourselves before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samuel caused all the tribes of Israel to come near; and the tribe of Benjamin was seized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near according to its families, and the family of Matri was seized, and then was seized Saul the son of Kish: and they sought him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they inquired again of the Lord, Is the man yet come hither? And the Lord said, Behold, he hath hidden himself among the vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they ran and fetched him thence, and he placed himself erect in the midst of the people, and he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Samuel said to all the people, Have ye seen him whom the Lord hath made choice of, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, Long live the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then did Samuel speak to the people the rights of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it down before the Lord. And Samuel sent away all the people, every man to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Saul also went to his home to Gibah; and there went with him a large crowd, whose heart God had touched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the worthless men said, In what can this help us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he acted as though he were deaf.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
