I will call unto the Lord, and he will send thunders and rain; and ye will thus perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done, in the eyes of the Lord, to ask for yourselves a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel called unto the Lord; and the Lord sent thunders and rain on that day: and all the people feared greatly the Lord and Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray in behalf of thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we may not die; for we have added unto all our sins yet this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, and serve ye the Lord with all your heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And turn ye not aside; for then would ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; because they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Lord will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name; because it hath pleased the Lord to make you a people unto himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray in behalf of you; but I will teach you the good and the right way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for see what great things he hath done with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if ye will in any wise do wickedly, both ye yourselves as also your king shall perish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
