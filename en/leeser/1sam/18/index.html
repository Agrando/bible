And David turned aside out of his presence twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul was afraid of David; because the Lord was with him, and from Saul he was departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore Saul removed him from himself, and made him his captain over a thousand: and he went out and came in before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David was successful on all his ways; and the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Saul saw that he was very successful, he was in dread of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But all Israel and Judah loved David; because he went out and came in before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said to David, Behold, here is my eldest daughter Merab, her will I give to thee for wife: only be thou unto me a man of valor, and fight the Lords battles. And Saul thought, Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my fathers family in Israel, that I should be a soninlaw to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But it happened at the time when Merab, Sauls daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Mecholathite for wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Michal Sauls daughter loved David: and they told it to Saul, and the thing was right in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may become unto him a snare, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Through the second shalt thou this day become my soninlaw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul commanded his servants, Speak to David secretly, saying, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee; and now thou must become the kings soninlaw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the servants of Saul spoke in the ears of David these words. And David said, Doth it seem so light in your eyes to become the kings soninlaw, seeing that I am a poor man, and of light esteem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, Words such as these David hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged on the kings enemies. But Saul thought to cause David to fall by the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when his servants told David these words, the thing was pleasing in the eyes of David to become the kings soninlaw: and the days were not complete,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When David arose and went, he and his men, and smote of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they counted them out in full to the king, that he might become the kings soninlaw. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter for wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Saul saw and understood that the Lord was with David: and Michal, Sauls daughter, loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was Davids enemy all the time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the princes of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass, whenever they went forth, that David was more successful than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was highly prized.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
