And Saul blew the cornet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all Israel heard it, saying, Saul hath smitten the outpost of the Philistines, and the Israelites also have put themselves in illfavor with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude; and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, for the people were oppressed, then did the people hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in strongholds, and in pits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some of the Hebrews passed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilad. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him hastily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed; but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattering themselves from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Saul said, Bring hither to me the burntoffering and the peaceofferings. And he offered the burntoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burntoffering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said, What hast thou done: And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattering themselves from me, whereas thou camest not at the appointed day, and the Philistines are gathering themselves together at Michmash;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I said, The Philistines will now come down unto me to Gilgal, and I have not yet made supplication unto the Lord: wherefore I forced myself, and offered the burntoffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he had commanded thee; for now would the Lord have established thy government over Israel for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now thy government shall not endure: the Lord hath sought out for himself a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath ordained him to be chief over his people; because thou hast not kept what the Lord had commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal unto Gibah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were to be found with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were to be found with them, were lying in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines were encamped in Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the troop of freebooters went out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned into the way to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another company turned into the way to Bethchoron; and the other company turned into the way to the frontier that looketh over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, So that the Hebrews shall not make themselves swords or spears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his ploughshare, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they used a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the threepronged forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it came to pass on the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan; but they were found with Saul and with Jonathan his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the outpost of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
