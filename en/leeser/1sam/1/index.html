And at that place were the two sons of Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, priests of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the day was come that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for Hannah he loved greatly; but the Lord had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her rival also provoked her continually, in order to make her fret; because the Lord had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he did so year by year, as often as she went up to the house of the Lord, so did she provoke her; wherefore she wept, and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said to her Elkanah her husband, Hannah, why wilt thou weep? and why wilt thou not eat? and why should thy heart be grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; and Eli the priest was sitting upon a chair by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But she had bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a manchild: then will I give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, as she continued praying long before the Lord, that Eli watched her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now as for Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; wherefore Eli regarded her as a drunken woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from off thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said, No, my Lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; but neither wine nor strong drink have I drunk, and I have poured out my soul before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Esteem not thy handmaid as a worthless woman; for out of the abundance of my grief and vexation have I spoken hitherto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant thy petition which thou hast asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy eyes. The woman then went on her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no longer as before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and prostrated themselves before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house at Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, after the lapse of some time, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel, saying, Because from the Lord have I asked him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elkanah went up, with all his house, to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah did not go up; for she said unto her husband, So soon as the child shall be weaned, then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and abide there for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth good in thy eyes; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only may the Lord fulfill his word. So the woman remained behind, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she took him up with her, when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him unto the house of the Lord at Shiloh; although the child was yet young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, Pardon, my Lord, as thy soul liveth, my Lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, to pray unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this lad did I pray; and the Lord hath granted me my petition which I asked of him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore also have I lent him, for my part, to the Lord; all the days that have been assigned to him shall he be lent to the Lord. And he bowed himself there before the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
