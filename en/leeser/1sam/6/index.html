And they answered, According to the number of the lords of the Philistines, five golden hemorrhoids, and five golden mice; for one plague affected them all, and your lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore make images of your hemorrhoids, and images of your mice that devastate the land; and give glory unto the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And why will ye harden your heart, just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? Did not they, when he had wrought wonderful deeds among them, dismiss them, and they departed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now make a new wagon, and take two milchcows, on which there hath come no yoke, and harness the cows to the wagon, and bring their calves home away from them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And take the ark of the Lord, and place it into the wagon; and the articles of gold, which ye return him as a trespassoffering, ye must put in a casket alongside of it; and then send it away, that it may go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And then see, if it go up by the way to its own boundary, to Bethshemesh, then hath he done us this great evil; but if not, then shall we know that not his hand hath smitten us; it is a chance which hath happened to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men did so; and they took two milchcows, and harnessed them to the wagon, and their calves they shut up at home:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they placed the ark of the Lord in the wagon, and the casket with the mice of gold and images of their hemorrhoids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the cows went straight forward on the way on the road to Bethshemesh: on one highway they did go along, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Bethshemesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and when they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the wagon came to the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite, and stood still there; and there was a great stone; and they split the wood of the wagon, and the cows they offered as a burntoffering unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the casket that was with it, wherein were the articles of gold, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Bethshemesh offered buntofferings and sacrificed sacrifices on the same day unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron on the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these are the golden hemorrhoids which the Philistines returned as a trespassoffering unto the Lord: For Ashdod one, for Gazzah one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the golden mice were according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines under the five lords, from the fortified city, down to the open village, even unto the great stone whereon they had set down the ark of the Lord, and which is unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he smote among the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, namely, he smote among the people seventy men and fifty thousand men: and the people mourned because the Lord had caused among the people a great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God? and to whom shall it go up away from us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiryathyearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord: come ye down, and fetch it up to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
