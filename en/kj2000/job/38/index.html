or who laid its cornerstone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And prescribed bounds for it, and set bars and doors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And said, Thus far shall you come, but no farther: and here shall your proud waves be stopped?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have you commanded the morning since your days began; and caused the dawn to know its place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It is turned as clay under the seal; and they stand out as a garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the uplifted arm shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have you entered into the springs of the sea?
