Thus did Job continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, From where come you? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one that fears God, and turns away from evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have not you made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brotherâ€™s house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone am escaped to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone am escaped to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone am escaped to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brotherâ€™s house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I alone am escaped to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, and tore his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshiped,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And said, Naked came I out of my motherâ€™s womb, and naked shall I return there: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God with wrong.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
