my wound is incurable though I am without transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What man is like Job, who drinks up scorn like water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore hearken unto me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has given him charge over the earth? or who has laid on him the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he should set his heart upon man, if he should gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again unto dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If now you have understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall even he that hates right govern? and will you condemn him that is most just?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is it fit to say to a king, You are wicked? and to princes, You are ungodly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How much less to him that regards not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without a hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he sees all his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he will not lay upon man more than what is right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That the hypocrite reigns not, lest the people be ensnared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Surely it is fitting to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That which I see not you teach me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Should it be according to your mind? he will recompense it, whether you refuse, or whether you choose; and not I: therefore declare what you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because he answers like wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he adds rebellion unto his sin, he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
