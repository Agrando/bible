And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto her, Because I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So she wrote letters in Ahabâ€™s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, so that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall speak unto him, saying, Thus says the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak unto him, saying, Thus says the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab every male, and he that is shut up and left in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He that dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and he that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his sonâ€™s days will I bring the evil upon his house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
