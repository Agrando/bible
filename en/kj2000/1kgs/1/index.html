And the king said, What would you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said unto him, My lord, you swore by the LORD your God unto your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, you know it not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army: but Solomon your servant has he not called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the kingâ€™s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, has he not invited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not showed it unto your servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the kingâ€™s presence, and stood before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king swore, and said, As the LORD lives, that has redeemed my soul out of all distress,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even as I swore unto you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my place; even so will I certainly do this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and knelt before to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my place: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king Davidâ€™s mule, and brought him to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the people came up after him, and the people played on flutes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with the sound of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for you are a valiant man, and bring good tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David has made Solomon king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the kingâ€™s mule:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city resounds with it. This is the noise that you have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And moreover the kingâ€™s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon: for, lo, he has caught hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to your house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
