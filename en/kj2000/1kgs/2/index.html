And she said, Come you peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto you. And she said, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: however the kingdom has turned about, and has become my brotherâ€™s: for it was his from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Speak, I pray you, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say nay to you,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to be my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for you unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the kingâ€™s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then she said, I desire one small petition of you; I pray you, say not nay to me. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say nay to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he struck him down so that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, unto your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, strike him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king said unto him, Do as he has said, and strike him down, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who struck down two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing of it, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his descendants forever: but upon David, and upon his descendants, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and struck him down, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the place of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build you a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there anywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For it shall be, that on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be upon your own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make you to swear by the LORD, and admonished you, saying, Know for a certain, on the day you go out, and travel anywhere, that you shall surely die? and you said unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged you with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which was in your heart, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness upon your own head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and struck him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
