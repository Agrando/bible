And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burned it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomonâ€™s wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Solomon built Gezer, and lower Beth-horon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the cities of storage that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, of those did Solomon conscript for forced labor unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no slaves: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomonâ€™s work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that did the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Pharaohâ€™s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, seaman that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came to Ophir, and brought from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
