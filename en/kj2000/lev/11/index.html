for they are an abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps, neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be defiled by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For I am the LORD your God: you shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For I am the LORD that brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This is the law of the animals, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps upon the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the animal that may be eaten and the animal that may not be eaten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
