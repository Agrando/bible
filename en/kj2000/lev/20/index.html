he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his children unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if the people of the land do in any way hide their eyes from the man, when he gives of his children unto Molech, and kill him not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that play the harlot with him, to commit harlotryafter Molech, from among their people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the soul that turns after mediums, and after wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be you holy: for I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD who sanctifies you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For every one that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the man that lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have committed perversion; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If a man also lies with a man, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man takes a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burned with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if a man lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death: and you shall slay the animal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a woman approaches unto any animal, and lies with it, you shall kill the woman, and the animal: they shall surely be put to death;
