And Aaron held his peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD has kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.
