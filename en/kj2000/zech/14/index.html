and the city shall be taken, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished; and half of the cityshall go forth into captivity, and the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in two, toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and she shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, and the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no longer utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall rot away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall rot away in their sockets, and their tongue shall rot away in their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great panic from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so shall be the plague on the horse, on the mule, on the camel, and on the donkey, and on all the beasts that shall be in these tents, so shall this plague be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall come to pass, that everyone that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall be, that whosoever will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the family of Egypt goes not up, and comes not, they will have no rain; there shall be the plague, with which the LORD will smite the nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in them: and in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
