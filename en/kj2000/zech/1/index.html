And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show you what these are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits quietly, and is at rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these threescore and ten years?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good and comforting words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I am very much displeased with the nations that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they furthered the disaster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore thus says the LORD; I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, says the LORD of hosts, and a measuring line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Cry again, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall again be spread abroad; and the LORD shall again comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said I, What are these coming to do?
