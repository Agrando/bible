And I took unto me two staffs; the one I called Grace, and the other I called Unity; and I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their souls also abhorred me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I took my staff, even Grace, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I said unto them, If you think it good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a princely price that I was valued at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I cut asunder my other staff, even Unity, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto you yet the implements of a foolish shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who shall not visit those that are cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that which stands: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their hoofs in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaves the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be wholly dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
