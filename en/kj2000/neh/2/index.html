Now I had never been sad before in his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore the king said unto me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And said unto the king, Let the king live forever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathersâ€™ sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said unto me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathersâ€™ sepulchers, that I may rebuild it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall your journey be? and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may let me pass over till I come into Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the kingâ€™s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which pertains to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the temple that I shall enter into. And the king so granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the kingâ€™s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any animal with me, except the animal that I rode upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even to the jackalâ€™s well, and to the refuse gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down; and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the kingâ€™s pool: but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then went I up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said I unto them, You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we are no more a reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the kingâ€™s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed at us, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
