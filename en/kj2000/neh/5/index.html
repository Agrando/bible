And I held a great assembly against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold unto the nations; and will you even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also I said, It is not good what you do: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, are lending them money and grain: I pray you, let us stop this charging interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performs not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the food allowance of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the former governors that had been before me laid burdens upon the people, and had taken of them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered there unto the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that are about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days abundant stores of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the food allowance of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
