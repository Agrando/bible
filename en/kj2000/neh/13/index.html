And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the storehouse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I made treasurers over the storehouse, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their duty was to distribute unto their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; and also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them about the day in which they sold provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There dwelt men of Tyre also there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge you before the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the language of Judah, but according to the language of each people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I contended with them, and pronounced them cursed, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus cleansed I them from everything foreign, and assigned the duties of the priests and the Levites, each one to his service;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
