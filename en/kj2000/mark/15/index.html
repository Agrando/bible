And he answering said unto him, You say it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answer you nothing? behold how many things they witness against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had always done unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will you that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him out of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will you then that I shall do unto him whom you call the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so Pilate, willing to satisfy the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they called together the whole band.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they struck him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they compelled one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they brought him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots for them, what every man should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the superscription of his accusation was written, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with him they crucified two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the scripture was fulfilled, which said, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they that passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you that destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Save yourself, and come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.
