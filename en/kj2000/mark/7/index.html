And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, bronze vessels, and of tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not your disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He answered and said unto them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such things you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto them, Full well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift devoted to God, whatsoever you might have received from me; he shall be free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you allow him no more to do anything for his father or his mother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Making the word of God of no effect through your tradition, which you have delivered: and many such things do you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing from outside a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said unto them, Are you so without understanding also? Do you not perceive, that whatsoever thing from outside enters into the man, it cannot defile him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the drain, purging all foods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, That which came out of the man, that defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And from there he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into a house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race; and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not right to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said unto her, For this saying go your way; the demon is gone out of your daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when she was come to her house, she found the demon gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again, departing from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they brought unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they besought him to put his hand upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more zealously they proclaimed it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
