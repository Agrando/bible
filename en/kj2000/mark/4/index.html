and how then will you know all parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower sows the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are they by the wayside, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan comes immediately, and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these are they likewise who are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these are they who are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And these are they who are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said unto them, Is a lamp brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was anything kept secret, but that it should come into the open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said unto them, Take heed what you hear: with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he that has, to him shall be given: and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth brings forth fruit of itself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, With what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all plants, and shoots out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables he spoke the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But without a parable he spoke not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the same day, when the evening was come, he said unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him just as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he was in the rear of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awoke him, and said unto him, Teacher, care you not that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said unto them, Why are you so fearful? how is it that you have no faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
