And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And would not allow that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people were astonished at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when evening was come, he went out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter calling to remembrance said unto him, Teacher, behold, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answering said unto them, Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be removed, and be cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I say unto you, whatever things you desire, when you pray, believe that you will receive them, and you shall have them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against any: that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they came again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there came to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And said unto him, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority to do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering said unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
