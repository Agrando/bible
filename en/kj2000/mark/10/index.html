But Jesus answered again, and said unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus looking upon them said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were on the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Teacher, we would that you should do for us whatsoever we shall desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said unto them, What would you that I should do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left hand, in your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said unto them, You know not what you ask: can you drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized shall you be baptized:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Jesus called them to him, and said unto them, You know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their leaders exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever would be great among you, shall be your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whosoever of you will be the first, shall be servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the roadside begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, You son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered and said unto him, What will you that I should do unto you? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said unto him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
