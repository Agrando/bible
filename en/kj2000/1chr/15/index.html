Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the sons of Gershom;

and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with them their brethren of the second order, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of bronze;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with harps according to Alamoth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with lyres according to the Sheminith, to lead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, in music: he instructed about the music, because he was skillful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the music with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making music with lyres and harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
