And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they made a circuit of seven daysâ€™ journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel said, Alas! the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israelâ€™s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, Thus says the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus says the LORD, You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that you may drink, both you, and your cattle, and your animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up all wells of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and older, and stood in the border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck down the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and covered it; and they stopped up all the wells of water, and cut down all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they its stones; the slingers surrounded it, and conquered it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
