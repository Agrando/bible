And his motherâ€™s name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozcath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work who are in the house of the LORD, to repair the damages of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the kingâ€™s, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go you, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they talked with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said unto them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Concerning the words which you have heard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because your heart was tender, and you have humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold therefore, I will gather you unto your fathers, and you shall be gathered into your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
