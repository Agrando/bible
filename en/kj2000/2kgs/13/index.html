And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the kingâ€™s hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORDâ€™S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for you shall smite the Syrians in Aphek, till you have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Strike the ground. And he struck three times, and stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall strike down Syria but three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land in the spring of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they saw a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
