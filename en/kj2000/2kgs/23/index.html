And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his fatherâ€™s stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Pharaoh-neco put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and imposed on the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Pharaoh-neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Johoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-neco.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
