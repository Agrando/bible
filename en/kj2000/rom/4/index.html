Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputes righteousness without works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Comes this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his descendants, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the descendants; not to those only who are of the law, but to those also who are of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead, and calls those things which are not as though they were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your descendants be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body as now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
