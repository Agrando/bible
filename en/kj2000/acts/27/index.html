And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when we had put to sea from there, we sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when we had sailed over the sea near Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy; and he put us on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were hardly come off Cnidus, the wind not allowing us, we sailed close to Crete, off Salmone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, with difficulty passing it, came unto a place which is called The Fair Havens; near to which was the city of Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the cargo and ship, but also of our lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless the centurion believed the captain and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to depart from there also, if by any means they might arrive at Phoenix, and there to winter; which is a haven of Crete, and opens toward the southwest and northwest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, raising anchor, they sailed close by Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her be driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And running under a certain island which is called Cauda, we had much work to secure the boat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Which when they had hoisted it, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksand, struck sail, and so were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, you should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given you all them that sail with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>However we must be cast upon a certain island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the sailors deemed that they drew near to some country;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as the sailors were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense as though they would have cast anchors out of the bow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore I pray you to take some food: for this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And we were in all in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain bay with a shore, into which they were minded, if it were possible, to drive in the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and released the rudder bands, and hoisted up the foresail to the wind, and made toward shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the bow stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the stern was broken with the violence of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
