And he leaped and walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the priest of Jupiter, being before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they tore their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who in times past allowed all nations to walk in their own ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with these sayings scarcely restrained they the people, that they would not do sacrifice unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there came there certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>However, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had ordained elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And from there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there they abode a long time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
