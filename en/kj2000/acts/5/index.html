And she said, Yea, for so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said unto her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them who have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then she fell down immediately at his feet, and died: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and those who were tormented with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside before the doors: but when we had opened it, we found no man within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they were perplexed of what might come of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Saying, Did not we strictly command you that you should not teach in this name? and, behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to them that obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles outside a little while;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And said unto them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do concerning these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and came to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it; lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
