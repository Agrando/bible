when I have a convenient time, I will call for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He hoped also that money should have been given him by Paul, that he might release him: therefore he sent for him often, and conferred with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' position: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
