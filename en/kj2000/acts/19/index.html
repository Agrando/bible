And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said unto them, Unto what then were you baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all the men were about twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, arguing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, arguing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God did special miracles by the hands of Paul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon themselves to call over them who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, who did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And many that believed came, and confessed, and told of their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Many of them also who used magic arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover you see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, which are made with hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be discredited; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples allowed him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And certain of the chief of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, begging him that he would not venture into the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the majority knew not why they were come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the town clerk had quieted the people, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there that knows not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you have brought here these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them charge one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you inquire anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause for which we may give an account of this commotion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
