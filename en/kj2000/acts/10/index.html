And he said unto him, Your prayers and your alms are come up for a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside: he shall tell you what you ought to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the angel who spoke unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On the next day, as they went on their journey, and drew near unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet held at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In which were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the voice spoke unto him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This was done three times: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now while Peter wondered in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And called, and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Arise therefore, and get down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter went down to the men who were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the cause for which you are come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you to come into his house, and to hear words from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he called them in, and lodged them. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I came unto you without questioning as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent you have sent for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa, and call here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the seaside: who, when he comes, shall speak unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Immediately therefore I sent to you; and you have done well that you are come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded you of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>That word, I say, you know, which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he who was ordained of God to be the Judge of the living and dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them who heard the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to tarry certain days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
