And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, You men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as sojourners in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he brought them out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And about the time of forty years he endured their manners in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after that he gave unto them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who shall fulfill all my will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of this man's descendants has God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Savior, Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think you that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there comes one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets who are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised him from the dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he was seen many days of them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how the promise which was made unto the fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God has fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said in this way, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore he says also in another psalm, You shall not allow your Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no way believe, though a man declare it unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set you to be a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their district.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
