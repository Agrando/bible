I appeal unto Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shall you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to greet Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, when they were come here, without any delay the next day I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And because I was perplexed concerning such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, you shall hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the next day, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have petitioned me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination, I might have somewhat to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to specify the crimes laid against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
