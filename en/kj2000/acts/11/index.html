Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who shall tell you words, by which you and all your house shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then God gave them the same gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, that I could withstand God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now they who were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spoke unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cling unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, to seek Saul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that for a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught many people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren who dwelt in Judea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
