And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told you all things which are appointed for you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews who dwelt there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you shall be his witness unto all men of what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now why do you tarry? arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the clothing of them that slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send you far from here unto the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they gave him audience until this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know why they cried so against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what you do: for this man is a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then immediately they departed from him who should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>On the next day, because he would have known the certainty of why he was accused of the Jews, he released him, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
