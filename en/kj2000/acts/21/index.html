for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after those days we made ready, and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had greeted them, he declared particularly what things God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that you are come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Them take, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, of which they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, except only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to announce the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an offering should be offered for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews who were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers because of the violence of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as Paul was to be led into the barracks, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto you? Who said, Can you speak Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Are not you that Egyptian, who before these days made an uproar, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am a man who is a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech you, allow me to speak unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
