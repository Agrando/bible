And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he had brothers the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab as his wife: and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jehoram went forth with his officers, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotries, and led Judah astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says the LORD God of David your father, Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like the harlotries of the house of Ahab, and also have slain your brothers of your fatherâ€™s house, who were better than yourself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, with a great plague will the LORD strike your people, and your children, and your wives, and all your goods:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you shall have great sickness by disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out because of the sickness day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they came up into Judah, and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the kingâ€™s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was not a son left him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after all this the LORD struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his intestines fell out because of his sickness: so he died in great pain. And his people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without anyoneâ€™s regret. However they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
