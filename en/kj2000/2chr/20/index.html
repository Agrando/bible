and rule you not over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in your hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Are not you our God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and gave it to the descendants of Abraham your friend forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they dwelt in it, and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If, when evil comes upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in your presence, (for your name is in this house,) and cry unto you in our affliction, then you will hear and help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>O our God, will you not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Hearken you, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat, Thus says the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but Godâ€™s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow go you down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and you shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall you be established; believe his prophets, so shall you prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endures forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who were come against Judah; and they were defeated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to slay and destroy them utterly: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Judah came to the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in the gathering of the spoil, it was so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Beracah, unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came to Jerusalem with lyres and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>However the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has broken your works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
