And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come because of your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; for I had remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I have come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for the vision is for many days yet to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, because of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then there came again and touched me one having the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto you, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said he, Know you why I come unto you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I have gone forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that upholds me in these things, but Michael your prince.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
