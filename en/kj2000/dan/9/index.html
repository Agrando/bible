to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O Lord, to us belongs shame of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yea, all Israel have transgressed your law, even by departing, that they might not obey your voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand your truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore has the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now, O Lord our God, who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and has gotten yourself renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Lord, according to all your righteousness, I beseech you, let your anger and your fury be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all that are about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousness, but for your great mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, reached me about the time of the evening offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give you skill and understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the beginning of your supplications the commandment came forth, and I have come to show you; for you are greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Seventy weeks are determined upon your people and upon your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah, the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and its end shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
