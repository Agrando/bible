Then they brought these men before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do you not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if you are ready that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if not, be it known unto you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, and their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said unto his counselors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth out of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the satraps, administrators, and governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats affected, nor had the smell of fire come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, who speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made an ash heap: because there is no other God that can deliver in this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
