Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house, to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let the royal robes be brought which the king has worn, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the royal crown which is set upon his head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And let the robes and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man with whom the king delights to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sits at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then took Haman the robes and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delights to honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house mourning, and having his head covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the descendants of the Jews, before whom you have begun to fall, you shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And while they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
