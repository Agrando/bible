In all things you have proved yourselves to be pure in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause who had done the wrong, nor for his cause who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more we rejoiced at the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I have boasted anything to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found to be truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
