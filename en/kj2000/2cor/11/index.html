God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them who desire occasion; that when they glory, they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That which I speak, I speak it not according to the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will boast also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For you put up with fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you permit it, if a man brings you into bondage, if a man devours you, if a man takes of you, if a man exalts himself, if a man smites you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. But in whatsoever way any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the descendants of Abraham? so am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes beyond measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes less one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, three times I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides those things that are outside, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must boast, I will boast of the things which concern my weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forevermore, knows that I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of Damascus with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
