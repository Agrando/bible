Return unto me, and I will return unto you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, How shall we return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me. But you say, How have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You are cursed with a curse: for you have robbed me, even this whole nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Bring you all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, said the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all nations shall call you blessed: for you shall be a delightful land, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your words have been strong against me, says the LORD. Yet you say, What have we spoken so much against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked in mourning before the LORD of hosts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are raised up; yea, they that test God are even delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then shall you return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that serves him not.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
