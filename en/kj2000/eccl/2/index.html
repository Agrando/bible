Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how does the wise man die? as the fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and like grasping the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun: because I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore I gave my heart up to despair of all the labor in which I toiled under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that has not labored in it shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart, with which he has labored under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart takes not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who can eat, or who else can have enjoyment, more than I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and heaping up, only that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping of the wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
