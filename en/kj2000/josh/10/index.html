Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hastened not to go down about a whole day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And stay you not there, but pursue after your enemies, and attack their rear guards; allow them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were finished, that the rest which remained of them entered into fortified cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom you fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And afterward Joshua struck them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king he utterly destroyed, the people, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the LORD delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto its king as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he took it, and its king, and all its cities; and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Joshua struck all the country of the hills, and of the South, and of the lowland, and of the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Joshua struck them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
