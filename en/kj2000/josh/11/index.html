and they fell upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpah eastward; and they struck them, until they left none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and struck the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they struck all the souls that were there with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, did Joshua take, and struck them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for the cities that still stood in their strength, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the plain, and the mountains of Israel, its lowlands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even from the mount Halak, that rises up toward Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon below mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and struck them, and slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all others they took in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, any remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
