is not he that sits at table? but I am among you as he that serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You are they who have continued with me in my trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you have returned, strengthen your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with you, both into prison, and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before you shall three times deny that you know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and bag, and sandals, lacked you anything? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said he unto them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his bag: and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have a fulfillment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that you enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, Father, if you be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he rose up from prayer, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping from the grief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And said unto them, Why sleep you? rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betray you the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When they who were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered and said, No more of this. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, who were come to him, Do you come out, as against a thief, with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then they took him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But a certain maidservant beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And he denied it, saying, Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while another saw him, and said, you are also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter said, Man, I know not what you say. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and struck him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things blasphemously spoke they against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Are you the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, you will not believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And if I also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then said they all, Are you then the Son of God? And he said unto them, You say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
