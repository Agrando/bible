And he said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Strive to enter in at the narrow gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When once the Master of the house is risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know not where you come from:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then shall you begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he shall say, I tell you, I know not where you come from; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, behold, some are last who shall be first, and some are first who shall be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get out, and depart from here: for Herod will kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said unto them, Go, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless I must walk today, and tomorrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kills the prophets, and stones them that are sent unto you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and you would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, you shall not see me, until the time comes when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
