And he arose and stood forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they were filled with fury; and discussed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they that were troubled with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went power out of him, and healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed are you that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are you that weep now: for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe unto you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe unto you that are full! for you shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say unto you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bless them that curse you, and pray for them who despitefully use you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And unto him that smites you on the one cheek offer also the other; and he that takes away your cloak forbid not to take your coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to every man that asks of you; and of him that takes away your goods ask them not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if you love them who love you, what thanks have you? for sinners also love those that love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to them who do good to you, what thanks have you? for sinners also do even the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thanks have you? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be you therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Judge not, and you shall not be judged: condemn not, and you shall not be condemned: forgive, and you shall be forgiven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your lap. For with the same measure that you measure it shall be measured to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he spoke a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one that is perfect shall be as his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why behold you the speck that is in your brother's eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Either how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself behold not the beam that is in your own eye? you hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then shall you see clearly to pull out the speck that is in your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For a good tree brings not forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For every tree is known by its own fruit. For from thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And why call me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Whosoever comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man who built a house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
