I will send my beloved son: it may be they will respect him when they see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall come and destroy these tenants, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who should pretend themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither do you regard any person, but teach the way of God truly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why do you test me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the second took her as wife, and he died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, you have well said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And after that they dared not ask him any question at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And David himself said in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Till I make your enemies your footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David therefore called him Lord, how is he then his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Who devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater condemnation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
