And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we hoped that it was he who should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulcher;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And certain of them who were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he said unto them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew near unto the village, where they were going: and he made as though he would have gone further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, as he sat to eat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known to them in the breaking of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said unto them, Peace be unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said unto them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have you here any food?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he took it, and did eat before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it was fit for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And you are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you are endued with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
