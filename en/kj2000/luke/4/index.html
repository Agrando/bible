And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the devil said unto him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the devil, taking him up into a high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you therefore will worship me, all shall be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get you behind me, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, You shall not test the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him for a season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all bore him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto them, You will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, Verily, I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I tell you a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But unto none of them was Elijah sent, except unto Zarephath, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he passing through the midst of them went his way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the synagogue there was a man, who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and cried out with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know who you are; the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was ill with a high fever; and they besought him for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with various diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, You are Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them permitted them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and would have kept him, that he should not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
