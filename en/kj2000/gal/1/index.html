Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For do I now seek the favor of men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And advanced in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But other of the apostles saw I none, except James the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they had heard only, That he who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
