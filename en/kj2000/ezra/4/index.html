and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Israel, said unto them, You have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic, and set forth in the Aramaic language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this fashion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then wrote Rehum the commander, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, and the Elamites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and so forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Your servants the men on this side the river, send greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be it known unto the king, that the Jews who came up from you to us have come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and wicked city, and are finishing its walls, and repairing the foundations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city is built, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so you shall impair the revenue of the kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now because we receive support from the kingâ€™s palace, and it was not proper for us to see the kingâ€™s dishonor, therefore have we sent and informed the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so shall you find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and harmful unto kings and provinces, and that they have incited sedition within the city from of old: for which cause was this city destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We inform the king that, if this city is built again, and its walls finished, by this means you shall have no dominion on this side of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the commander, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and so forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The letter which you sent unto us has been plainly read before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city from of old has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Give you now command to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another command shall be given from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Take heed now that you fail not to do this: why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when the copy of king Artaxerxesâ€™ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then ceased the work on the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
