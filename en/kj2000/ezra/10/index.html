And they swore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came there, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the order of the leaders and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and he himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and because of the heavy rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, You have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the foreign wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you has said, so must we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter is turned from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the children of the captivity did so.
