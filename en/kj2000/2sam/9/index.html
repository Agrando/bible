And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Are you Ziba? And he said, Your servant is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold your servant!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your fatherâ€™s sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he bowed himself, and said, What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king called to Ziba, Saulâ€™s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto your masterâ€™s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You therefore, and your sons, and your servants, shall till the land for him, and you shall bring in the fruits, that your masterâ€™s son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth your masterâ€™s son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the kingâ€™s sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica.
