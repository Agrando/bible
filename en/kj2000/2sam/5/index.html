Therefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built all around from Millo inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israelâ€™s sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took himself more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also came and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth upon my enemies before me, as the breakthrough of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but go around behind them, and come upon them opposite the mulberry trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let it be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall move quickly: for then shall the LORD go out before you, to strike the army of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
