Also the LORD tells you that he will make you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your offspring after you, who shall proceed out of your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you: your throne shall be established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this was yet a small thing in your sight, O Lord GOD; but you have spoken also of your servantâ€™s house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what can David say more unto you? for you, Lord GOD, know your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For your wordâ€™s sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all these great things, to make your servant know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And what one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make himself a name, and to do for you great things and awesome, for your land, before your people, whom you redeemed to yourself from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For you have confirmed to yourself your people Israel to be a people unto you forever: and you, LORD, have become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it forever, and do as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let your name be magnified forever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of your servant David be established before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For you, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you a house: therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Lord GOD, you are that God, and your words are true, and you have promised this goodness unto your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
