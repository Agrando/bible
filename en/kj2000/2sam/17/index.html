For the LORD had purposed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they dared not be seen to come into the city: and a maidservant went and told them; and they went and told king David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a manâ€™s house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the woman took and spread a covering over the wellâ€™s mouth, and spread ground grain thereon; and the thing was not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when Absalomâ€™s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there was left not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a manâ€™s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joabâ€™s mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched grain, and beans, and lentils, and parched seed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
