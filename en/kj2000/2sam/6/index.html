So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was wearing a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saulâ€™s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he distributed among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to the women and to the men, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, who chose me before your father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I make merry before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will yet be more contemptible than this, and will be abased in my own sight: and of the maidservants whom you have spoken, of them shall I be held in honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
