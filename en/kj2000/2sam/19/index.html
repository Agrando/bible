For you have declared this day, that you regard neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased you well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak kindly unto your servants: for I swear by the LORD, if you go not forth, there will not tarry one with you this night: and that will be worse unto you than all the evil that befell you from your youth until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak you not a word of bringing the king back?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel has come to the king, even to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You are my brethren, you are my bones and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And say you to Amasa, Are you not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you be not captain of the army before me continually in the place of Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return you, and all your servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there went over a ferryboat to carry over the kingâ€™s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORDâ€™S anointed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore the king said unto Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Why went you not with me, Mephibosheth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because your servant is lame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he has slandered your servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For all of my fatherâ€™s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet did you set your servant among them that did eat at your own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king said unto him, Why speak you any more of your matters? I have said, You and Ziba divide the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with supplies while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king said unto Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will feed you with me in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Your servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with such a reward?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto you: and whatsoever you shall ask of me, that will I do for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all Davidâ€™s men with him, over Jordan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: why then are you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the kingâ€™s cost? or has he given us any gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than you: why then did you despise us, since our advice was first in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
