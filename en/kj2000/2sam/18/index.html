And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the people answered, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now you are worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that you support us from out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said unto them, What seems to you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains the charge concerning Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, you saw him, and why did you not strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten shekels of silver, and a belt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the kingâ€™s son: for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Otherwise I should have dealt falsely against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said Joab, I cannot tarry thus with you. And he took three spears in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And ten young men that bore Joabâ€™s armor compassed about and struck Absalom, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the kingâ€™s valley: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalomâ€™s pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joab said unto him, You shall not bear tidings this day, but you shall bear tidings another day: but this day you shall bear no tidings, because the kingâ€™s son is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, Come what may, let me, I pray you, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you have no tidings ready?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Come what may, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there are tidings in his mouth. And he came rapidly, and drew near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the gatekeeper, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the watchman said, I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the kingâ€™s servant, and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD has avenged you this day of all them that rose up against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
