And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the kingâ€™s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, And where is your masterâ€™s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that belonged unto Mephibosheth are yours. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed continually as he came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The LORD has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son: and, behold, you are taken in your mischief, because you are a bloody man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why have you done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth of my own body, seeks my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will repay me good for his cursing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hillâ€™s side opposite him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king, and all the people that were with him, became weary, and refreshed themselves there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, Davidâ€™s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? why went you not with your friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your fatherâ€™s presence, so will I be in your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto your fatherâ€™s concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred by your father: then shall the hands of all that are with you be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his fatherâ€™s concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
