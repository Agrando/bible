the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not take delight in your solemn assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Though you offer me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fatted beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But let justice run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have you offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch, and Chiun your star god, your images, which you made for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, says the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
