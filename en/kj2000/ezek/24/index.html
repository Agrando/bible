I will even make the pile for fire great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then set it empty upon its coals, that the bronze of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be melted in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She has wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I relent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet neither shall you mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the turban of your head upon you, and put on your shoes upon your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not manâ€™s bread of sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So I spoke unto the people in the morning: and at evening my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the people said unto me, Will you not tell us what these things are to us, that you so do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind shall fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And your turban shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he has done shall you do: and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Also, you son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that upon which they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That he that escapes in that day shall come unto you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In that day shall your mouth be opened to him who has escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you shall be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
