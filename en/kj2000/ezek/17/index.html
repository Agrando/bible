Shall he prosper? shall he escape that does such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, by casting up siege mounds, and building walls, to cut off many persons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will execute judgment on him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and you shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon a high and prominent mountain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a splendid cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every sort; in the shadow of its branches shall they dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
