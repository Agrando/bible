Is this act of your harlotries a small matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all your abominations and your harlotries you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were polluted in your blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after all your wickedness, (woe, woe unto you! says the Lord GOD;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That you have also built unto you an eminent place, and have made yourself a high place in every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You have built your high place at the head of every street, and have made your beauty to be abhorred, and have offered yourself to everyone that passed by, and multiplied your harlotries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You have also played the harlot with the Egyptians your neighbors, strong in lust; and have increased your harlotries, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your allowance of food, and delivered you unto the will of them that hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yea, you have played the harlot with them, and yet could not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You have moreover multiplied your harlotry with trading in the land of Chaldea; and yet you were not satisfied with this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How weak is your heart, says the Lord GOD, seeing you do all these things, the work of a brazen harlot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that you build your shrine at the head of every street, and make your high place in every street; and have not been as a harlot, in that you scorned payment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But as a wife that commits adultery, who takes strangers instead of her husband!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They give gifts to all harlots: but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and hire them, that they may come unto you on every side for your harlotry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And you are different from other women in your harlotries, therefore none follows you to commit harlotries: and in that you give a reward, and no reward is given unto you, therefore you are different.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus says the Lord GOD; Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your harlotries with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your children, which you did give unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all them that you have loved, with all them that you have hated; I will even gather them round about against you, and will uncover your nakedness unto them, that they may see all your nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrine, and shall break down your high places: they shall strip you also of your clothes, and shall take your beautiful jewels, and leave you naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women: and I will cause you to cease from playing the harlot, and you also shall give no hire any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So will I make my fury toward you to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense your way upon your head, says the Lord GOD: and you shall not commit this lewdness in addition to all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, every one that uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You are your motherâ€™s daughter, that loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And your elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at your left hand: and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet have you not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, you were corrupted more than they in all your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I live, says the Lord GOD, Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom, pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw fit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters in all your abominations which you have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>You also, who have judged your sisters, bear your own shame for your sins that you have committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than you: yea, be disgraced also, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of your captives in the midst of them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>That you may bear your own shame, and may be disgraced in all that you have done, in that you are a comfort unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, then you and your daughters shall return to your former state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Before your wickedness was discovered, as at the time of your reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise you round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For thus says the Lord GOD; I will even deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish unto you an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then you shall remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your elder and your younger: and I will give them unto you for daughters, but not by your covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know that I am the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>That you may remember, and be ashamed, and never open your mouth any more because of your shame, when I provide toward you an atonement for all that you have done, says the Lord GOD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
