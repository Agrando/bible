and he stood in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you; for to the intent that I might show them unto you are you brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the manâ€™s hand a measuring rod of six cubits long by the cubit and a handbreadth: so he measured the width of the building, one rod; and the height, one rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then came he unto the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its stairs, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one rod wide; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one rod wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And every little chamber was one rod long, and one rod wide; and between the little chambers were five cubits;

and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; the three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he measured the width of the entrance of the gate, ten cubits;

and its posts and arches were the same as the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and its width five and twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were the same as the measure of the gate that looks toward the east;

and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, on which they slew their sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high: on which also they laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And inside were hooks, a hand wide, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And outside the inner gate were the chambers for the singers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate; facing toward the south: one at the side of the east gate facing toward the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he said unto me, This chamber, facing toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers in charge of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the chamber facing toward the north is for the priests, the keepers in charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who come near to the LORD to minister unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, foursquare;
