And I answered, O Lord GOD, you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he said unto me, Prophesy to these bones, and say unto them, O you dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them over: but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off on our part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And shall put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall you know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, you son of man, take you one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel, his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, his companions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the children of your people shall speak unto you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sticks on which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, in which your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell there, even they, and their children, and their childrenâ€™s children forever: and my servant David shall be their prince forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the nations shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
