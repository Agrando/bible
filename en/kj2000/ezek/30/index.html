Wail, Alas for the day!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time for the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed people, and Cub, and the men of the land that are in league, shall fall with them by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus says the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the secure Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He and his people with him, the most terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be torn asunder, and Memphis shall have distresses daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
