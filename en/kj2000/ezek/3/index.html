Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not to many people of foreign speech and of a hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have hearkened unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto you; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Like adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And go, get you to them of the captivity, unto the children of your people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus says the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they refuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a loud rumbling, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a noise of a loud rumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, I have made you a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I say unto the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turns not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, When a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sins not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut yourself within your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put cords upon you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them one who reproves: for they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; He that hears, let him hear; and he that refuses, let him refuse: for they are a rebellious house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
