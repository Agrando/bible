And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD said unto Cain, Why are you angry? and why is your countenance fallen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you do well, shall you not be accepted? and if you do not well, sin lies at the door. And you shall be its desire, and you must rule over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abelyour brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries unto me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now are you cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield unto you its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shall you be in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that anyone that finds me shall slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be takenon him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael: and Methushael begat Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every forger in bronze and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man for wounding me, and a young man for hurting me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, has appointed me another child instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
