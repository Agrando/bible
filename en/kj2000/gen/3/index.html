And he said unto the woman, Yea, has God said, you shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the serpent said unto the woman, You shall not surely die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For God does know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you that you should not eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And unto Adam he said, Because you have listened unto the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the plants of the field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return unto the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and unto dust shall you return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also ofthe tree of life, and eat, and live forever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
