And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Gonot down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell you of:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for unto you, and unto your descendants, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham your father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will make your descendants to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto your descendants all these countries; and in your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men of the place asked him about his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a truth she is your wife: and how said you, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said, What is this you have done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guiltiness upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the man became great, and advanced, and grew until he became very great:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and a great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for you are much mightier than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Isaac departed from there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they dug another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he removed from there, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from there to Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham your father: fear not, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your descendants for my servant Abraham's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dug a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phicol the chief captain of his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaac said unto them, Why come you to me, seeing you hate me, and have sent me away from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you: and we said, Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you, and as we have done unto you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace: you are now the blessed of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said unto him, We have found water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who were a source of grief unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
