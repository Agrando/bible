Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, according as he made you swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very strong lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a mourning to the Egyptians: therefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly pay back to us all the evil which we did unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Your father did command before he died, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So shall you say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brothers, and their sin; for they did unto you evil: and now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are your servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now therefore fear not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joseph said unto his brothers, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
