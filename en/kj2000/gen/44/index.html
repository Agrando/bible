And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you do overtake them, say unto them, Why have you rewarded evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not this it from which my lord drinks, and by which indeed he divines? you have done evil in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said unto him, Why says my lord these words? God forbid that your servants should do according to this thing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomever of your servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and you shall be blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched, and began at the eldest, and ended at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they tore their clothes, and loaded every man his donkey, and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that you have done? Know you not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant: for you are even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you said unto your servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set my eyes upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you said unto your servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, you shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass when we came up unto your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And your servant my father said unto us, You know that my wife bore me two sons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you take this also from me, and mischief befall him, you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and your servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For your servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto you, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, I pray you, let your servant abide instead of the lad a slave to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
