Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son's mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? and would you take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in unto me; for surely I have hired you with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Leah said, God has given me my reward, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Leah said, God has endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God has taken away my reproach:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto my own place, and to my country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service which I have done you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Laban said unto him, I pray you, if I have found favor in your eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said unto him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown lambs among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So shall my honesty answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my wages before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he removed that day the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jacob took rods of green poplar, and of the almond and plane tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth flocks striped, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, when the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and donkeys.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
