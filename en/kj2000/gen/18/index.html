And they said, So do, as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hastened to dress it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said unto him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I will certainly return unto you according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah yourwife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have grown old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD said unto Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a certainty bear a child, who am old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but you did laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry, which has come unto me; and if not, I will know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Abraham drew near, and said, will you also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Suppose there be fifty righteous within the city: will you also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are there?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Suppose there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: will you destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke unto him yet again, and said, Suppose there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Suppose there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Suppose ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left speaking with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
