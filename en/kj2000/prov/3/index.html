but let your heart keep my commandments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Let not mercy and truth forsake you: bind them about your neck; write them upon the table of your heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust in the LORD with all your heart; and lean not unto your own understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not wise in your own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It shall be health to your body, and strength to your bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honor the LORD with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out with new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the gain from it is better than the gain from silver, and the profit thereof than fine gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you can desire are not to be compared unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is everyone that retains her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, let not them depart from your eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So shall they be life unto your soul, and grace to your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yea, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the ruin from the wicked, when it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being snared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say not unto your neighbor, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Strive not with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Envy you not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the perverse is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Surely he scorns the scornful: but he gives grace unto the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the recompense of fools.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
