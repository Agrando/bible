These things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you can not bear them who are evil: and you have tried them who say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And have endured, and have patience, and for my name's sake have labored, and have not fainted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember therefore from where you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your lampstand out of its place, except you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things says the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear none of those things which you will suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write; These things says he who has the sharp sword with two edges;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know your works and where you dwell, even where Satan's throne is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days when Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So have you also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows except him who receives it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things says the Son of God, who has his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine bronze;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know your works, and love, and service, and faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave her time to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say; I will put upon you no other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But that which you have already hold fast till I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he that overcomes, and keeps my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to pieces: even as I received of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
