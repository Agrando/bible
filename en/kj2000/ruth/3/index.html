Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshingfloor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put your best clothes upon you, and get down to the floor: but make not yourself known unto the man, until he shall have finished eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay down; and he will tell you what you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she said unto her, All that you say unto me I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my daughter: for you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, in that you followed not young men, whether poor or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you require: for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however there is a kinsman nearer than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could recognize another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also he said, Bring the cloak that you have upon you, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, How are you, my daughter?
