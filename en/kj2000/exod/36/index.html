And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all the wise men, that were doing all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which he had made;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they spoke unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.
