he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If a thief be found breaking in, and be smitten that he dies, there shall no blood be shed for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or donkey, or sheep; he shall restore double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his animal, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that the stacks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field, be consumed ; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or goods to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he has put his hand unto his neighbor's goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If a man deliver unto his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he has not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it shall accept the oath, and he shall not make it good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it as evidence, and he shall not make good that which was torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man borrow anything of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or dies, the owner of itbeing not with it, he shall surely make it good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the owner of it be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for its hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If her father utterly refuses to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall not allow a witch to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever lies with an animal shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that sacrifices unto any god, except unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You shall neither wrong a stranger, nor oppress him: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you afflict them in any way, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And my wrath shall grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If you lend money to any of my people who is poor among you, you shall not be to him as a lender, neither shall you charge him interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If you at all take your neighbor's clothing as pledge, you shall deliver it unto him by the time the sun goes down:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For that is his only covering, it is his clothing for his skin: in what shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he cries unto me, that I will hear;
