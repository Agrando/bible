And he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
