And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with defiance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamped by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not this the word that we did tell you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said unto the people, Fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall see them again no more forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Why do you cry unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his host, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its place when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
