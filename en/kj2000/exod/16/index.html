And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take every man for them who are in his tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they did measure it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said, Let no man leave any of it till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left some of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was angry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun grew hot, it melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD has said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which you will bake today, and boil that which you will boil; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto the LORD: today you shall not find it in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See, for the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the border of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
