every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, in which they shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs, and with the inner parts thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thus shall you eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD'S passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shallnot be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and you shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you; no manner of work shall be done on them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this very same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall you observe this day in your generations by an ordinance forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings shall you eat unleavened bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in unto your houses to slay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it shall come to pass, when you are come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean you by this service?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That you shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and go forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they requested of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they gave unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very many cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the very same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no foreigner eat of it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But every man's servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth any of the flesh outside of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when a foreigner shall sojourn with you, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the foreigner who sojourns among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass the very same day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
