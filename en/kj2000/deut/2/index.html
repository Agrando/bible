And we went over the brook Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the time in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were perished from among the camp as the LORD swore unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were perished and dead from among the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That the LORD spoke unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You are to pass over through Ar, the boundary of Moab, this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when you come near the border of the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(That also was regarded as a land of giants: giants dwelt there formerly; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Avvim who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear reports of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we defeated him, and his sons, and all his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon you came not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbade us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
