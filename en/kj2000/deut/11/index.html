how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them unto this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until you came into this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore shall you keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, wherever you go to possess it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And that you may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their descendants, a land that flows with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from where you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the land, where you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water from the rain of heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That I will give you the rain of your land in its due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, and your wine, and your oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will send grass in your fields for your cattle, that you may eat and be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And then the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit;
