as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before your face: so shall you drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD has said unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Speak not you in your heart, after that the LORD your God has cast them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD does drive them out from before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Understand therefore, that the LORD your God gives you not this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, and forget not, how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you did depart out of the land of Egypt, until you came unto this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also in Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get you down quickly from here; for your people whomyou have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Furthermore the LORD spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I looked, and, behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which you sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which the LORD was angry with you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron and would have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended out of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, you provoked the LORD to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the landwhich I have given you; then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and you believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and your inheritance, which you have redeemed through your greatness, which you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Lest the land from which you brought us out should say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your outstretched arm.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
