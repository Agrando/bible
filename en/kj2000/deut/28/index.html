and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So that you shall be driven mad by the sight of your eyes which you shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The LORD shall strike you in the knees, and in the legs, with painful boils that cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot unto the top of your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The LORD shall bring you, and your king which you shall set over you, unto a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known;

for the locust shall consume it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You shall plant vineyards, and dress them, but shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You shall beget sons and daughters, but you shall not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All your trees and fruit of your land shall the locust consume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The stranger that is among you shall rise up above you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover all these curses shall come upon you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, till you are destroyed; because you hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they shall be upon you for a sign and for a wonder, and upon your descendants forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Because you served not the LORD your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Therefore shall you serve your enemies which the LORD shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he has destroyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The LORD shall bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he shall eat the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your land, until you are destroyed: who also shall not leave you either grain, wine, or oil, or the increase of your cattle, or offspring of your sheep, until he has destroyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted, throughout all your land: and he shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which the LORD your God has given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And you shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the distress, with which your enemies shall distress you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So that the man that is gentle among you, and very refined, his eye shall show no compassion toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave behind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he has nothing left him in the siege, and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you in all your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The gentle and refined woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot upon the ground because of her gentleness and refinement, her eye shall show no compassion toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And toward her afterbirth that comes out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for lack of all things secretly in the siege and distress, with which your enemy shall distress you in your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD YOUR GOD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then the LORD will make your plagues abundant, and the plagues of your descendants, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, of long continuance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Moreover he will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon you, until you are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And you shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nothing; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear day and night, and shall have no assurance of your life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning you shall say, Would God it were evening! and at evening you shall say, Would God it were morning! because of the fear of your heart by which you shall fear, and because of the sight of your eyes which you shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again in ships, by the way of which I spoke unto you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall be sold unto your enemies as male and female slaves, and no man shall buy you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
