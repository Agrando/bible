as the camel, and the hare, and the rock badger: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the swine, because it divides the hoof, yet chews not the cud, it is unclean unto you: you shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These you shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall you eat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whatsoever has not fins and scales you may not eat; it is unclean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Of all clean birds you shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the buzzard, and the falcon, and the kite after their kinds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And every raven after its kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the ostrich, and the nighthawk, and the sea gull, and the hawk after their kinds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The little owl, and the great owl, and the water hen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the pelican, and the carrion vulture, and the cormorant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And every winged insect is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But of all clean fowls you may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it unto the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it;
