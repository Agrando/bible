A Song of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not yourself from my supplication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart is greatly pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Destroy, O Lord, and confuse their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But it was you, a man my equal, my guide, and my close friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let death seize upon them, and let them go down alive into the grave: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abides of old.
