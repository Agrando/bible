I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked are before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My heart was hot within me, while I was meditating the fire burned: then spoke I with my tongue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>LORD, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, you have made my days as a handbreadth; and my age is as nothing before you: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.
