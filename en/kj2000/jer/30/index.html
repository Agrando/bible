why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacobâ€™s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For it shall come to pass in that day, says the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds, and strangers shall no more enslave them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore fear you not, O my servant Jacob, says the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save you from afar, and your descendants from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am with you, says the LORD, to save you: though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you, yet will I not make a full end of you: but I will correct you in just measure, and will not leave you altogether unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says the LORD, Your bruise is incurable, and your wound is grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All your lovers have forgotten you; they seek you not; for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of your iniquity; because your sins were increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why cry you over your affliction? your sorrow is incurable for the multitude of your iniquity: because your sins were increased, I have done these things unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all they that devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and they that plunder you shall be plunder, and all that prey upon you will I make a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health unto you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says the LORD; because they called you an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus says the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacobâ€™s tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built upon its own mound, and the palace shall stand in its proper place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their nobles shall be from themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that devoted his heart to approach unto me? says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goes forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he has done it, and until he has performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
