And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the kingâ€™s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entrance of the new gate of the LORDâ€™S house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then spoke Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will relent concerning the evil that he has pronounced against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seems good and right unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But know you for certain, that if you put me to death, you shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon its inhabitants: for of a truth the LORD has sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Micah the Moresthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD relented himself of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they brought forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
