or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then shall you say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, says the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, you walk everyone after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that you know not, neither you nor your fathers; and there shall you serve other gods day and night; where I will not show you favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says the LORD, and they shall catch them; and afterward will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For my eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the nations shall come unto you from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things in which there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
