Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Since as there is none like unto you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who would not fear you, O King of nations? for to you is it due: since among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they are altogether senseless and foolish: the wooden idol is a doctrine of vanities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman, and of the hands of the goldsmith: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of skillful men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to endure his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus shall you say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens at his discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings with rain, and brings forth the wind out of his storehouses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every man is senseless in his knowledge: every goldsmith is put to shame by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their judgment they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up your wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may find it so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent is plundered, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent anymore, and to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the shepherds have become senseless, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, the noise of the report has come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O LORD, correct me, but with justice; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out your fury upon the nations that know you not, and upon the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
