So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go hide, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribeâ€™s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four columns, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yet they were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll: but he would not hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take you again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus says the LORD; You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written in it, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and beast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore thus says the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will punish him and his descendants and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
