This has been your manner from your youth, that you obeyed not my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall eat up all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then you shall be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makes your nest in the cedars, how gracious shall you be when pangs come upon you, the pain as of a woman in travail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As I live, says the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck you from there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will give you into the hand of them that seek your life, and into the hand of them whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will cast you out, and your mother that bore you, into another country, where you were not born; and there shall you die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land to which they desire to return, there shall they not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel in which is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his descendants, and are cast into a land which they know not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus says the LORD, Write this man down as childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his descendants shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
