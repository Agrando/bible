Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, plundering and great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For in the ascent of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the descent of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee, save your lives, and be like the bush in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the plunderer shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for its cities shall be desolate, without any to dwell in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Cursed is he that does the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed is he that keeps back his sword from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his dregs, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will send unto him wine tippers, that shall tip him over, and shall empty his vessels, and break his jars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How say you, We are mighty and strong men for the war?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moab is plundered, and gone up out of her cities, and her chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The calamity of Moab is near at hand, and his affliction hastens quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All you that are about him, bemoan him; and all you that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You daughter that does inhabit Dibon, come down from your glory, and sit in thirst; for the plunderer of Moab shall come upon you, and he shall destroy your strongholds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch; ask him that flees, and her that escapes, and say, What has happened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moab is put to shame; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell it in Arnon, that Moab is plundered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And judgment has come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Make him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For was not Israel a derision unto you? was he found among thieves? for when you spoke of him, you wagged your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>O you that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that makes her nest in the sides of the caveâ€™s mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceedingly proud) his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I know his wrath, says the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore will I wail for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; my heart shall mourn for the men of Kir-heres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer: your plants have gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the plunderer has fallen upon your summer fruit and upon your vintage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, like a heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, says the LORD, he that offers in the high places, and he that burns incense to his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the riches that he has gotten have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be gashes, and upon the loins sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in its streets: for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which is no pleasure, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They shall wail, saying, How it is broken down! how has Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismay to all them about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thus says the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle. and shall spread his wings over Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are surprised, and the mighty menâ€™s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in birth pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their punishment, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of exhaustion: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the brow of Moab, the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Woe be unto you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perish: for your sons are taken captives, and your daughters captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, says the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
