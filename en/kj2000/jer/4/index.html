Woe unto us! for we are ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims affliction from mount Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make mention to the nations; behold, proclaim against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Like keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she has been rebellious against me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your way and your doings have procured these things unto you; this is your wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reaches unto your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My soul, my soul! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is plundered: suddenly are my tents plundered, and my curtains in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For my people are foolish, they have not known me; they are stupid children, and they have no understanding: they are wise to do evil, but how to do good they have no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thus has the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not relent, neither will I turn back from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when you are plundered, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with crimson, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain shall you make yourself fair; your lovers will despise you, they will seek your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For I have heard a voice like a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewails herself, that spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
