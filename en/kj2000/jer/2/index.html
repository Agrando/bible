and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will yet plead with you, says the LORD, and with your childrenâ€™s children will I plead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For pass over the coasts of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Has a nation changed its gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be astonished, O you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be you very desolate, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed themselves out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he plundered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The young lions roared upon him, and growled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also the children of Noph and Tahpanes have broken the crown of your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have you not brought this unto yourself, in that you have forsaken the LORD your God, when he led you by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the LORD your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For from of old I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will nottransgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a wild vine unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs in the wind in her desire; in her mating time who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Saying to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where are your gods that you have made yourself? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why will you plead with me? you all have transgressed against me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O generation, see you the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Why beautify your way to seek love? therefore have you also taught the wicked ones your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also on your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but plainly upon all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Why gad you about so much to change your way? you also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yea, you shall go forth from him, with your hands upon your head: for the LORD has rejected your trusted ones, and you shall not prosper in them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
