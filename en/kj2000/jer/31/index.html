is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart is troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him,says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Set up signposts, make yourself landmarks: set your heart toward the highway, even the way which you went: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>How long will you go about, O you backsliding daughter?
