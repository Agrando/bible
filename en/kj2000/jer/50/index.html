publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell in it: they shall move, they shall depart, both man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In those days, and in that time, says the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces toward it, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, lo, I will raise up and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a skilled warrior; none shall return in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Chaldea shall be a plunder: all that plunder her shall be satisfied, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because you were glad, because you rejoiced, O you destroyers of my heritage, because you have grown fat like a heifer threshing grain, and bellow like bulls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Your mother shall be utterly confounded; she that bore you shall be ashamed: behold, the least of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: everyone that goes by Babylon shall be appalled, and hiss at all her plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all you that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shout against her round about: she has given her hand: her foundations have fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she has done, do unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people, and they shall flee everyone to his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria has devoured him; and last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In those days, and in that time, says the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I preserve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, says the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how has Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, O Babylon, and you were not aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have contended against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The LORD has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day has come, the time of their punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Call together the archers against Babylon: all you that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none of them escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do unto her: for she has been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I am against you, O you most proud, says the Lord GOD of hosts: for your day has come, the time that I will punish you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus says the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A sword is upon the Chaldeans, says the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A sword is upon the diviners; and they shall become fools: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mixed people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad over their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert shall dwell there with the jackals, and the ostriches shall dwell in it: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, says the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not show mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, everyone set in array, like a man for the battle, against you, O daughter of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The king of Babylon has heard the report of them, and his hands grew feeble: anguish took hold of him, and birth pangs as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the thickets of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will arraign me? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore hear you the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
