For I will cause to return the captives of the land, as at the first, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities, shall be a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counts them,says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name by which it shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus says the LORD; David shall never lack a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Neither shall the priests, the Levites, lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn grain offerings, and to sacrifice continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus says the LORD; if you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the descendants of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider you not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, as if they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus says the LORD; If my covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then will I cast away the descendants of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his descendants to be rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
