go out to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his own ability; and immediately took his journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made five other talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And likewise he that had received two, he also gained another two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he that had received one went and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After a long time the lord of those servants came, and settled accounts with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so he that had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, Lord, you delivered unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His lord said unto him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter into the joy of your lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter into the joy of your lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not spread:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth: lo, there you have what is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>His lord answered and said unto him, You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not spread:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received my own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him who has ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For unto everyone that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I was hungry, and you gave me food: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you hungry, and fed you? or thirsty, and gave you drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When saw we you a stranger, and took you in? or naked, and clothed you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Or when saw we you sick, or in prison, and came unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Since you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I was hungry, and you gave me no food: I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and you visited me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you hungry, or thirsty or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Since you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
