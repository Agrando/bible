This is he who received seed by the way side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he that received the seed in stony places, the same is he that hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet has he not root in himself, but endures for a while: for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he is offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that hears the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that received seed in the good ground is he that hears the word, and understands it; who also bears fruit, and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good seed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the plant was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? from where then has it tares?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said unto them, An enemy has done this. The servants said unto him, Will you then that we go and gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, Nay; lest while you gather up the tares, you root up also the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather you together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable spoke he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things spoke Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spoke he not unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said unto them, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking fine pearls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said unto them, Have you understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe who is instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when he came into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And his sisters, are they not all with us? from where then has this man all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
