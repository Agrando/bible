Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That your alms may be in secret: and your Father who sees in secret himself shall reward you openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you, when you pray, enter into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be not therefore like them: for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this manner therefore pray: Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Your kingdom come. Your will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us this day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That you appear not unto men to fast, but unto your Father who is in secret: and your Father, who sees in secret, shall reward you openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be sound, your whole body shall be full of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that darkness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body than clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why take you thought for clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, How shall we be clothed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Take therefore no thought for tomorrow: for tomorrow shall take thought of the things for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
