A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under a bushel, but on a lamp stand; and it gives light unto all that are in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Verily I say unto you, you shall by no means come out of there, till you have paid the last penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if your right eye causes you to offend, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is better for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand causes you to offend, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is better for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It has been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not perjure yourself, but shall perform unto the Lord your oaths:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Neither shall you swear by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these comes from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>You have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say unto you, That you resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if any man will sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whosoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him that asks you, and from him that would borrow of you turn not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you, and persecute you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love them who love you, what reward have you? do not even the tax collectors the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you greet your brethren only, what do you more than others? do not even the tax collectors so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
