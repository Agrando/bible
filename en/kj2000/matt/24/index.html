and shall deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in various places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All these are the beginning of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall grow cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then let them who are in Judea flee into the mountains:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that nurse a child in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But pray you that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, I have told you before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as the lightning came out of the east, and shines even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For wherever the carcass is, there will the vultures be gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give its light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When its branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So likewise you, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your Lord does come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But know this, that if the owner of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Therefore be you also ready: for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has made ruler over his household, to give them food at the proper time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
