Thus have you made the commandment of God void by your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These people draw near unto me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that whichcomes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Know you that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus said, Are you also yet without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not yet understand, that whatsoever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into the drain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands defiles not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus went from there, and departed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same regions, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, you son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she cries after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then came she and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he answered and said, It is not right to take the children's bread, and cast it to dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And she said, True, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is your faith: be it unto you even as you will. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus departed from there, and came near unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and put them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away without food, lest they faint in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his disciples said unto him, From where should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have you? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken pieces that were left seven baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he sent away the multitude, and embarked in the ship, and came into the region of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
