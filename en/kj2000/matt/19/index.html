What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts allowed you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her who is put away does commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples said unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, only they to whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are some eunuchs, who were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, who were made eunuchs of men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Allow little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he laid his hands on them, and departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said unto him, Why do you call me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said unto him, Which? Jesus said, You shall do no murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honor your father and your mother: and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said unto him, If you will be perfect, go and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what shall we have therefore?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And everyone that has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
