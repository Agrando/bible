Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they came to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and is very ill: for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you? bring him here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked the demon; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say unto this mountain, Remove from here to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceedingly sorry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they came to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Does not your teacher pay tribute?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus preceded him, saying, What think you, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter said unto him, Of strangers. Jesus said unto him, Then are the children free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However, lest we should offend them, go to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and when you have opened its mouth, you shall find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
