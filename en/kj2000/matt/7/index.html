Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore by their fruits you shall know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not every one that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out demons? and in your name done many wonderful works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore whosoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his teachings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
