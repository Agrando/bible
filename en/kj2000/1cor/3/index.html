But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For no other foundation can a man lay than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall test every man's work of what sort it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man's work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man defiles the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
