And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and struck Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left-handed: and by him the children of Israel sent tribute unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Ehud made himself a dagger which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he did gird it under his clothes upon his right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he brought the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people that bore the tribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he himself turned back at the stone images that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret message unto you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer chamber, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto you. And he arose out of his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hilt also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the chamber behind him, and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he is relieving himself in his summer chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the chamber; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the stone images, and escaped unto Seirath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he was before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and allowed not a man to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all strong, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
