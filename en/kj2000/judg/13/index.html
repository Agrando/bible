And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Manoah said, Now let your words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your food: and if you will offer a burnt offering, you must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is your name, that when your sayings come to pass we may do you honor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why ask you thus after my name, seeing it is wonderful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took a kid with a grain offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did a wondrous thing; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told us such things as these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
