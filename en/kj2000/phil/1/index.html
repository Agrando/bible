only that, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your manner of life be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
