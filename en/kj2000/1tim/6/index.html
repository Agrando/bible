These things teach and exhort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting over questions and disputes of words, out of which comes envy, strife, railings, evil suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Perverse wranglings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having food and clothing let us be with these things content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I give you charge in the sight of God, who brings all things to life, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That you keep this commandment without spot, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Charge them that are rich in this present age, that they be not haughty, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to share;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain utterances, and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
