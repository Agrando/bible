For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O Assyria, the rod of my anger, the staff in their hand is my indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will send him against a godless nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet he means not so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations, not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he says, Are not my princes altogether kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord has performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he says, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the boundaries of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathers eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall the ax boast itself against him that hews with it? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that uses it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were not wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a sick man wastes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that struck them; but shall lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the destruction decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make the destruction decreed, in the midst of all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall strike you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash he has stored his supplies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They are gone over the pass: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul has fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laishah, O poor Anathoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Madmenah has fled; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his fist against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop off the boughs with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall before the mighty one.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
