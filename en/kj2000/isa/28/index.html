and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and taken from the breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom he said, This is the rest with which you may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men, that rule this people who are in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with sheol are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not be in haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Justice also will I make the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then you shall be beaten down by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From the time that it goes forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a terror just to understand the report.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself upon: and the covering narrower than he can wrap himself in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the LORD shall rise up as on mount Perazim, he shall be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his awesome work; and bring to pass his act, his alien act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore be not mockers, lest your bonds be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a destruction, even determined upon the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Does the plowman keep plowing all day to sow? does he keep opening and breaking the clods of his ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he has made level the face of it, does he not sow the dill, and scatter the cummin, and plant the wheat in rows and the barley and the spelt in their places?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For his God does instruct him aright, and does teach him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, neither is a cart wheel rolled over the cummin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cummin with a rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bread grain is ground; therefore he will not forever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor crush it with his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also comes forth from the LORD of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
