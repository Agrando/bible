The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and arrogance of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with hewn stones: the sycamores are cut down, but we will replace them into cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with an open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the people turn not unto him that strikes them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed, in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The elder and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet that teaches lies, he is the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led by them are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For wickedness burns as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the rising of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land burned, and the people shall be as the fuel for the fire: no man shall spare his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall devour on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Manasseh shall devour Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah.
