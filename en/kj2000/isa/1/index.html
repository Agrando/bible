you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither soothed with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a hut in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Unless the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? says the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of male goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash you, make yourself clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Learn to do good; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How has the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of justice; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore says the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will rid myself of my adversaries, and avenge myself of my enemies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will turn my hand upon you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and take away all your alloy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For you shall be ashamed of the sacred oaks which you have desired, and you shall be embarrassed for the gardens that you have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall be as tinder, and the work of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
