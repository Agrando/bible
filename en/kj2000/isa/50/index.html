Behold, for your iniquities have you sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die of thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he awakens morning by morning, he awakens my ear to hear as the learned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked out the beard: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is my adversary? let him come near to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall grow old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is among you that fears the LORD, that obeys the voice of his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and rely upon his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all you that kindle a fire, that encircle yourselves with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that you have kindled.
