These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, you are our gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger whom I sent? who is blind as he who is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Seeing many things, but you observe not; opening the ears, but he hears not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivers; for a spoil, and none says, Restore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he has poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it has set him on fire all around, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
