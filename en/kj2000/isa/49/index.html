They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make all my mountains a roadway, and my highways shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these shall come from afar: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have engraved you upon the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your children shall make haste; your destroyers and they that made you waste shall go forth from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lift up your eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, says the LORD, you shall surely clothe yourself with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on you, as a bride does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For your waste and your desolate places, and the land of your destruction, shall even now be too narrow for the inhabitants, and they that swallowed you up shall be far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The children which you shall have, after you have lost the other, shall say again in your ears, The place is too narrow for me: give a place to me that I may dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then shall you say in your heart, Who has begotten for me these, since I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and moving to and fro? and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thus says the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contends with you, and I will save your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
