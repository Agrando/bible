Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hear the word of the LORD, you that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that renders recompense to his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? says your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That you may nurse, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that you may drink deeply, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall you nurse, you shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens following one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those of them that escape unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the coastlands afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your descendants and your name remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall go forth, and look upon the corpses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
