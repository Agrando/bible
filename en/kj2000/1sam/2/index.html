And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh, unto all the Israelites that came there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled meat from you, but raw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, Nay; but you shall give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give you offspring of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all these people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the LORD's people to transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one man sins against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sins against the LORD, who shall intercede for him? Nevertheless they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD desired to slay them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the child Samuel grew, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of your father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why trample you on my sacrifice and on my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore the LORD God of Israel says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever: but now the LORD says, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And any man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart: and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this shall be a sign unto you, that shall come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall both of them die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
