And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had attacked a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was held in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together to Saul at Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Saul said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you came not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I felt compelled therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly: you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you: for now would the LORD have established your kingdom upon Israel forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now your kingdom shall not continue: the LORD has sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be ruler over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leads to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looks upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, and his mattock, and his ax, and his sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the charge was a third of a shekel for the plowshares, and for the mattocks, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son they were found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
