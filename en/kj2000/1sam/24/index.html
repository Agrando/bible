Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe stealthily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart troubled him, because he had cut off Saul's robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David restrained his servants with these words, and allowed them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Saul, Why hear you men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you: but my eye spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you; yet you hunt my soul to take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The LORD judge between me and you, and the LORD avenge me of you: but my hand shall not be upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As says the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked: but my hand shall not be upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to David, you are more righteous than I: for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you have shown this day how that you have dealt well with me: for when the LORD had delivered me into your hand, you killed me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? therefore the LORD reward you with good for what you have done unto me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, behold, I know well that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got themselves up unto the stronghold.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
