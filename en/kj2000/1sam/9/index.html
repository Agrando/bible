And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father cease caring for the donkeys, and become anxious for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he says comes surely to pass: now let us go there; perhaps he can show us our way that we should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came today to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people today in the high place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he comes, because he does bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat who are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time you shall find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spoke to you of! this same shall reign over my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for you shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, set not your mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you, and on all your father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you so to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chief place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said unto you, Set it by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before you, and eat: for unto this time has it been kept for you since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel talked with Saul upon the top of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the dawn of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand you still awhile, that I may show you the word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
