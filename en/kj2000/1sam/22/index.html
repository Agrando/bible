Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or shows unto me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Saul said unto him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for your servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king said, you shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Nob, the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, and oxen, and donkeys, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have caused the death of all the persons of your father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Abide you with me, fear not: for he that seeks my life seeks your life: but with me you shall be safe.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
