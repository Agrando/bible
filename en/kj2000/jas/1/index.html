For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and its flower falls, and the beauty of the appearance of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is the man that endures trial: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the anger of man works not the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore put away all filthiness and extreme wickedness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues in it, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man among you seems to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure religion and undefiled before God the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
