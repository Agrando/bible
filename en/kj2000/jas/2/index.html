Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judges?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convicted of the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you commit no adultery, yet you kill, you are become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What does it profit, my brethren, though a man says he has faith, and has not works? can faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be warmed and filled; yet you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what does it profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that there is one God; you do well: the demons also believe, and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>See how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
