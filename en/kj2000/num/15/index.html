and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to follow harlotry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That you may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
