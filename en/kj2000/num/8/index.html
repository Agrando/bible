he lighted the lamps thereof in front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And this work of the lampstand was of hammered gold, its shaft and its flowers were hammered work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus shall you do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then let them take a young bullock with its grain offering, even fine flour mixed with oil, and another young bullock shall you take for a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of meeting: and you shall gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus shall you separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of meeting: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal: on the day that I struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of meeting, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come near unto the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is what pertains to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of meeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
