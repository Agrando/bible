And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Go up this way into the South, and go up into the mountains:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell there, whether they are strong or weak, few or many;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities there are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what the land is, whether it is rich or poor, whether there be wood in it, or not. And be of good courage, and bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they ascended through the South, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came unto the Valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and they brought some of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they told him, and said, We came unto the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nevertheless the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, who come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
