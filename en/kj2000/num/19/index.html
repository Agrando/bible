her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he that burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of purification: it is a purification for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he that gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be unto the children of Israel,and unto the stranger that sojourns among them, for a statute forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall purify himself with the water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whosoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifies not himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD;
