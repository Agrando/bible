If any man walks in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things said he: and after that he said unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleeps, he shall do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Thomas, who is called Didymus, unto his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Bethany was near unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I know, that even now, whatsoever you will ask of God, God will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said unto her, Your brother shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is come, and calls for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews then who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in his spirit, and was troubled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And said, Where have you laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself came to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said unto her, Said I not unto you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people who stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, You know nothing at all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went from there unto the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the Jews' passover was near at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think you, that he will not come to the feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
