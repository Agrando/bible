As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, you are the branches: He that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a man abides not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are my friends, if you do whatsoever I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I command you, that you love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you were of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin: but now they have no cover for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that hates me hates my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them the works which no other man did, they would not have sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But this comes to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
