And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asks me, Where do you go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he is come, he will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Of sin, because they believe not on me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things that the Father has are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said unto us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore, What is this that he said, A little while? we cannot tell what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do you inquire among yourselves of what I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour has come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: but this we believe that you came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the hour comes, yea, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
