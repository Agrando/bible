Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abides forever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, and be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he that sees me sees him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
