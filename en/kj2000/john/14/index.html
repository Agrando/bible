I go to prepare a place for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there you may be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And where I go you know, and the way you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas said unto him, Lord, we know not where you go; and how can we know the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father, but by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you had known me, you would have known my Father also: and from henceforth you know him, and have seen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip said unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it will satisfy us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said unto him, Have I been so long a time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatsoever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If you love me, keep my commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas said unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself unto us, and not unto the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man loves me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Comforter, who is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you.
