He that honors not the Son honors not the Father who has sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You sent unto John, and he bore witness unto the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father himself, who has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And you will not come to me, that you might have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I receive not honor from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I am come in my Father's name, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe, who receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
