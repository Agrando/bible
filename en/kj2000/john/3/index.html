and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Marvel not that I said unto you, You must be born again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it came, and where it goes: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said unto him, Are you a Teacher of Israel, and know not these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, We speak what we do know, and testify what we have seen; and you receive not our witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For everyone that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John was not yet cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bear witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must increase, but I must decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He that has received his testimony has set his seal to this that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
