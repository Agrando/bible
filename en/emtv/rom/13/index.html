For there is no authority except by God, and the authorities that exist are instituted by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Consequently the [one] resisting the authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and those opposing shall receive judgment to themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are not a fear to good works, but to evil. And do you wish not to fear the authority?[ ]Do what is good, and you shall have praise from the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do evil, fear; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's servant, an avenger for wrath to the [one] practicing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For on account of this you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render therefore to all their dues: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe nothing to no one, except to love one another, for he who loves one another has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, "You shall not commit adultery,""You shall not murder,""You shall not steal,""You shall not covet,"and [if ]there is any other commandment, in this word it is summed up, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And do this, knowing the time, that [it is] already[ the] hour for us to be roused out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we [first ]believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is advanced, the day is at hand. Therefore let us put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelries and drinking bouts, not in orgies and debaucheries, not in strife and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for [its] lusts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
