To his own master he stands or he falls. And he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One indeed judges one day above another; but another judges every day [the same]. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that regards the day, regards it to the Lord; and he that does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. And he that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he that does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and he gives thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ died and rose and lived [again], so that He might be Lord of both [the] dead and [the] living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written: "As I live, says the LORD, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each of us shall give account concerning himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let us no longer judge one another, but judge this rather, not to put a stumbling block or an offense before our brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean of itself; except to him considering anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if your brother is grieved on account of your food, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food the one on behalf of whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore do not let your good be slandered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he that serves Christ in these things is well pleasing to God and approved by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore let us pursue the things [which make] for peace and the things by which one may edify another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but [are] evil for the man eating with offense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor [to do anything] by which your brother stumbles or is offended or becomes weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you have faith? By yourself, have it before God. Blessed is he that does not condemn himself in what he approves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who doubts, if he eats, has been condemned, because [it is ]not of faith; and everything which [is] not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
