But if the husband should die, she is released from the law of the husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So then, while the husband is living, she will be called an adulteress if she becomes [married] to a different husband; but if her husband should die, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, having become [married] to a different husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore, my brothers, you also were put to death to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another-to Him who was raised from the dead, so that we might bear fruit to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions aroused through the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now we were released from the law, having died in [that] to which we were held fast, so that we should serve as slaves in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we say then? Is the law sin? By no means! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known lust unless the law had said, "You shall not covet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of lust. For apart from the law sin [was] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the commandment, which [was] to [bring] life, I found to [bring] death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, deceived me, and by it, killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then has that which is good become death to me? By no means! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through that which is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, having been sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For what I am doing, I do not know. For what I want to do, I do not do; but what I hate, this I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that [it is] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But now [it is] no longer I [who] am doing it, but the sin living in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but [how] to do the good, I do not find.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good that I want to do I do not do; but the evil I do not want to do, this I practice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I [who] do it, but the sin living in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore I find this law, that [when] I wish to do the right[ thing], evil is right there with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God in my inner being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I see a different law in my members, waging war against the law of my mind, and capturing me by the law of sin which is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from this body of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with the mind serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
