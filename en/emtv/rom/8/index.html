But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is alive because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit indwelling in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brothers, we are debtors-not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if you live according to the flesh you shall die; but if by [the] Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again unto fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, "Abba, Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if children, then heirs-heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer together, so that we may also be glorified together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly awaits the unveiling of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it in hope;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>because even the creation itself shall be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that all the creation groans together and labors in birth together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only that, but also [we ]ourselves having the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting adoption, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For by this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he[ ]sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly await it with endurance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But He that searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes on behalf of the saints according to [the will] [of] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to [His ]purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who [can be] against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up on behalf of us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he that condemns? Christ is the [One] having died, but rather also having been raised, who is even at [the] right [hand] of God, who also intercedes on our behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Just as it is written: "For Your sake we are put to death the whole day long; we are accounted as sheep for slaughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height nor depth, nor anything else in creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
