Shall we go on sinning so that grace may abound?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>By no means! We died to sin-How shall we live any longer in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Or do you not know that as many [of us] as were baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be [in the likeness] of [His] resurrection;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>knowing this, that our old man was crucified [with Him], so that the body of sin may be done away with, [that] we should no longer serve sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he who has died has been justified from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if we died with Christ, we believe that we also shall live together with Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, no longer dies. Death is no longer master [over] Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For what [death] He died, He died to sin once for all; but what [life] He lives, He lives to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Likewise you also, consider yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>nor present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves to whom you obey, whether of sin [resulting] in death, or of obedience [resulting] in righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thanks be to God, that though you used to be slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from [your] heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I speak in human terms on account of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness, and to lawlessness [resulting] in [more] lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness [resulting] in sanctification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So what fruit did you have then of which [things] you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now having been freed from sin, and having become enslaved to God, you have your fruit [resulting] in sanctification, and the end, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin [is] death, but the gift of God [is] eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
