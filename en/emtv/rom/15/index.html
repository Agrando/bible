Praise Him, all you peoples!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, Isaiah says: "There shall be the root of Jesse; and He that shall rise to rule over the Gentiles, in Him the Gentiles shall hope."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I write more boldly to you brothers, in part, as reminding you, because of the grace having been given to me by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that I should be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God as a priest, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I have something to boast of in Christ Jesus in the things pertaining to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ did not work out through me, in word and deed, for the obedience of [the] Gentiles-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so eagerly striving to evangelize not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon the foundation of another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but as it is written: "To whom He was not announced, they shall see; and those who have not heard shall understand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For this reason I also have been hindered many times from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now no longer having a place in these regions, and having a longing to come to you for many years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whenever I travel to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope [while] traveling through to see you, and to be sent forward there by you, if I may be filled in part [from] you first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I am traveling to Jerusalem ministering to the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Macedonia and Achaia thought it good to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they thought it good, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles shared in spiritual things, they are obligated also to minister to them in material things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, having finished and having sealed to them this fruit, I shall go by way of you to Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know that coming to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I beg you, brothers, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in prayers to God on my behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>so that in joy I may come to you through the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
