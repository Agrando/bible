First of all, that they were entrusted with the [very ]words of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>By no means! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar, just as it is written: "That You may be justified in Your words, and You may prevail when You are judged."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Surely] God, the [One ]inflicting wrath is not unrighteous, is [He]? (I speak as a man).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>By no means! For otherwise how shall God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if by my lie the truth of God has abounded to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And why not say, "Let us do evil so that good may come"?-just as we are slandered, and just as some affirm that we say. [The] judgment of whom is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Are we [any] better? Not at all. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Just as it is written: "There is none righteous, no not one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is none who understands; there is none who seeks God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All [have ]turned aside; together they became unprofitable; there is not [one] doing kindness, there is not so much as one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Their throat is an opened grave; with their tongues they deceived"; "[the ]poison of asps is under their lips";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ruin and misery are in their ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the way of peace they did not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that as many things as the law says, it speaks to those under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore by works of the law no flesh shall be justified in His sight, for through the law [comes] [the] knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now the righteousness of God apart from the law has been revealed, being witnessed to by the Law and the Prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>even the righteousness of God, through [the] faithfulness of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all those that believe. For there is no distinction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, for a demonstration of His righteousness through the passing over of the sins having previously committed, in the forbearance of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for a demonstration of His righteousness in the present time, that He might be just and the justifier of he who has [the] faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or is He the God of the Jews only? But is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>since there is one God who will justify [the ]circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore do we nullify the law through faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold [the] law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
