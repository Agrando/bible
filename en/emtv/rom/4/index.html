"Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now to him who works, his wage is not reckoned as a gift, but as his due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>just as David also speaks of the blessing of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Blessed [are] [they] whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed is the man to whom the LORD shall by no means impute sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Does this blessing then come upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had while ]in uncircumcision, so that he should be the father of all those that believe, although uncircumcised, so that righteousness should also be imputed to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the father of circumcision to those not only of circumcision, but also to those following in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham[ had while] in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through [the] law, but through [the] righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if those who are of [the] law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise has been nullified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>because the law produces wrath; for where there is no law neither is there transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore it is of faith that it may be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those[ ]of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(just as it is written, "I have appointed you a father of many nations") before God, whom he believed, the [One] who gives life to the dead and calls those things which are not as though they were;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, contrary to hope, on hope believed, so that he should become a father of many nations, according to what was spoken, "So shall your descendants be."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not weakening in faith, he did not consider his own body, already having been worn out (being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>he did not waver at the promise of God in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And therefore "it was credited to him as righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was credited to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but for us also, to whom it was going to be credited, those believing on Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was delivered up for our transgressions, and was raised for our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
