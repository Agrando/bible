By no means! For I too am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know [what the Scripture says] in Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"LORD, they killed Your prophets and they torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what does the divine response say to him? "I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So to then, at this present time, there is also a remnant according to the election of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if by grace, [it is] no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if [it is ]of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained [it], and the rest were blinded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Just as it is written: "God has given them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, down to this very day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David says: "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a recompense to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? By no means! But by their transgression, salvation [has come] to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if their transgression is [the] riches of the world, and their defeat is [the] riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if somehow I may provoke to jealousy my fellow Jews, and I may save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if their casting away means reconciliation [for the] world, what will their acceptance be, if not life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the firstfruit is holy, [so] also the lump; and if the root is holy, so also the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in [among] them, and became a partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not be arrogant towards the branches. But if you are arrogant, [remember] that it is not you that supports the root, but the root [supports] you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That is true. By unbelief they were broken off, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps He may not spare you either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold then the kindness and severity of God: upon those that fell, severity; but upon you, kindness, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they also, if they do not remain in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more shall these, the natural ones, be grafted into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers, lest you be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written: "The Deliverer shall come out of Zion, and He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As regards to the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sake; but as regards to election, [they are] beloved for the sake of the fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now you were shown mercy through their disobedience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>even so these now were disobedient, that through the mercy shown you they also might be shown mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has consigned all to disobedience, that He might show mercy to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and[ ]knowledge of God! How unsearchable [are] His judgments and untraceable [are ]His ways!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"For who has known [the] mind of the LORD? Or who has been His counselor?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Or who has first given to Him, and it shall be repaid to him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For of Him and through Him and to Him [are] all things; to Him [be] the glory forever! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
