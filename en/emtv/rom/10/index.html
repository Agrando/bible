"(that is, to bring Christ down)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>or, "'Who shall descend into the abyss?' "(that is, to bring up Christ from the dead).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"(that is, the word of faith which we proclaim):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and you believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes on Him shall not be put to shame."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For "whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD shall be saved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then shall they call on Him in[ ]whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear apart from a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how shall they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, of those preaching the gospel of good things!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then faith [comes] by hearing, and hearing by [the] word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, have they not heard? Yes, indeed [they have]: "Their voice went out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says: "I will provoke you to jealousy by [those who are] not a nation, by a foolish nation I will anger you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Isaiah is very bold and says: "I was found by those who did not seek Me; I was made manifest to those who did not ask for Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But to Israel he says: "the whole day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
