Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all those of Israel [are of] Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>nor [are they] all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, "In Isaac your seed shall be called."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God; but [it is ]the children of the promise that are regarded as descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is the word of promise: "At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only this, but also Rebecca having conception from one [man], our father Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for [the children] not yet being born, nor having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works but of Him who calls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was said to her, "The older shall serve the younger."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we say then? [Is ]there unrighteousness with God? By no means!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God who shows mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may show My power in you, and that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But indeed, O man, who are you to [be ]answering back against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, "Why have you made me like this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or does not the potter have the right over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and the other for dishonor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But what if God, wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and so that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>even us whom He called, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As also in Hosea He says: "I will call those My people who were not My people, and her beloved, who was not beloved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"And it shall be in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not My people,' there they shall be called sons of the living God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the sons of Israel were as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For He is finishing and cutting short an account in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short account upon the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And just as Isaiah foretold: "If the LORD of hosts had not left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have resembled Gomorrah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained righteousness, even the righteousness of faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to the law of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why? Because [they did] not [seek it] by faith, but rather by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stone of stumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Just as it is written: "Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offense, and everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
