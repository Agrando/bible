Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that you are turning so quickly from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is not another; except there are certain people who trouble you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach a gospel to you other than what we preached to you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, and I say again just now, if anyone preaches a gospel to you other than what you received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I make known to you, brothers, the gospel preached by me is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my former conduct at one time in Judaism, that beyond measure I used to persecute the church of God, and I was devastating it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I was advancing in Judaism above many my own age, being far more zealous for the traditions of my forefathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal His Son in me, so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and I stayed with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which are in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they heard only, "He who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which at one time he was devastating."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
