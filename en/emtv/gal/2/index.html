By no means!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if I build again the[ ]things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not annul the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
