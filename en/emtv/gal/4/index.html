You have not wronged me at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You know that because of weakness in the flesh I preached the gospel to you the former [time.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise nor disdain, but as an angel of God you received me, even as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then was your blessing? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have I therefore become your enemy by speaking the truth to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are zealous about you in the wrong way; but they wish to shut you out, so that you will be zealous about them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I wanted to be present with you just now and to change my tone; because I am uncertain about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you not hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by the servant girl, the other by a freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who was of the servant girl was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>which things are symbolic. For these are two covenants: one in fact from Mount Sinai, bearing children into slavery, which is Hagar-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in slavery with her children-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written: "Rejoice, O barren, who does not give birth; break forth and shout, who does not have birth pangs; because the children of the desolate are many more than those of her who has a husband."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But we, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But just as then the [one] who was born according to the flesh persecuted the [one born] according to the Spirit, so also it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl shall by no means inherit with the son of the freewoman."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brothers, we are not children of the servant girl, but of the free[woman].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
