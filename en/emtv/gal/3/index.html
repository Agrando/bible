Who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was portrayed publicly among you as crucified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>This only do I wish to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, will you now be made perfect in the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have you suffered so many things in vain-If indeed [they] really [were] in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Just as Abraham "believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Know therefore that those who are of faith, these are sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, [saying] that, "In you all the nations shall be blessed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things which are written in the book of the law, to do them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But that no one is justified by the law before God is evident, for "The just shall live by faith."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the law is not of faith, but "the man who does them shall live by them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brothers, I speak in human fashion: A covenant is of a man, yet having been confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises spoken. He does not say, "And to seeds,"as of many, but as of one, "And to your Seed,"who is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, does not annul the covenant previously confirmed to Christ by God, so that it make the promise of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance [comes] by the law, it is no longer of promise; but God has given it to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the Seed should come to whom it had been promised; and it was commanded through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the mediator is not for one person, but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, [is] the law against the promises of God? By no means! For if a law had been given which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, having been hemmed in for the faith which was to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore the law has become our custodian, [leading us] to Christ, so that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
