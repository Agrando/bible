"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Earlier saying, "Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and [sacrifices] for sin You did not desire, nor had pleasure in them"(which are offered according to the law),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then He has said, "Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God."He takes away the first in order that He may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which are never able to take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But He Himself, having offered one sacrifice for sins forever, He sat down at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>from that time waiting till His enemies are placed as a footstool for His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws on their hearts, and I will inscribe them on their minds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and their sins and their lawless deeds I shall by no means remember any longer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and [having] a High Priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies having been washed with clean water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let us consider one another for the stirring up of love and of good works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves, just as is the custom for some, but exhorting [one another], and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery zeal being about to devour the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Anyone disregarding the law of Moses dies without compassions on [the testimony of] two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By how much worse punishment, do you think, will he be deemed worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, and has regarded as common the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know Him who said, "Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,"says the Lord. And again, "The LORD will judge His people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a fearful [thing] to fall into the hands of the living God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But remember the former days, in which after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle of sufferings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>in part being exposed publicly, both to reproaches and to afflictions, and in part having become partners of those treated in this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For you sympathized with me in my chains, and you received the plunder of your possessions with joy, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and enduring possession in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has a great recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For you have need of endurance, so that having done the will of God, you may receive the promise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the just shall live by faith, and if he withdraws, My soul has no pleasure in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of [those] shrinking back to destruction, but of faith, to the saving of the soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
