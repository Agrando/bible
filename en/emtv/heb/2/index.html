But now we do not yet see all things having been subjected to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, through the suffering of death, having been crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God, He might taste death for everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was fitting for Him, on account of whom [are] all things and through whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the Author of their salvation through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying: "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to You."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again: "I will put My trust in Him."And again: "Behold I and the children to whom God has given Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore since the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same things, in order that through death He might destroy the [one] having the power of death, that is, the devil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and that He might set free these, as many as by fear of death through all of their lives, were subject to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For indeed He does not take hold of angels, but He does take hold of the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore He was obligated to become like His brothers in all [respects], in order that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things [pertaining] to God, in order that He might make propitiation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in that which He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to help those who are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
