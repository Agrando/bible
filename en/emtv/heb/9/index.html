concerning these things we cannot now speak in detail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but into the second [part] the high priest [goes] alone once during the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the people's sins committed in ignorance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>which [was] symbolic for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are being offered, which are not able, in respect to conscience, to make perfect the [one] performing the service,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[concerned] only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances which are imposed until a time of reformation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Christ came [as] a High Priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered once for all into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling those having been defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>by how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, will cleanse your conscience from dead works in order that we might serve the living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And on account of this He is the Mediator of the new covenant, so that, since a death has occurred for redemption of the transgressions at the time of the first covenant, that those having been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where there [is] a testament, there is necessity for death to be offered of the [one] making the testament.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For a testament is valid over dead [people], since it is never valid when the [one] making the testament lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore not even the first [covenant] has been dedicated without blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses according to law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore it [was] necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens to be continually purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves by better sacrifices than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Christ did not enter into [the] holies made by hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters into the Holies every year with another's blood-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>since it would have been necessary [for] Him to suffer often from the foundation of the world; but now, once at the consummation of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin through the sacrifice of Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men once to die and after this judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time apart from sin unto salvation, to those who eagerly await Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
