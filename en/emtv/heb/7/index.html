but there[ is] the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And inasmuch as [it was] not without an oath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him that said to Him: "The LORD has sworn and will not relent, 'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek' ",</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>by so much more Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But He, because He remains forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those coming to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, innocent, undefiled, having been separated from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices beforehand, on behalf of His own sins and then for the people's, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, [appoints] a Son who has been perfected forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
