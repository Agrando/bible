For He Himself has said, "By no means shall I desert you, nor in any way shall I forsake you;"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>so that being confident, we may say: "The LORD is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you, of whom considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not be carried away with various and strange doctrines. For it is good [for] the heart to be established by grace, not by foods, by which those having walked were not profited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For of the animals, [whose ]blood is brought into the Holies by the high priest [as an offering ]for sin, the bodies [of these animals] are burned outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore Jesus also, so that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let us go out to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have no permanent city, but we seek the [city ]which is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore through Him let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing to His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But do not forget the doing of good and generosity, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Obey your leaders, and submit to [them], for they keep watch over your souls, as giving an account, in order that they may do this with joy and not groaning, for this [would be] unprofitable for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us; for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live commendably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I especially urge [you] to do this, in order that I may be restored to you more quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now may the God of peace, who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the everlasting covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I appeal to you, brothers, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Know [that] our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you, if he comes quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Greet all your leaders, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Grace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
