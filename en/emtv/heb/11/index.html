And he went out, not knowing where he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he migrated into a land of promise as [in] a foreign [land], dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he waited for the city having foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith Sarah herself also received power for conception of seed, and she bore a child past the normal age, because she regarded [Him] faithful who had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore even from one [man ]they were begotten, and him as good as dead, just as the stars of the sky in multitude, and innumerable as the sand by the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died according to faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off and welcoming [them], and confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For those saying such things make evident that they seek a fatherland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And indeed if they had remembered that land from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now they desire a better [land], that is, a heavenly [one]. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, had offered up Isaac, and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>of whom it was spoken, "In Isaac your seed shall be called,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>considering that even from the dead, God [was] able to raise [him up], from which he also received him in a figurative sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped, [leaning] on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, when he was dying, remembered concerning the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw a beautiful child; and they did not fear the edict of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to have the temporary pleasure of sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>regarding the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king; for he endured as seeing the Unseen [One].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land, whereas the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith the prositute Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more should I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, both Barak and Samson and Jephthah, both David and Samuel and the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who through faith overcame kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in battle, turned to flight the armies of foreigners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received their dead [back] by resurrection. And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Still others took a trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and of chains and of prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tried, they were slain, being murdered with the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, being in want, being afflicted, being ill treated,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And all these, having obtained witness through their faith, did not receive the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
